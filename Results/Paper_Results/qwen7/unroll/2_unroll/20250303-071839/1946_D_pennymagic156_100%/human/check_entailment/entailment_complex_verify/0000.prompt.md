You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

    #Explanation: The loop iterates over bit positions from 29 to 0. For each bit position, it checks the bit values of `x` and the elements in `a`. If both bits are 0, it skips. If the bit in `x` is 0 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is odd, it returns `ans`. If the bit in `x` is 0 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is even, it performs some operations on `a` and updates `t`. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is odd, it skips. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is even, it calculates the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in `a` for that bit position and updates `ans`. If the bit in `x` is 1 and the corresponding bit in `a`'s sum is 0, it breaks the loop. After the loop, `t` remains empty, `ans` contains the maximum count of consecutive 1s, and other variables retain their original values.
    return max(ans, len(a))
    #The program returns the maximum value between ans (which is the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in a for each bit position from 29 to 0) and the length of the list a.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum count of consecutive 1s found in the binary representation of the elements in the list `a` for each bit position from 29 to 0. It then returns the maximum value between this count and the length of the list `a`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( k \) such that the specified conditions are met. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works for all described cases:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes necessary variables and reads input correctly using custom functions.
2. **Bitwise Analysis**: The program iterates over bits from the most significant bit (29th bit) to the least significant bit (0th bit). This ensures that we consider the highest possible contribution of each bit to the final result.
3. **XOR and OR Operations**: For each bit position, it checks if the current bit of \( x \) is set (1) or not (0). Depending on this, it either skips further processing or proceeds to calculate the number of valid segments.
4. **Segment Calculation**: When the bit of \( x \) is 0 and the corresponding bit in the array sum is odd, it calculates the number of valid segments by iterating through the array and counting contiguous segments where the XOR of the segment is 0.
5. **Optimization**: It optimizes the process by breaking early if no valid segments can be formed for the current bit.

Given the structure and logic of the program, it appears to handle all edge cases and meet the problem description accurately. No specific counterexample was found that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
