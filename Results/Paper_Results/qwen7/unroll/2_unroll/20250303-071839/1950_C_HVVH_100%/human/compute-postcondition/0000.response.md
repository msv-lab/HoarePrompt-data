Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, `day` is 'AM'**.

The code assigns the string `'AM'` to the variable `day`. This changes the value of `day` but does not affect the value of `t`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial value of `t` within its given range and sets `day` to `'AM'`.
