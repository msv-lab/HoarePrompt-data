Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `h` is exactly 12 correctly. According to the problem description, when `h` is 12, it should be represented as "12:xx PM". However, the program incorrectly sets `day` to 'AM' when `h` is 12, which results in incorrect output for times like "12:00" and "12:59".

For example, for the input "12:00", the program outputs "12:00 AM" instead of "12:00 PM". This is because the condition `if h == 12:` is followed by setting `day = 'PM'`, but this change is not applied due to the subsequent `else` block setting `day = 'AM'`.
