Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`, and a string `s` consisting of characters from 'A' to 'F'. It calculates a value `ans` based on the counts of characters in `s` and the integer `m`. Specifically, `ans` is incremented by `m` for each character in 'ABCDEF' that is not present in `s`, and for each character present in `s`, `ans` is incremented by the difference between `m` and the count of that character in `s`. Finally, it prints the cumulative sum of all `ans` values after processing all test cases.**
