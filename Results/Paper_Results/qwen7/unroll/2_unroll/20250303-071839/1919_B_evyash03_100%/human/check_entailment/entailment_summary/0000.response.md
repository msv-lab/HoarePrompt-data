Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k`, where the penalty of each subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The total penalty is the sum of penalties of these subarrays.

2. **Current Implementation**: The function `func_1` simply counts the number of '+' characters in the string `expression` and calculates the absolute difference between the length of `expression` and this count. This does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` to minimize the total penalty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: To minimize the penalty, one should aim to balance the number of '+' and '-' characters in each subarray. For example, if the string is `+-+-+`, the optimal split would be `([1, -1], [1, -1], [1])` with penalties `0, 0, 1` respectively, giving a total penalty of `1`.

4. **Correct Approach**: A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to ensure that each subarray has a minimal penalty. However, the current implementation does not achieve this.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
