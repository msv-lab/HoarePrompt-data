Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting an array `a` derived from the string `s` into non-empty subarrays such that the penalty is minimized.
2. The penalty for a single subarray is defined as the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
3. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `expression` and returns this value. This approach does not consider the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should aim to balance the positive and negative contributions to the sum of the subarrays. The correct approach would be to split the array at points where the cumulative sum changes sign, ensuring that each subarray has a minimal penalty.

Given the current implementation, the function does not achieve the intended goal of minimizing the penalty.

Correctness: **False**
