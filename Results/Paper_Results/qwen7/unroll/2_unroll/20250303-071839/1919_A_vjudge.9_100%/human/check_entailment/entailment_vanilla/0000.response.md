### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After each move, one coin is removed from the player's current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces the number of coins in each player's wallet by 1 per turn until one player's wallet is empty.
   - The player who faces an empty wallet first loses.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, the player whose turn it is can always mirror the opponent's moves, ensuring that the game ends when both wallets are empty simultaneously.
   - If `a` and `b` are not equal, the player with the larger number of coins can always force the opponent into a losing position by ensuring the difference between `a` and `b` remains odd.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program correctly checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the absolute difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).
   - It correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the difference between `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the optimal strategy described. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
