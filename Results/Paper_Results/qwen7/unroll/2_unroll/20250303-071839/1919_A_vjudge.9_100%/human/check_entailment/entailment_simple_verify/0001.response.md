### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Mechanics**:
   - Each player can either swap wallets or keep them.
   - After each move, one coin is removed from the player's current wallet.
   - The player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The game essentially reduces the number of coins in each player's wallet by 1 per turn until one player's wallet is empty.
   - The player who faces an empty wallet first loses.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If `a` and `b` are equal, the player whose turn it is can always mirror the opponent's moves, ensuring that the game ends when both wallets are empty simultaneously.
   - If `a` and `b` are not equal, the player with the larger number of coins can always force the opponent into a losing position by ensuring the difference between `a` and `b` remains odd.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program correctly checks if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is even or odd.
   - If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob".
   - If the absolute difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all given constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).
   - However, the implementation does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is read as an integer, and there are `t` test cases.
  - For each test case, `a` and `b` are read as integers.

- **Key Points in the Annotated Code**:
  - The program iterates over each test case.
  - For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.
  - If the absolute difference is even, it prints "Bob".
  - If the absolute difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

- **Analyze the Logic**:
  - The logic in the program checks if `abs(a - b)` is even or odd.
  - This condition does not accurately reflect the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

### Example Analysis:

- **First Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 1`
  - `abs(1 - 1) = 0` (even)
  - Output: "Bob"
  - **Correct Output**: "Bob" (as the game ends immediately with both wallets empty)

- **Second Test Case**:
  - Input: `1 4`
  - `abs(1 - 4) = 3` (odd)
  - Output: "Alice"
  - **Correct Output**: "Alice" (as Alice can force Bob into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains odd)

- **Third Test Case**:
  - Input: `5 3`
  - `abs(5 - 3) = 2` (even)
  - Output: "Bob"
  - **Correct Output**: "Bob" (as the game ends with both wallets empty)

- **Fourth Test Case**:
  - Input: `4 5`
  - `abs(4 - 5) = 1` (odd)
  - Output: "Alice"
  - **Correct Output**: "Alice" (as Alice can force Bob into a losing position by ensuring the difference remains odd)

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly determines the winner based on the parity of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. According to the optimal strategy, the player who can ensure the difference remains odd will win if `a` and `b` are not equal. The program should check if the sum of `a` and `b` is even or odd instead.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
