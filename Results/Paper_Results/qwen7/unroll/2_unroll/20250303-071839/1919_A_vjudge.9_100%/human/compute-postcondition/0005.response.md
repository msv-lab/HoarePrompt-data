Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it checks whether the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd. If the difference is even, it prints "Bob"; if the difference is odd, it prints "Alice". After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
