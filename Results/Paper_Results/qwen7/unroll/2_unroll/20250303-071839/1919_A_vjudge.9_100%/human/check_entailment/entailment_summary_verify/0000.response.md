### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description:
- Alice and Bob take turns removing one coin from their wallets.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.
- The goal is to determine the winner based on the initial number of coins in each player's wallet.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        if abs(a - b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it checks whether the absolute difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is even or odd.
- If the difference is even, it prints "Bob".
- If the difference is odd, it prints "Alice".

#### Analysis:
1. **Game Logic vs. Parity Check**:
   - The provided program incorrectly uses the parity of the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the winner.
   - According to the problem, the winner is determined by the ability to force the opponent into a losing position, not just the parity of the difference.

2. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the test case \(a = 5\) and \(b = 3\).
     - Initially, Alice has 5 coins and Bob has 3 coins.
     - Alice can swap wallets, giving her 3 coins and Bob 5 coins.
     - Now, Bob has 5 coins and Alice has 3 coins.
     - Bob can swap back, giving him 3 coins and Alice 5 coins.
     - This process continues, and the key is to see if one player can always force the other into a losing position.
   - In this scenario, Alice can always force Bob into a position where he cannot make a valid move by ensuring that the difference between their coins remains odd after her turn.
   - Therefore, Alice should win in this case, not Bob.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach involves determining if the initial difference \(|a - b|\) is odd or even.
   - If the initial difference is odd, Alice can always ensure that the difference remains odd after her turn, forcing Bob into a losing position.
   - If the initial difference is even, Bob can always ensure that the difference remains even after his turn, forcing Alice into a losing position.

Given the analysis, the provided program is indeed incorrect because it does not account for the strategic aspect of the game. The correct logic should be based on the parity of the initial difference, not just the parity of the difference at each step.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement.
