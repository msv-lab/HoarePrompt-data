Output State: **`idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is even; the values of `n` and `k` are set by the input.split(' ') method; `permutation` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros; `curr_v` is 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes `curr_v` to 1. Since no other variables are affected, the values of `idx`, `idx_v`, `n`, `k`, and `permutation` remain unchanged from their initial states.
