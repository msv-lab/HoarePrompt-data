Output State: **`idx` is 0, `n` is an integer where 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` and `k` is even; the values of `n` and `k` are set by the input.split(' ') method; `permutation` is a list of length `n` containing only zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `idx` to 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the `permutation` list also remains unchanged.
