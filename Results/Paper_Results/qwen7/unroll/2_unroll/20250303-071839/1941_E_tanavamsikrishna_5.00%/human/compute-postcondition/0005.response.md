Output State: `total_costs` is a list of length `n - (k - 1)`, where each element is the sum of every consecutive sub-list of `costs` with length `k`. The elements in `total_costs` correspond to the sums of sub-lists starting from the first element of `costs` up to the element at index `n - k` of `costs`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values, and `rows` retains its original structure and values.
