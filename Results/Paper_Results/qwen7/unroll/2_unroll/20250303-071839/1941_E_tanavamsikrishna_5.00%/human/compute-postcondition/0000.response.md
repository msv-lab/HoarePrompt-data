Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` are assigned the integer values from the input split by spaces; rows is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains m positive integers representing the depths of the river cells, and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0.**

Explanation: The code reads four integers `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` from the input and splits them by spaces. These values are then assigned to the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`. The precondition that `rows` is a list of `n` lists, where each inner list contains `m` positive integers and the first and last elements of each inner list are guaranteed to be 0, remains unchanged.
