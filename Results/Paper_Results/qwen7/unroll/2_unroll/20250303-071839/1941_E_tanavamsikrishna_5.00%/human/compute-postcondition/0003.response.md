Output State: **`total_costs` is an empty list, `costs` is a list of length `n` where each element is the result of `func_1(row, d)` for each row in `rows`; `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d` retain their original values; `rows` retains its original structure and values.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list called `total_costs`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables (`costs`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and `rows`). Therefore, the length and content of the `costs` list remain unchanged, and the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `d`, and the structure of `rows` stay the same.
