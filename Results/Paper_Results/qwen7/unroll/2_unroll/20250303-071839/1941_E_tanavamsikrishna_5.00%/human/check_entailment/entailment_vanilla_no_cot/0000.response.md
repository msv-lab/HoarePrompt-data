Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the cost of placing supports in a single row of the river.
   - It ensures that the cost of placing a support in each cell is adjusted according to the constraints:
     - A support must be installed in the first and last cells of the row.
     - The distance between any two adjacent supports must be no more than `d`.
   - The function iterates through the row, updating the cost of placing a support in each cell based on the minimum cost of the previous `d` cells plus one.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the entire input and calculates the minimum total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows.
   - It reads the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and `d`.
   - It then reads the depths of each row into a list of lists called `rows`.
   - For each row, it calls `func_1` to calculate the cost of placing supports.
   - It stores these costs in a list called `costs`.
   - Finally, it calculates the total cost of building `k` bridges on consecutive rows by summing up the costs of the rows in different combinations and finds the minimum total cost.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the minimum total cost of installing supports for the bridges. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
