Reasoning:
The provided program `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by using modular arithmetic to find pairs `(i, j)` such that both conditions for a "beautiful pair" are met. However, there are several issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Modular Arithmetic Calculation**: The code calculates `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` incorrectly. Specifically, `required_mod_x` should be calculated as `(num - a[i]) % x` rather than `(x - num % x) % x`. Similarly, `required_mod_y` should be `num % y`.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage**: The frequency dictionary `freq` is used to count occurrences of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs. However, the logic for updating and checking this dictionary is flawed. The code should increment the count of `(mod_x, mod_y)` and check if the corresponding `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in the dictionary.

3. **Pair Counting Logic**: The logic for counting beautiful pairs is incorrect. The current implementation increments the count based on the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pairs, but it should instead be based on the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs.

Given these issues, the provided program will not correctly calculate the number of beautiful pairs.

Correctness: **False**
