Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definition and Input Parsing:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of dictionaries containing test case parameters).
   - It initializes an empty list `results` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Loop Through Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, and `y` from the dictionary.
   - It also extracts the array `a`.
   - It prints the parameters and the array for debugging purposes.

3. **Frequency Dictionary Initialization:**
   - A dictionary `freq` is initialized to keep track of the frequency of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs:**
   - For each element `num` in the array `a`:
     - Calculate `mod_x` and `mod_y` using `num % x` and `num % y`.
     - Calculate the required `mod_x` and `mod_y` values that would make the pair beautiful.
     - Check if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary. If it does, add the corresponding frequency to `beautiful_count`.
     - Update the frequency dictionary with the current `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - After processing all elements in the array, append the `beautiful_count` to the `results` list.

6. **Returning Results:**
   - Finally, return the `results` list containing the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Modulo Calculations:**
   - The modulo calculations are correct and necessary to determine if a pair is beautiful.

2. **Frequency Dictionary Usage:**
   - The frequency dictionary is used correctly to count the occurrences of each `(mod_x, mod_y)` pair, which helps in identifying the beautiful pairs efficiently.

3. **Pair Validation:**
   - The logic for validating the beautiful pairs is correct. It checks if the required `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` pair exists in the frequency dictionary.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when a number itself forms a beautiful pair with another number (e.g., `a_i + a_j` and `a_i - a_j` both being zero).

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic for determining and counting beautiful pairs is correct. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles the required operations correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
