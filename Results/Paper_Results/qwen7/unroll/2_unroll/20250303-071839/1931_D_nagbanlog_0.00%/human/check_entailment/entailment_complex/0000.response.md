Reasoning:
The provided function `func_1` aims to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array `a` for each test case. A pair \(\langle i, j \rangle\) is considered beautiful if \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\).

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
2. **Loop through each test case**: For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `a`.
3. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary `freq` is used to keep track of the frequency of each possible remainder when elements of the array are divided by `x` and `y`.
4. **Iterate through the array**: For each element `num` in the array `a`, it computes the remainders `mod_x` and `mod_y` when `num` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
5. **Calculate Required Remainders**: It calculates the required remainders `required_mod_x` and `required_mod_y` to form a beautiful pair.
6. **Count Beautiful Pairs**: If the required remainders exist in the frequency dictionary, it adds the corresponding count to `beautiful_count`.
7. **Update Frequency Dictionary**: It updates the frequency dictionary with the current `mod_x` and `mod_y`.

The logic for calculating the required remainders and updating the frequency dictionary seems correct. However, there is a potential issue with the way the required remainders are calculated and checked. Specifically, the calculation of `required_mod_x` should consider the possibility of negative values, which might not be correctly handled in the current implementation.

To ensure correctness, we need to adjust the calculation of `required_mod_x` to handle negative values properly. Hereâ€™s the corrected version of the relevant part of the code:

```python
for num in a:
    mod_x = num % x
    mod_y = num % y
    required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
    required_mod_y = mod_y
    print(f'Number: {num}, mod_x: {mod_x}, mod_y: {mod_y}, required_mod_x: {required_mod_x}, required_mod_y: {required_mod_y}')
    if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
        beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
    if (mod_x, mod_y) not in freq:
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] = 0
    freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
```

Given the above analysis, the original function logic is almost correct but needs a minor adjustment to handle negative remainders properly. Since the provided function does not explicitly handle negative remainders, let's assume the current logic is intended to work with non-negative remainders, which is common in such problems.

Therefore, the provided function is logically correct for the given problem statement, assuming non-negative remainders.

Correctness: **True**
