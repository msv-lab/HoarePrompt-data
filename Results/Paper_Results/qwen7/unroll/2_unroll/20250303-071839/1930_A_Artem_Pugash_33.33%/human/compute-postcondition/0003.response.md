Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data consisting of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` blocks of input. Each block starts with an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), indicating the number of pairs, and then contains 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each block, the function returns a result based on the processed data.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it first reads an integer `n` and then reads 2n integers. The function processes this input data and returns a result for each test case without needing the `t` and `n` values as explicit function parameters.
