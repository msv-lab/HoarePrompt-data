Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numCases`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting Integers**: For each test case, the program reads `2n` integers, splits them into a list, and sorts the list in ascending order. Sorting ensures that when we take the minimum of each pair, we are always pairing the smallest available numbers together.
3. **Summing Minimum Values**: After sorting, the program iterates through the list in pairs, taking the minimum of each pair and adding it to the total sum (`suma`). By sorting and processing in pairs, the program ensures that the minimum values are added to the score, which maximizes the score according to the problem statement.
4. **Outputting Results**: Finally, the program prints the total sum for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
