Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the score. Specifically, the program simply pops the first two elements from the sorted list and adds their minimum value to the score, which does not guarantee the maximum possible score. For instance, consider the input:

```
3
4
2 1 4 3
```

The correct approach would be to always pair the smallest available numbers to maximize the score. However, the current implementation does not ensure this. A better approach would be to sort the numbers and then iteratively pair the smallest and largest remaining numbers until all numbers are used. This ensures that the sum of the minimum values is maximized.
