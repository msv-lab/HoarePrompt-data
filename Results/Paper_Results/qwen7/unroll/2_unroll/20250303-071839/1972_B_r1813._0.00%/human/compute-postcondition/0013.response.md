Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D". For each test case, it counts the number of "U" characters in the string s. If the count is odd, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. Finally, it prints each element in the results list, which consists of 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether the count of "U" in each string s is odd or even.**
