Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length n containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string from `sys.stdin.read`**.

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The new variable `data` is created and assigned the result of the split operation.
