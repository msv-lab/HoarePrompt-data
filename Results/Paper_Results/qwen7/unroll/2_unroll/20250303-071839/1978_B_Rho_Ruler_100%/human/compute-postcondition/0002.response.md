The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `low <= high`. Right before the loop, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low <= high` must be true. Since `low` is 0, `high` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `high` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are positive integers, `high` will always be a positive integer, ensuring that `low <= high` is true.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`max_profit` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b` (which is already a positive integer)**
