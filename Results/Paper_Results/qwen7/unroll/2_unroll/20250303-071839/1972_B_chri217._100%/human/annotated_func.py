#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.

    t = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
    cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())
        
        s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()
        
        cases.append((n, s))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` test cases, and `cases` is a list containing `t` tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` and a string `s`, where `n` is an integer read from standard input and `s` is a string read from standard input for each test case.
    return cases
    #The program returns a list called 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' and a string 's', where 'n' is an integer read from standard input and 's' is a string read from standard input for each of the 't' test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a specified number of test cases from standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of coins and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D" characters. It then constructs a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the integer `n` and the string `s`. Finally, it returns this list of tuples.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list of length 2, where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #'YES' if the count of 'U' in the string `case[1]` is even, otherwise 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `case` containing two elements: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of "U" and "D". It counts the number of "U" characters in the string `s`. If the count is even, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
