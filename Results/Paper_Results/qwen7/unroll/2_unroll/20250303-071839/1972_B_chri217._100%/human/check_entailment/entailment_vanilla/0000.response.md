### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(n, s)` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up (`ups`).
   - The function checks if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even. If it is even, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - According to the problem statement, the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins. The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob, ensuring her eventual victory. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by always leaving an even number of facing-up coins for her.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly identifies whether Alice or Bob will win based on the initial number of facing-up coins.
   - The solution does not account for the specific sequence of moves but rather focuses on the final state of the game, which is sufficient to determine the winner.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
