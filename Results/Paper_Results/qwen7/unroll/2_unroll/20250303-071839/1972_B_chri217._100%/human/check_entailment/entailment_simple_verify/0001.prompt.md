You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of only "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.

    return cases
    #The program returns a list called 'cases' which contains 't' tuples. Each tuple consists of an integer 'n' and a string 's', where 'n' is an integer read from standard input and 's' is a string read from standard input for each of the 't' test cases.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: case is a list of length 2, where the first element is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of coins, and the second element is a string s of length n containing only "U" and "D", representing the initial state of the coins (facing up or down).
def func_2(case):
    ups = sum(1 for c in case[1] if c == 'U')
    return 'YES' if ups % 2 else 'NO'
    #'YES' if the count of 'U' in the string `case[1]` is even, otherwise 'NO'




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the input and stores the test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains `(n, s)` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes a single test case as an argument.
   - It counts the number of coins that are facing up (`ups`).
   - The function checks if the count of facing-up coins (`ups`) is even. If it is even, it returns `'YES'`, indicating that Alice will win; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.

3. **Game Logic**:
   - According to the problem statement, the game ends when there are no more facing-up coins. The key observation here is that the parity (even or odd) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - If the number of facing-up coins is even, Alice can always make a move that leaves an odd number of facing-up coins for Bob, ensuring her eventual victory. Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is odd, Bob can force Alice into a losing position by always leaving an even number of facing-up coins for her.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The logic implemented in `func_2` correctly identifies whether Alice or Bob will win based on the initial number of facing-up coins.
   - The solution does not account for the specific sequence of moves but rather focuses on the final state of the game, which is sufficient to determine the winner.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game.
