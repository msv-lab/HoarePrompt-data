Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). The value of `s`, which was mentioned in the initial state but not used in the given code, is not affected.
