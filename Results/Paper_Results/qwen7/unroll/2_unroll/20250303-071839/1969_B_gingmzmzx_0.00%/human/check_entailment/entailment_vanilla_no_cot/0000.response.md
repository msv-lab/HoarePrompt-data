Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The input is expected to be a binary string, but the function converts it into a list of integers. This conversion is unnecessary and could lead to confusion, especially since the problem specifies that the input is a binary string.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic used to calculate the minimum cost is flawed. The function attempts to count the number of zeros and ones, but it does not correctly simulate the cyclic shifts needed to sort the string in non-descending order.

3. **Algorithm Mismatch**: The provided solution does not follow the correct approach to find the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The logic to determine the minimum cost involves identifying segments where a cyclic shift is necessary and calculating the cost accordingly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the boundaries between segments of 1s and 0s and calculate the cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        s = input().strip()
        n = len(s)
        ans = 0
        
        # Find the first occurrence of '1'
        start = 0
        while start < n and s[start] == '0':
            start += 1
        
        # If no '1' is found, the string is already sorted
        if start == n:
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Find the last occurrence of '0'
        end = n - 1
        while end >= 0 and s[end] == '1':
            end -= 1
        
        # Calculate the cost of shifting the segment between the first '1' and the last '0'
        ans += (end - start + 1)
        
        # Continue with the remaining part of the string
        while start < n:
            # Find the next segment of '0's
            next_start = start + 1
            while next_start < n and s[next_start] == '0':
                next_start += 1
            
            # If no more '0's are found, break
            if next_start == n:
                break
            
            # Find the next segment of '1's
            next_end = next_start
            while next_end < n and s[next_end] == '1':
                next_end += 1
            
            # Calculate the cost of shifting the segment between the current '0's and '1's
            ans += (next_end - next_start + 1)
            
            # Update the start to the end of the current segment
            start = next_end
        
        print(ans)

# Example usage
func_1()
```

This corrected function properly identifies the segments and calculates the minimum cost of cyclic shifts to sort the string.
