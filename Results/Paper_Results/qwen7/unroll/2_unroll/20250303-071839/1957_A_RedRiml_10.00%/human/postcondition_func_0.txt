The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer indicating the number of sticks and a list of stick lengths. It counts the number of unique stick lengths that appear at least three times across all test cases and prints this count for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the count of such unique stick lengths for each test case.
