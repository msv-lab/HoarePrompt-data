State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an input integer, `w` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `w` as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `w` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because `range(w)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `w-1`.
3. The variable `t` is not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `w`, which must be greater than 0.
