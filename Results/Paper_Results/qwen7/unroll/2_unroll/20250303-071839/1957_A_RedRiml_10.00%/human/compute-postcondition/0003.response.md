Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `w` is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, `shapes` is an integer representing the total number of unique integers in the input lists that appear at least three times across all iterations.

The loop processes `w` inputs. For each input, it reads an integer `ln` and a list of integers `palka`. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in `palka`, keeping track of unique integers that appear at least three times. The final count of such integers is printed for each input, and `shapes` accumulates these counts across all iterations.
