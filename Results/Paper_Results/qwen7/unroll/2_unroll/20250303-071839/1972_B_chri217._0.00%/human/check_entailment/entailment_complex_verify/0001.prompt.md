You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n coins on the table forming a circle, and each coin is either
facing up or facing down. Alice and Bob take turns to play the following game,
and Alice goes first.

In each operation, the player chooses a facing-up coin, removes the coin, and
flips the two coins that are adjacent to it. If (before the operation) there
are only two coins left, then one will be removed and the other won't be
flipped (as it would be flipped twice). If (before the operation) there is
only one coin left, no coins will be flipped. If (before the operation) there
are no facing-up coins, the player loses.

Decide who will win the game if they both play optimally. It can be proved
that the game will end in a finite number of operations, and one of them will
win.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of the coins.

A string s of length n follows on the second line of each test case,
containing only "U" and "D", representing that each coin is facing up or
facing down.

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if Alice will win the game, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    UUDUD
    
    5
    
    UDDUD
    
    2
    
    UU

Output

    YES
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, the game may go as follows.

  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "DDUU". 
  * Bob chooses the last coin and s becomes "UDD". 
  * Alice chooses the first coin and s becomes "UU". 
  * Bob chooses the first coin and s becomes "U". 
  * Alice chooses the only coin and s becomes empty. 
  * Bob can't choose any coin now, and he loses the game. 

It can be proved that Bob will always lose if they both play optimally.

- Program: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if num_up % 2 == 1:
        return 'YES'
    else:
        return 'NO'



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[1])
    s = data[2]
    print(func_1(s))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of length n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), consisting only of the characters "U" and "D", where "U" represents a coin facing up and "D" represents a coin facing down.
def func_1(s):
    num_up = s.count('U')
    if (num_up % 2 == 1) :
        return 'YES'
        #The program returns 'YES'
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters, representing coins facing up and down respectively. It counts the number of 'U' characters in the string. If the count of 'U' characters is odd, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it returns 'YES' if the count of 'U' characters is even, matching the count of 'D' characters.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the winner of the game based on the initial configuration of the coins.
   - Alice and Bob take turns removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins.
   - The game ends when there are no more facing-up coins, and the player who cannot make a move loses.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - Each test case consists of the number of coins `n` and a string `s` representing the initial configuration of the coins.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to determine the winner based on the number of facing-up coins (`'U'`).

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis:**
   - The function counts the number of facing-up coins using `s.count('U')`.
   - If the count of facing-up coins is odd, it returns `'YES'`, indicating Alice wins.
   - If the count of facing-up coins is even, it returns `'NO'`, indicating Bob wins.

4. **Game Logic Verification:**
   - The key insight is that the parity (odd or even) of the number of facing-up coins determines the winner.
   - This is because:
     - Removing a facing-up coin and flipping its adjacent coins changes the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
     - If the number of facing-up coins is odd at the start, Alice can always ensure it remains odd after her turn, forcing Bob to face an even number of facing-up coins eventually.
     - Conversely, if the number of facing-up coins is even at the start, Bob can ensure it remains even after his turn, forcing Alice to face an odd number of facing-up coins eventually.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where there are only one or two coins left appropriately.
   - For `n = 1`, no coins are flipped.
   - For `n = 2`, one coin is removed without flipping.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in `func_1(s)` correctly identifies the winner based on the parity of the number of facing-up coins.
   - The program reads and processes multiple test cases correctly.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the analysis above.
