Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each `a_i` < 2^31). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible count of unique integers that can be obtained by performing bitwise XOR operations between any two integers in the list. After processing all test cases, the function sets `times` to 0 and leaves `check` unchanged at 2147483647.**
