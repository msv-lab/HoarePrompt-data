You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n non-negative integers, and he wants to divide all of them into
several groups so that in any group, any pair of numbers does not have
matching bit values among bits from 1 -st to 31 -st bit (i.e., considering the
31 least significant bits of the binary representation).

For an integer k , let k_2(i) denote the i -th bit in its binary
representation (from right to left, indexing from 1). For example, if k=43 ,
since 43=101011_2 , then 43_2(1)=1 , 43_2(2)=1 , 43_2(3)=0 , 43_2(4)=1 ,
43_2(5)=0 , 43_2(6)=1 , 43_2(7)=0 , 43_2(8)=0, \dots, 43_2(31)=0 .

Formally, for any two numbers x and y in the same group, the condition x_2(i)
\neq y_2(i) must hold for all 1 \leq i < 32 .

What is the minimum number of groups Vlad needs to achieve his goal? Each
number must fall into exactly one group.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the total number of integers.

The second line of each test case contains n given integers a_1, \ldots, a_n
(0 \leq a_j < 2^{31} ).

The sum of n over all test cases in a test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of groups
required to satisfy the condition.

Note

In the first test case, any two numbers have the same last 31 bits, so we need
to place each number in its own group.

In the second test case, a_1=0000000000000000000000000000000_2 ,
a_2=1111111111111111111111111111111_2 so they can be placed in the same group
because a_1(i) \ne a_2(i) for each i between 1 and 31 , inclusive.

- Program:
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        dic = dict()
        ans = n
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if s in dic:
                dic[s] -= 1
                ans -= 1
                if dic[s] == 0:
                    del dic[s]
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i] += 1
            else:
                dic[i] = 1
            print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each `a_i` < 2^31). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum possible count of unique integers that can be obtained by performing bitwise XOR operations between any two integers in the list. After processing all test cases, the function sets `times` to 0 and leaves `check` unchanged at 2147483647.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of groups required. The logic in the program uses bitwise XOR with `check` (which is `2**31 - 1`, or `11111111111111111111111111111111` in binary) to flip all bits of the numbers. However, this approach does not ensure that any two numbers in the same group will differ in all 31 bits. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
1 4 3 4
```
The expected output is `4`, because each number must be in its own group since flipping all bits using `check` does not guarantee that any two numbers will differ in all 31 bits.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` because it assumes that the numbers can be grouped together if they have different bits after the XOR operation, which is not always true. Specifically, for the numbers `1`, `4`, and `3`, the XOR with `check` results in `1`, `4`, and `3` respectively, but these numbers still do not satisfy the condition of differing in all 31 bits.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirement of ensuring that any two numbers in the same group will differ in all 31 bits, making it incorrect.
