You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are non-negative and less than 2^{31}. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    times = int(input())
    check = 2 ** 31 - 1
    for _ in range(times):
        n = int(input())
        
        data = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        dic = dict()
        
        ans = n
        
        check = 2 ** 31 - 1
        
        for i in data:
            s = i ^ check
            if s in dic:
                dic[s] -= 1
                ans -= 1
                if dic[s] == 0:
                    del dic[s]
            elif i in dic:
                dic[i] += 1
            else:
                dic[i] = 1
            print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: `check` is 2147483647; `times` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `times` number of times. After each iteration of the loop, `times` is decremented by 1. Since `times` starts as a positive integer (1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, after all iterations, `times` will be 0. The value of `check` remains unchanged at 2147483647 because it is not modified within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and a list of `n` non-negative integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and each `a_i` < 2^31). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
