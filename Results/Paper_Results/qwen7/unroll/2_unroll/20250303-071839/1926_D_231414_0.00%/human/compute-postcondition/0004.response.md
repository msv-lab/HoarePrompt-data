Output State: `check` is 2147483647; `times` is 0.

Explanation: The loop runs `times` number of times. After each iteration of the loop, `times` is decremented by 1. Since `times` starts as a positive integer (1 ≤ `times` ≤ 10^4) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, after all iterations, `times` will be 0. The value of `check` remains unchanged at 2147483647 because it is not modified within the loop.
