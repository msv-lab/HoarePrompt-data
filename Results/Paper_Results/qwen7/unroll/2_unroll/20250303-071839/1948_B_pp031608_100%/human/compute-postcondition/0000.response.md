Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is now assigned the value of the input integer within the specified range.
