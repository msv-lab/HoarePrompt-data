Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through multiple lines. It first reads an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and then reads n integers (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). The function then performs some operation based on these inputs and returns a result.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes a series of test cases where each test case starts with an integer n indicating the number of subsequent integers to read. These integers are then processed according to some defined logic, though the specific logic is not detailed here.
