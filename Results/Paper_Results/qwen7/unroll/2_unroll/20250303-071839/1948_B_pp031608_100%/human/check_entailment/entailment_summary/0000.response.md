Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The problem asks to transform the array into a sorted one by repeatedly splitting any element that is at least 10 into its individual digits and inserting those digits back into the array. However, the program incorrectly attempts to sort the array by swapping at most one pair of adjacent elements, which is not the intended operation.

The program should check if it's possible to make the array sorted by repeatedly applying the digit-splitting operation, but instead, it tries to determine if the array can be sorted with a single adjacent swap. This is why the program's logic is fundamentally flawed and does not match the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
