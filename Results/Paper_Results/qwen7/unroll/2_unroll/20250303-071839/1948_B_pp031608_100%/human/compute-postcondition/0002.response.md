Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, n is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and for each iteration of the loop, an array `arr` is processed to check if it can be sorted by swapping at most one pair of adjacent elements. The final output is either 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether such a swap can sort the array.
