Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values of `x` where `a = 3` (i.e., `k â‰  x`).
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to represent the upper and lower bounds of `k`, respectively. `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000007`), and `bx` is initialized to `-1`.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a = 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a = 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a = 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no feasible values for `k`, and the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of feasible values for `k` by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are stored in list `r` and printed at the end.

### Verification

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `ax` and `bx` cross each other, resulting in an empty feasible range.

2. **Set Handling:**
   - The use of a set `cx` ensures that duplicate values are not counted multiple times, which is necessary since no two constraints are the same.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the number of feasible values is correct. It correctly counts the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that do not belong to the set `cx`.

4. **Guarantees:**
   - The problem guarantees that there will always be at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `bx` and `ax` will always be defined and valid.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles all specified cases and guarantees, and the code is logically sound.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
