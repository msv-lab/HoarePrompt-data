Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the code does not affect the other variables, the only change is that `t` now holds the input value. Similarly, the variable `n` is introduced and will be assigned a value in the next line of code, which is not provided here. Therefore, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, as per the initial state description.
