You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) and \( n \), along with constraints defined by integers \( a \) and \( x \). For each test case, it calculates a value based on the maximum and minimum values of \( x \) for types 1 and 2, and the count of \( x \) values in type 3 that fall within a specific range. If the maximum value of type 1 constraints is greater than or equal to the minimum value of type 2 constraints, it appends 0 to the result list. Otherwise, it calculates the difference between the minimum and maximum values of type 2 constraints, subtracts the count of overlapping \( x \) values in type 3, and appends this value to the result list. Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values of `x` where `a = 3` (i.e., `k ≠ x`).
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to represent the upper and lower bounds of `k`, respectively. `ax` is initialized to a large value (`1000000007`), and `bx` is initialized to `-1`.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a = 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a = 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a = 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than or equal to `ax`. If so, it means there are no feasible values for `k`, and the result is `0`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of feasible values for `k` by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` that fall within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]`.

5. **Output:**
   - The results for each test case are stored in list `r` and printed at the end.

### Verification

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `ax` and `bx` cross each other, resulting in an empty feasible range.

2. **Set Handling:**
   - The use of a set `cx` ensures that duplicate values are not counted multiple times, which is necessary since no two constraints are the same.

3. **Range Calculation:**
   - The calculation of the number of feasible values is correct. It correctly counts the number of integers in the range `[bx, ax]` that do not belong to the set `cx`.

4. **Guarantees:**
   - The problem guarantees that there will always be at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `bx` and `ax` will always be defined and valid.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It handles all specified cases and guarantees, and the code is logically sound.
