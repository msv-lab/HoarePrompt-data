Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a result based on a series of constraints and relationships defined within the test cases. For each test case, it checks if the integer \( t \) is between 1 and 500, and if the integer \( n \) is between 2 and 100. It also verifies that \( a \) is either 1, 2, or 3, and \( x \) is between 1 and \( 10^9 \). Additionally, it ensures that there is at least one constraint of type 1, at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct within each test case.**
