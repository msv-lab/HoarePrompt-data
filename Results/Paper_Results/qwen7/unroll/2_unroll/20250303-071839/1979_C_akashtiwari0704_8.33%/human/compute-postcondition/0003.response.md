Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each line, there will be either a `-1` printed if the condition `sumo >= prod` is met, or a sequence of integers separated by spaces representing the transformed list `a` after applying the operations inside the loop. Each line will follow the format of the output produced within the loop's body.
