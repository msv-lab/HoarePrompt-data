Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the outer loop. For each line, there will be either a `-1` printed if the condition `sumo >= prod` is met, or a sequence of integers separated by spaces representing the transformed list `a` where each element is calculated as `prod // a[i]`, followed by the sum `sumo` of these elements. The initial integer `t` determines how many such lines will be printed.
