Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by `t` lines of input, each containing an integer `bets`. It then reads `bets` integers into a list `a`. The function calculates the product of all integers in `a` and divides each element in `a` by this product, summing these divisions. If the sum is greater than or equal to the product, it prints `-1`; otherwise, it prints the modified list `a` as space-separated integers. This process is repeated for each test case, producing a series of outputs corresponding to each test case.**
