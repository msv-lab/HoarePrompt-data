Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `bets` and the multipliers `a`.

2. **Calculating Total Multiplier Product:**
   - The program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`).
   - This is done using a loop that multiplies each element in the list `a`.

3. **Calculating Individual Bets:**
   - For each outcome, the program calculates the bet required to ensure that the total bet is less than the reward.
   - Specifically, it sets `a[i]` to `prod // a[i]`, which means the bet for the i-th outcome is the product of all multipliers divided by the i-th multiplier.
   - It then adds up these individual bets to get `sumo`.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - If the total bet `sumo` is greater than or equal to the product `prod`, the program prints `-1` indicating no feasible distribution.
   - Otherwise, it constructs and prints the list of bets.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Product Calculation:**
   - The product `prod` is correctly calculated as the multiplication of all multipliers.

2. **Bet Calculation:**
   - The bet calculation `a[i] = prod // a[i]` ensures that if the i-th outcome wins, the reward is `a[i] * a[i]`, which is `prod`.
   - This setup ensures that the total bet is less than the reward for any winning outcome.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The sum `sumo` is correctly calculated as the sum of all individual bets.

4. **Feasibility Check:**
   - The check `if sumo >= prod:` is correct. If the sum of bets is greater than or equal to the product, it means the conditions cannot be met, and thus `-1` is printed.

5. **Output Construction:**
   - The construction of the answer string `ans` is correct, and it prints the bets separated by spaces.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the reward for any winning outcome. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
