Reasoning:
1. The problem requires distributing coins such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
2. The provided program attempts to solve this by calculating the product of all multipliers (`k_i`) and then dividing each multiplier by this product. However, this approach is flawed because:
   - Dividing each multiplier by the product of all multipliers does not necessarily result in a distribution where the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
   - The logic to check if the sum of these divided values is greater than or equal to the product and printing `-1` if so is incorrect. Instead, we need to ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome.
3. The program should instead calculate the minimum possible bet for each outcome that satisfies the condition and ensure the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

Given the flaws in the provided program's logic, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
