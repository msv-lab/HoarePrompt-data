Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program calculates the product of all multipliers (`prod`) and then divides this product by each multiplier to determine the bets. However, this approach does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
5 5 5
```

The program will calculate `prod` as `5 * 5 * 5 = 125`. Then it will set the bets as `125 // 5 = 25` for each outcome. The total amount of coins bet is `25 + 25 + 25 = 75`, but for the first outcome, the player would receive back `5 * 25 = 125` coins, which is not strictly greater than 75. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the condition that the total amount of coins bet must be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Thus, the program is incorrect.
