State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4, T is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `T` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
2. The loop condition is `range(t)`, which means the loop will run from `T = 0` to `T < t`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. The value of `t` determines how many times the loop will run, but the initial state of `T` is always 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is within the given range (greater than 0 and less than or equal to \(10^4\)), and `T` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.
