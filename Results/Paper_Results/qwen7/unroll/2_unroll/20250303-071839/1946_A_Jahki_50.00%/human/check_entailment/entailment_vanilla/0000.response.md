Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `num`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `num2` and the array itself as a string `case`.

2. **Handling Large Arrays:**
   - If `num2` exceeds 10000, the program prints `1` and `16668` and breaks. This condition seems unnecessary and might not align with the problem constraints since the maximum `num2` is `10^5`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - Convert the string `case` into a list of integers `a`.
   - Sort the list `a` to get `b`.
   - Determine the median index `ma` based on whether `num2` is even or odd.
   - Initialize the operation count `op` to 0.
   - Increment elements starting from the median index until the new median is greater than the old median.
   - Print the number of operations `op`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Unnecessary Condition:**
   - The condition `if num2 > 10000:` is unnecessary and can be removed. The problem guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`, so no array will have more than `10^5` elements.

2. **Incrementing Elements:**
   - The program increments elements starting from the median index until the new median is greater than the old median. However, this approach is inefficient and does not guarantee the minimum number of operations. Instead, we should directly compute how many operations are needed to make the current median the smallest possible value that is greater than the current median.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median calculation is correct but the approach to increment elements is flawed. We need to calculate the difference between the current median and the next smallest element that can become the new median after the minimum number of operations.

### Correct Approach:

To find the minimum number of operations, we need to:
1. Find the current median.
2. Identify the smallest element that can be incremented to make it the new median.
3. Calculate the number of operations needed to reach this new median.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num = int(input())
    for i in range(num):
        num2 = int(input())
        case = input()
        a = [int(i) for i in case.split()]
        b = sorted(a)
        
        if num2 % 2 == 0:
            ma = int(num2 / 2) - 1
        else:
            ma = int(num2 / 2)
        
        current_median = b[ma]
        next_smaller = b[ma] + 1
        
        # Find the smallest element that can be incremented to become the new median
        for j in range(ma, -1, -1):
            if b[j] < next_smaller:
                break
        
        # Calculate the number of operations needed
        op = (next_smaller - current_median) * (ma - j + 1)
        
        print(op)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The provided program has logical flaws in its approach to finding the minimum number of operations. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
