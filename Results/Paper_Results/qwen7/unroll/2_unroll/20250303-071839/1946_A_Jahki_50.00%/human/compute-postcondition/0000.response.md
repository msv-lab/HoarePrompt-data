Output State: **`num` is an input integer representing the number of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (length of the array `a`) and a list `a` of `n` integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`num`). For each test case, the user is expected to provide an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. However, the code itself does not modify any variables except for reading the first integer (`num`). Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, except that `num` now holds the value of the input integer.
