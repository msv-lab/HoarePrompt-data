Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it first checks if the length of the array `a` (denoted by `num2`) is greater than 10000. If so, it prints "1" followed by "16668" and stops further processing. Otherwise, it calculates the median of the sorted array `a`, then increments elements until the new median is strictly greater than the original median, counting the number of operations required. Finally, it prints the total number of operations needed for each valid test case.**
