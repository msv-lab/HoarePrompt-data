Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, if the value of `num2` is greater than 10000, it will print "1" followed by "16668" and then stop. Otherwise, it will print an integer `op`, which represents the number of operations needed to make the median of the sorted list `b` strictly greater than the original median. Each test case's output will be formatted as follows:

- If `num2` is greater than 10000, the output will be two lines per test case: "1" followed by "16668".
- If `num2` is less than or equal to 10000, the output will be a single line per test case containing the integer `op`.
