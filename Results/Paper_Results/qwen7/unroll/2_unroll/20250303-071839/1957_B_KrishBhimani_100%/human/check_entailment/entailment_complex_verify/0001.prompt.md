You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

        if n == 1:
            print(k)
        else:
            arr = []
            k0 = k
            i = 0
            ans = []
            temp = 1
            while True:
                if temp * 2 < k:
                    temp *= 2
                    i += 1
                else:
                    break
            ans.append((1 << i) - 1)
            ans.append(k - sum(ans))
            ans += [0] * (n - len(ans))

    #State: Output State: t test cases are processed, and for each test case, two numbers are printed. The first number is a power of 2 (or 0 if n is 1), and the second number is the remaining value after subtracting the first number from k. If n is greater than 2, the remaining positions in the list are filled with 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). If \( n \) is 1, it prints \( k \). Otherwise, it calculates two numbers: a power of 2 (or 0 if \( n \) is 1) and the remaining value after subtracting this power of 2 from \( k \). It then fills the rest of the list with zeros up to length \( n \) and prints these values. The function implicitly takes the number of test cases \( t \) as input through user input, and outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case:**
   - If `n == 1`, the program prints `k` directly. This is correct because the only element must be `k` itself to satisfy both conditions.

3. **Multiple Elements Case:**
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs an array `ans` with `n` elements.
   - It initializes `k0` as `k` and sets `i` to 0.
   - It finds the highest power of 2 less than `k` and appends `(1 << i) - 1` to `ans`. This value is the largest possible integer with all bits set to 1 up to the current highest power of 2.
   - It then subtracts this value from `k` and appends the result to `ans`.
   - It fills the rest of the array with zeros to make the total length `n`.

4. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The sum of the elements in `ans` should equal `k`.
   - The bitwise OR of the elements in `ans` should maximize the number of 1s in its binary representation.

### Testing the Logic:

- **Single Element Case:**
  - For `n = 1` and `k = 5`, the program prints `5`, which is correct.

- **Multiple Elements Case:**
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 3`:
    - The program will append `1` (which is `1 << 0 - 1`) and `2` (which is `3 - 1`), resulting in `[1, 2]`.
    - The sum is `1 + 2 = 3`, and the bitwise OR is `1 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which is correct.
  - For `n = 2` and `k = 5`:
    - The program will append `3` (which is `1 << 1 - 1`) and `2` (which is `5 - 3`), resulting in `[3, 2]`.
    - The sum is `3 + 2 = 5`, and the bitwise OR is `3 | 2 = 3` (binary `11`), which is correct.
  - For `n = 6` and `k = 51`:
    - The program will append `31` (which is `1 << 4 - 1`), `1` (which is `51 - 31`), `1` (which is `0`), `32` (which is `0`), `2` (which is `0`), and `12` (which is `0`), resulting in `[31, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12]`.
    - The sum is `31 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 89`, but the program should ensure the sum is `51`. This suggests a potential issue with the logic for constructing the array.

### Conclusion:

The program fails to correctly handle the case where `n > 1` and `k` is not a simple sum of powers of 2. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array does not always produce the correct sequence that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.
