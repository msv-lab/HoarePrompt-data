Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the condition `n if n - k <= 1 else 1` for each test case. For each test case, if the value of `n - k` is less than or equal to 1, the number `n` will be printed; otherwise, the number `1` will be printed. The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input. Each line will contain either the value of `n` or `1`, depending on the condition evaluated for that specific test case.
