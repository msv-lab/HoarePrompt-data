Reasoning:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by sorting the first half and the second half of the array separately and then constructing the required lists `ans1` and `ans2` based on the value of `k`. However, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

1. **Handling of Unique Elements**: The code does not ensure that the XOR of `ans1` and `ans2` will be equal. Specifically, the code does not handle the XOR operation correctly and does not guarantee that the elements chosen will result in the same XOR value for both lists.

2. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, it does not ensure that the elements selected for `ans1` and `ans2` will have the same XOR value. The current approach might lead to incorrect results if the elements are not chosen appropriately.

3. **Sorting and Selection Logic**: The logic for selecting elements from the sorted halves is flawed. It does not ensure that the XOR of the selected elements will be the same for both lists. The current implementation does not account for the requirement that the XOR of the elements in `ans1` must equal the XOR of the elements in `ans2`.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
