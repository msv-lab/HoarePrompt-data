### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of initial arrays \(a\) of size \(n\) consisting of only 1 and -1, such that the sorted prefix sum array \(p\) matches the given sorted prefix sum array after the prefix sums are computed and sorted.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to construct the prefix sums array \(a\) that results in the given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
   - The function initializes a DP array `dp` of length \(2n + 1\) with zeros.
   - It iteratively updates the `dp` array based on the previous values, ensuring each element is updated modulo `MOD`.
   - The final result is derived from the `dp` array using the last element of the sorted prefix sum array \(p\).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, the size of the hidden array `n`, and the sorted prefix sum array `p` for each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1(n, p)` to get the result and stores it in a list `results`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the implementation seems to handle all cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. All functions work together to process the input and produce the expected output.

### Correctness:
**True**
