The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), and `p`, a list of `n` integers sorted in non-decreasing order with each element's absolute value not exceeding `n`. It initializes a list `dp` of length `2 * n + 1` with zeros. The function then iteratively updates `dp` based on its previous values, ensuring that each element in `dp` is updated modulo some `MOD`. After completing these updates, the function calculates `final_sum` as the sum of the last element of `p` and `n`, and returns the value at `dp[final_sum]`.
