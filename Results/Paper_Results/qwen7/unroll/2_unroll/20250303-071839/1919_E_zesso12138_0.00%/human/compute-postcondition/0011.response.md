Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n`, a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`; and `p`, a list of `n` integers where |p_i| <= n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function does not return anything as the output description does not specify a return value.**
