Output State: **`index` is 0, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using spaces.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `p`, or `data`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
