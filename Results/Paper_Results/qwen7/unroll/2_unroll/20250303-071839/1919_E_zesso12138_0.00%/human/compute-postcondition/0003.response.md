Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `data[index]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000 representing the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of n integers where |p_i| <= n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using spaces.**

The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value from `data` at index `0` (since `index` is initially 0) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, `index` is incremented to `1` to point to the next element in the list `data`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `data` remain unchanged from their initial state.
