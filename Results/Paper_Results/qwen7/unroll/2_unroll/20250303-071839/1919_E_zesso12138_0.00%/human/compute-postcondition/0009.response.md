Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for res in results:`. The only variable mentioned here is `res`, which is an element from the `results` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `res`**: Since the loop is iterating over `results`, `res` will take on each value in the `results` list one by one. However, the initial state of `res` before the loop starts is not specified directly. Instead, we need to consider the state of `results`.

3. **Understand the contents of `results`**: The `results` list is populated by calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, where `n` and `p` are derived from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and having a length of `n`.

4. **Initial state of `results`**: For the loop to start, `results` must contain at least one element. This means that `func_1(n, p)` must have been called at least once, and `results` must have at least one entry.

5. **Initial state of `index` and `t`**: The value of `index` is given as `2 + 2 * t`, where `t` is the number of iterations. This means that for the first iteration, `t = 0` and `index = 2`. For subsequent iterations, `t` increases by 1, and `index` changes accordingly.

6. **Initial state of `n` and `p`**: These values are derived from the slice of `data` starting at `index` and having a length of `n`. Therefore, `n` and `p` must be defined for the first iteration, and their values should be consistent with the slice of `data`.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the presence of at least one element in the `results` list.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`results` must contain at least one element**
