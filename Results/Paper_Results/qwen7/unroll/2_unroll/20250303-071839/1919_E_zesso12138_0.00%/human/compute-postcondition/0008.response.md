Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for res in results:`. The only object here is `res`, which is an element of the `results` list.

2. **Determine the initial state of `res`**: Since `res` is taken from the `results` list, the initial value of `res` will be the first element of the `results` list.

3. **Understand the contents of `results`**: The `results` list contains the results of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Determine the initial state of `results`**: For the loop to execute, `results` must have at least one element. Therefore, we need to ensure that `results` is not empty.

5. **Consider the initial values of `index` and `t`**: The initial value of `index` is given as `2 + 2 * t`, where `t` is the number of iterations. However, since we are starting before the loop, `t` is 0 (no iterations have occurred yet), so `index` is `2 + 2 * 0 = 2`.

6. **Determine the initial state of `n` and `p`**: The values of `n` and `p` depend on the data at `data[index:index + n]`. Since `index` is 2, the initial state of `n` and `p` is determined by the first call to `func_1` with `n` and `p` derived from `data[2:2+n]`.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should ensure that `results` is not empty. Here is the final state:

**State: `results` must have at least one element, index is 2, t is 0**
