Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads a string of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. It then counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in the string and prints 'A' if there are more 'A's, and 'B' if there are more 'B's. The program handles all the given constraints and examples correctly.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function accurately processes each test case and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
