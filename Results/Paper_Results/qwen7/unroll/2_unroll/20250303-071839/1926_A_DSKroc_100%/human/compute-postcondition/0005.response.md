Functionality: **The function processes a series of input strings, each of length 5 consisting of 'A' and 'B'. For each string, it counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B'. If the count of 'A's is greater, it prints 'A'; otherwise, it prints 'B'. The function reads the number of such strings to process from the input and performs this operation for each string. After processing all strings, it outputs the result for each one.**
