Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`. It handles the special case where `m == 1` correctly by printing 'yes' and skipping further checks.

2. **Initial Comparisons**: The function compares the first two screenshots (`l1` and `l2`) to check if they can be made identical by removing the author of the screenshot. This is done correctly by filtering out the author's position and comparing the remaining elements.

3. **Index Tracking**: The function tracks the indices where the author's position differs between the two lists (`idx1` and `idx2`). It correctly identifies the positions where the author's position should be inserted to make the lists identical.

4. **Insertion Logic**: The function inserts the author's position at the identified indices in either `l1` or `l2` to try to make the lists identical. This logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that the lists are modified appropriately.

5. **Additional Checks**: For cases where more than two screenshots are provided, the function correctly checks if the subsequent screenshots can be made identical by inserting the author's position at the appropriate index. This is done by comparing the filtered lists with the current list after insertion.

6. **Final Validation**: The function performs a final validation to ensure that all subsequent screenshots can be made identical to the modified list. If any screenshot fails this validation, the function prints 'no'. Otherwise, it prints 'yes'.

Given the above points, the function appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly, including handling edge cases and performing the necessary checks to determine if the screenshots can be made identical.

Correctness: **True**
