Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each test case within t, it accepts two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. Additionally, it accepts a list a containing n integers, each between 1 and 10^12, representing the number of cards of type i initially. Based on these inputs, the function processes each test case and returns a result for each, though the specific result is not detailed here.**
