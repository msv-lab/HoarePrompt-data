You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program: 
import random

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
import random

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        s2 = ''.join(random.sample(s, len(s)))
        
        if s != s2:
            print('Yes')
            print(s2)
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where for each test case, either 'Yes' followed by a randomly permuted version of the input string `s`, or 'No' will be printed. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases provided as input. Each line either confirms that the string was not a palindrome (by printing 'Yes' and a random permutation) or denies it (by printing 'No').
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it generates a random permutation of the string `s` and checks if the original string is different from the permutation. If they are different, it prints 'Yes' followed by the random permutation; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the string `s`.

2. **Generating a Rearranged String**:
   - For each string `s`, the program generates a new string `s2` by shuffling the characters of `s` using `random.sample(s, len(s))`.
   - This method ensures that `s2` is a permutation of `s`.

3. **Checking for Non-Equality**:
   - The program checks if `s` is not equal to `s2` using the condition `if s != s2:`.
   - If they are not equal, it prints "Yes" followed by `s2`.
   - If they are equal, it prints "No".

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program outputs "Yes" or "No" in the required format.
   - It also outputs the rearranged string `s2` if `s` and `s2` are different.

### Edge Cases:
- **Strings with All Characters the Same**: 
  - For strings like `"aaaaa"` or `"hhhhhhh"`, the shuffled string `s2` will always be the same as `s`. In such cases, the program correctly outputs "No".
- **Strings with Unique Characters**:
  - For strings like `"codeforces"`, the shuffled string `s2` will likely be different from `s`, and the program correctly outputs "Yes" followed by `s2`.
- **Strings with Few Characters**:
  - For very short strings like `"co"`, `"d"`, the program still works correctly by generating a different permutation if possible.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to check if a rearranged string `s2` can be formed from `s` that is not equal to `s`. It handles all edge cases appropriately and follows the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
