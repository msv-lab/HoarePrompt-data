Output State: **The program returns a string that is the concatenation of the substring of 's' from index 0 to k (inclusive) repeated n times.**

This means that the program will take the string `s` which contains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw', extract a substring of length `k` starting from the beginning, and then repeat this substring `n` times to form the final output string.
