Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 676, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are now assigned the values of the integers entered by the user, separated by a space. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 676.
