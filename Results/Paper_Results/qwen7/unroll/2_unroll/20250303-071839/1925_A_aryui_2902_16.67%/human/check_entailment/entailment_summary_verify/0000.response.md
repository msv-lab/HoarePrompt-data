### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary in detail.

1. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1()` takes no arguments and always returns the same string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw'` sliced from index 0 to `k` and repeated `n` times.
   - This means the function always outputs a string of length `nk` composed of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, repeated `n` times.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()` and prints the result.
   - `func_1()` does not use the values of `n` and `k` passed from the main loop, which means it always returns the same string regardless of the input.

3. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the test case `n=1` and `k=2`, the expected output should be a string that contains all possible subsequences of length 1 using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, i.e., `"ab"`.
   - However, `func_1()` returns `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"[:2] * 1 = "ab"`, which is correct for this specific case.
   - For the test case `n=2` and `k=1`, the expected output should be a string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 1 lowercase English alphabet, i.e., `"aa"`.
   - `func_1()` returns `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"[:1] * 2 = "aa"`, which is also correct for this specific case.
   - For the test case `n=2` and `k=3`, the expected output should be a string that contains all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, i.e., `"aa"`, `"ab"`, `"ac"`, `"ba"`, `"bb"`, `"bc"`, `"ca"`, `"cb"`, `"cc"`.
   - `func_1()` returns `"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvw"[:3] * 2 = "abcabc"`, which does not contain all possible subsequences of length 2 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program does not correctly generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. It always returns a fixed string based on the first `k` lowercase English alphabets, repeated `n` times.
   - The function summary is misleading because it does not reflect the actual behavior of the function, which is to return a fixed string.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
