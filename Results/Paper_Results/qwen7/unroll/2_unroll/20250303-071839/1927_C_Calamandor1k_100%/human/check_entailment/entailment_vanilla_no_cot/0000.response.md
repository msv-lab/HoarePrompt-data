Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly \(\frac{k}{2}\) elements from both arrays such that every integer from 1 to \(k\) is included among the chosen elements. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Extracting Data**: For each test case, it extracts the lengths of arrays \(a\) and \(b\), and the value of \(k\). It also reads the elements of arrays \(a\) and \(b\).
3. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It creates sets of unique elements from arrays \(a\) and \(b\) that are less than or equal to \(k\).
   - It identifies elements that are unique to \(a\) and \(b\) and those that are common to both.
   - It checks if the number of unique elements in either \(a\) or \(b\) exceeds \(\frac{k}{2}\). If so, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - It calculates the total number of distinct elements across both arrays. If this total is less than \(k\), it returns 'NO'.
   - If all checks pass, it returns 'YES'.

The logic ensures that the conditions specified in the problem statement are met, making the program correct for the given task.
