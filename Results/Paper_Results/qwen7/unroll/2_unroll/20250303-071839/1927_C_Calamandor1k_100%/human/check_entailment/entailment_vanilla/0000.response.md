Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if it's possible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of the two arrays such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It iterates through each test case, storing the necessary information (lengths of arrays, \( k \), and the arrays themselves).
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case:
     - It creates sets of unique elements from both arrays.
     - It filters out elements greater than \( k \) from these sets.
     - It categorizes elements into those exclusive to array \( a \), those exclusive to array \( b \), and those present in both.
     - It checks if the number of elements exclusive to either array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it immediately returns 'NO'.
     - It calculates the total number of distinct elements across both arrays and checks if this total is at least \( k \). If not, it returns 'NO'.
     - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the upper limit on the sum of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to choose the required elements is sound.
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case as specified.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
