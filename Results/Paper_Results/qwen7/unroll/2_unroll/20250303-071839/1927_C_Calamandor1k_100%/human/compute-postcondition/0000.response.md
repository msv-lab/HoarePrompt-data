Output State: **`results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, and the conditions and values of the initial state for `t`, `cases`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `results` is now an empty list.
