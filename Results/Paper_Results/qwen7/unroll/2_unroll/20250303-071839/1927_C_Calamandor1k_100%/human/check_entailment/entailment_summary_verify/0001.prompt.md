You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n integers, an array b of m integers, and an even number k
.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to choose exactly \frac{k}{2}
elements from both arrays in such a way that among the chosen elements, every
integer from 1 to k is included.

For example:

  * If a=[2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 4, 10, 5] , k=6 , then it is possible to choose elements with values 2, 3, 6 from array a and elements with values 1, 4, 5 from array b . In this case, all numbers from 1 to k=6 will be included among the chosen elements.
  * If a=[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 5] , b=[1, 3, 8, 10, 3] , k=6 , then it is not possible to choose elements in the required way. 

Note that you are not required to find a way to choose the elements — your
program should only check whether it is possible to choose the elements in the
required way.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n, m \le 2\cdot10^5 , 2 \le k \le 2 \cdot \min(n, m) , k is even) — the length
of array a , the length of array b , and the number of elements to be chosen,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_j \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test
does not exceed 4 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to choose \frac{k}{2} numbers from
each array in such a way that among the chosen elements, every integer from 1
to k is included. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 2 , 3 , and 6 from array a and elements equal to 1 , 4 , and 5 from array b
. Thus, all numbers from 1 to k=6 are included among the chosen elements.

In the second test case of the example, it can be shown that it is not
possible to choose exactly three elements from each array in the required way.

In the third test case of the example, it is possible to choose elements equal
to 1 and 3 from array a and elements equal to 2 and 4 from array b . Thus, all
numbers from 1 to k=4 are included among the chosen elements.

- Program:
t = int(input())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cases.append((n, m, k, a, b))
results = func_1(t, cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, cases):
    results = []
    for (n, m, k, a, b) in cases:
        unique_a = set(a)
        unique_b = set(b)
        relevant_a = {x for x in unique_a if x <= k}
        relevant_b = {x for x in unique_b if x <= k}
        only_a = relevant_a - relevant_b
        only_b = relevant_b - relevant_a
        both = relevant_a & relevant_b
        if len(only_a) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        if len(only_b) > k // 2:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        total_distinct = len(only_a) + len(only_b) + len(both)
        if total_distinct < k:
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        results.append('YES')
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains five elements: `n`, `m`, and `k` (all integers), and two lists `a` and `b`. For each tuple in `cases`, the function checks specific conditions involving sets derived from `a` and `b`. If these conditions are met, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns the results list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each tuple in `cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to determine if it's possible to choose exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from each of the two arrays such that all integers from 1 to \( k \) are included among the chosen elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It iterates through each test case, storing the necessary information (lengths of arrays, \( k \), and the arrays themselves).
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case:
     - It creates sets of unique elements from both arrays.
     - It filters out elements greater than \( k \) from these sets.
     - It categorizes elements into those exclusive to array \( a \), those exclusive to array \( b \), and those present in both.
     - It checks if the number of elements exclusive to either array exceeds \( \frac{k}{2} \). If so, it immediately returns 'NO'.
     - It calculates the total number of distinct elements across both arrays and checks if this total is at least \( k \). If not, it returns 'NO'.
     - If all conditions are met, it returns 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the upper limit on the sum of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The logic for determining if it's possible to choose the required elements is sound.
   - The program outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case as specified.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the problem statement.
