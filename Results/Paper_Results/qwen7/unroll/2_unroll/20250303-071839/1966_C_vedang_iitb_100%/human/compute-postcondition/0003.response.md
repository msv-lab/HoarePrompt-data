Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing either "Alice" or "Bob". For each test case (tc) provided in the input, the program determines whether "Alice" or "Bob" wins based on the conditions specified in the loop. Specifically, it checks if the smallest missing positive integer (`mexsize`) is greater than the maximum value in the list (`maxsize`). If `mexsize` is greater, it prints "Alice" if `mexsize` is even, and "Bob" if `mexsize` is odd. If `mexsize` is not greater, it prints "Alice" if `mexsize` is odd, and "Bob" if `mexsize` is even.
