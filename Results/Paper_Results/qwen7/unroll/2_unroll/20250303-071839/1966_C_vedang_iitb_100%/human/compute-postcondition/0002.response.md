Output State: The output state consists of a series of strings printed by the loop. For each iteration, if `mexsize` (the smallest missing positive integer) is greater than `maxsize` (the maximum value in the list `a`), the output is either "Alice" or "Bob" depending on whether `mexsize` is even or odd. Otherwise, the output is "Alice" if `mexsize` is odd and "Bob" if `mexsize` is even.
