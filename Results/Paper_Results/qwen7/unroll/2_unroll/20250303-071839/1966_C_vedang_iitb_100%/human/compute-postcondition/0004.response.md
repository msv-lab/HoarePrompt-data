Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, the function returns information about the distribution of stones across the piles based on the given inputs.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value details are not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
