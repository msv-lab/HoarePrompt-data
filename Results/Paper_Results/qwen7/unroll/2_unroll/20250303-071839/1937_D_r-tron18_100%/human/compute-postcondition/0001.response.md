Output State: **`pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`; `s1` is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>' where 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5; `totalOne` is the length of `pre`.**

Explanation: The code `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre`, which contains indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in the string `s1`. This value is stored in the variable `totalOne`. The initial state of `s1` and the structure of `pre` remain unchanged.
