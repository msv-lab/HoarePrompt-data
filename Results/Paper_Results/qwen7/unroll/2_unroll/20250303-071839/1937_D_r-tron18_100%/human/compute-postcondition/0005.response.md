Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `n-1` to `-1` with a step of `-1`. This means `i` will take values from `n-1` down to `0`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` set to `n-1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `n-1` before the loop starts.

4. **Check if the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0` for the loop to continue executing.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states accordingly:

- `i` must be initialized to `n-1`.
- `i` must remain greater than or equal to `0` throughout the loop iterations.

Now, let's formulate the final state:

**State: **`i` is `n-1`, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`**.

This ensures that the loop can start and continue executing as intended.
