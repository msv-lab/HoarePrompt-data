Output State: `ans` is a list of `n` integers calculated based on the conditions within the loop, `preOne` is an empty list, `pre` is a list containing indices i+1 for each occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `totalOne` is 0, `suffZero` is a list containing the value `[0]`.

To explain this output state in natural language:
After the loop has executed all its iterations, the `ans` list contains `n` integers that were determined by the conditions inside the loop. The `preOne` list is empty because it was being modified and popped in each iteration. The `pre` list remains unchanged as it was not modified within the loop. The `totalOne` variable is 0 since it was decremented in each iteration until it reached 0. The `suffZero` list remains with a single element `[0]` because it was only appended to when the character at the current index was not '>'.
