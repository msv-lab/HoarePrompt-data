The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the string `s1`. The length of `s1` is such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. 

The function returns a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`. Specifically, it checks if the number of '<' characters is equal to the number of '>' characters. If they are balanced (equal), the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` and an integer `n`, and returns `True` if the number of '<' characters is equal to the number of '>' characters in `s1`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
