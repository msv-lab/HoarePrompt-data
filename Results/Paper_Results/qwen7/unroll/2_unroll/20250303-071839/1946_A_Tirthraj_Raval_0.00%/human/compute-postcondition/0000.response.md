Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the array a contains n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

The given code is just a comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would change the values of the variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
