Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `cases`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `lex` which represents the encoded value.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The program attempts to decode the integer `lex` into three letters.
   - It uses a series of conditional checks to determine the values of the letters:
     - If `lex < 28`, it sets the first letter to 'a' (1) and subtracts 1 from `lex`.
     - If `lex < 52`, it sets the second letter to 'z' (26) and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - If `lex <= 78`, it sets the third letter to 'z' (26) and subtracts 26 from `lex`.
     - Finally, it appends the remaining value of `lex` to the list.

3. **Sorting and Conversion:**
   - The list `arr` is sorted.
   - Each value in the list is converted to the corresponding character using `chr(info[i][j] + 96)` and concatenated to form the word.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic used to determine the values of the letters is flawed. For instance, if `lex` is between 28 and 51, the program does not correctly handle these values.
   - The program assumes that the first two letters will always be 'a' and 'z', which is not true. There can be other combinations that yield the same encoded value.

2. **Sorting Before Conversion:**
   - Sorting the list before converting it to characters is unnecessary and incorrect. The correct approach should directly convert the values to characters without sorting.

3. **Handling All Possible Combinations:**
   - The program does not consider all possible combinations of letters that can sum up to the given encoded value. For example, for `lex = 24`, the correct answer should be "aaa" (1+1+1=3), not "aav".

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, we need to generate all possible combinations of three letters that sum up to the given encoded value and choose the lexicographically smallest one.

### Corrected Program

```python
from itertools import product

def find_smallest_word(lex):
    min_word = None
    for a, b, c in product(range(1, 27), repeat=3):
        if a + b + c == lex:
            word = f"{chr(a + 96)}{chr(b + 96)}{chr(c + 96)}"
            if min_word is None or word < min_word:
                min_word = word
    return min_word

def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        lex = int(input())
        print(find_smallest_word(lex))

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to flawed decoding logic and unnecessary sorting. The corrected program generates all possible combinations of three letters and finds the lexicographically smallest one that sums up to the given encoded value.

**Correctness: **False**
