Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `cases`.

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `cases` is an input integer and 1 <= cases <= 100.
   - `info` is an empty list.

3. Analyze the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `cases` is greater than 0.

4. Adjust the state of the objects in the loop head:
   - Since `cases` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `cases` is at least 1.
   - The value of `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop execution condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `cases` must be greater than 0.

State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `info` is an empty list**
