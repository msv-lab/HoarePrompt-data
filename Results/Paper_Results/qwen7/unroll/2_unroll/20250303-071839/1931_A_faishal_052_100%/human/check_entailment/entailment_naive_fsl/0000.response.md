Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `55`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded is `"czz"`, which corresponds to the indices `[3, 26, 26]`. However, the program incorrectly processes this case. Let's break down the program's logic for `n = 55`:

1. The first loop processes the first two characters:
   - Since `55 >= 28`, the first character is set to `26`.
   - After setting the first character to `26`, `lex` becomes `29`.
   - Since `29 >= 28`, the second character is again set to `26`.
   - After setting the second character to `26`, `lex` becomes `3`.

2. The third character is then set to `3`, which results in the word `"azz"` instead of `"czz"`.

Therefore, the program does not generate the correct lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values, making it incorrect.
