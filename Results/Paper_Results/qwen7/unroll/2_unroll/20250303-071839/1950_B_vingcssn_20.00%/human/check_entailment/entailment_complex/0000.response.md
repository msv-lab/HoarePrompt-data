Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly generate the required 2n x 2n checkerboard pattern for values of \( n \) greater than 4. The program only handles the cases for \( n = 1, 2, 3, \) and \( 4 \) explicitly and prints predefined patterns for these cases. However, the problem description requires a solution that can handle any \( n \) within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \). 

For \( n > 4 \), the program should follow the checkerboard pattern but the current implementation does not provide a general solution for generating the pattern. Instead, it prints "No esta en el rango" (which means 'Not in the range') for any input outside the hardcoded range of 1 to 4.

Given that the program does not provide a general solution for generating the checkerboard pattern for all valid \( n \), the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
