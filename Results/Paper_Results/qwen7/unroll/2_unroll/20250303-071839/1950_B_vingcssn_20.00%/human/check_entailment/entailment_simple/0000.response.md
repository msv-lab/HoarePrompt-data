Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a 2n Ã— 2n checkerboard where the top-left cell is `#` and the pattern alternates between `#` and `.`.
- The provided solution only handles the cases for `n = 1, 2, 3, 4` explicitly and prints predefined patterns for these values.
- For any other value of `n`, the code does not generate the correct checkerboard pattern but instead prints "No esta en el rango" (which means "Not in the range").
- The correct approach should involve generating the pattern dynamically based on the value of `n`, not just hardcoding the patterns for specific values.

Given this analysis, the provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle the general case correctly for all valid `n`.

Correctness: **False**
