Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each string `s`, the program checks if all characters in `s` are unique by converting `s` into a set `a`. If the length of the set `a` is 1, it means all characters in `s` are the same, and thus, no rearrangement can produce a different string. In this case, the program correctly prints 'NO'.
3. If the characters are not all the same, the program prints 'YES' and then generates two permutations of the string `s`: 
   - `b` is the lexicographically smallest permutation of `s`.
   - `c` is the reverse of the lexicographically largest permutation of `s`.
4. The program then compares `b` with the original string `s`. If `b` is not equal to `s`, it prints `b`; otherwise, it prints `c`.

Given the problem statement, the logic implemented in the program matches the requirements. The program correctly handles all edge cases, such as strings with all identical characters, and provides valid rearrangements for other strings.

Correctness: **True**
