State: **`nabors` must be greater than 0, `_` is now 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and `nabors`.
- The loop will execute if `nabors` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is a placeholder that takes on values from 0 to `nabors-1` during each iteration of the loop, but its initial value before the loop starts is 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `nabors` must be greater than 0, and `_` is initially set to 0.
