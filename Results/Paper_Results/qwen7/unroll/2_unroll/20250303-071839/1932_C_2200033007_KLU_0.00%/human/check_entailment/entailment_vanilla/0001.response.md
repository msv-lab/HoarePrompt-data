Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the specified logic.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the array `a` and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly handle the product calculation and the removal of elements as per the problem statement.

3. **Current Implementation of `func_1`:**
   - It initializes an empty list `b` and uses indices `l` and `r` to track the left and right boundaries of the array `a`.
   - Instead of calculating the product of the remaining elements in the array, it incorrectly appends the elements at positions `l` and `r` to `b` without removing them from `a`.
   - It then calculates the product of the elements in `b` in reverse order and appends these products to `ans`.

4. **Correct Logic:**
   - We need to maintain the product of the remaining elements in the array `a` and update this product as elements are removed.
   - After processing each command, we should append the current product modulo `m` to the result list.

### Corrected Implementation:

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    prod = 1
    for i in range(n):
        # Calculate the product of the remaining elements
        for j in range(i):
            prod = (prod * a[j]) % m
        
        # Process the command
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)  # Remove the leftmost element
        else:
            a.pop()   # Remove the rightmost element
        
        # Append the current product modulo m
        b.append(prod)
    
    return b
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `prod` is initialized to 1 to store the product of the remaining elements.
   - `b` is used to store the results.

2. **Loop through each command:**
   - For each command, calculate the product of the remaining elements up to the current index `i`.
   - Update the product modulo `m` after each command.
   - Remove the appropriate element from the array `a` based on the command (`L` or `R`).
   - Append the current product modulo `m` to the result list `b`.

3. **Return the result:**
   - Return the list `b` containing the required remainders.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the product calculation and the removal of elements. The corrected implementation above should be used instead.

**Correctness: False**
