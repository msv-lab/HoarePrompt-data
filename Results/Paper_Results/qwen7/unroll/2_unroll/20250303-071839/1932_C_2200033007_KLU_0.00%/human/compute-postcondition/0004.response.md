Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'L') or `a[r]` (if corresponding `s[i]` is 'R'), with `l` starting at 0 and `r` starting at `n-1`, and moving towards each other until the list is fully populated based on the direction indicated by the string `s`.
