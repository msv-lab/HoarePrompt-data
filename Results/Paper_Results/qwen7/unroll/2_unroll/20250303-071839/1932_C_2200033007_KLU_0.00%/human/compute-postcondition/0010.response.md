Output State: `b` is a list of `n` integers where each element is either `a[l]` or `a[r]` based on the corresponding character in `s`. The final values of `l` and `r` will be `n-1` and 0 respectively, `ans` is a list of length `n` with elements being the cumulative product of the reversed list `b`, starting from the first element, `p` is the last value it was updated to after the loop, which is the product of all elements in the reversed list `b`.
