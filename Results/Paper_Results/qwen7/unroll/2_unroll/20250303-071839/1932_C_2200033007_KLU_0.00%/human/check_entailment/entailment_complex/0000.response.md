Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is supposed to process the array `a` according to the commands in `s` and compute the required remainders at each step.

2. **Initial State**: The function receives `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s` as inputs. `n` and `m` are positive integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only 'L' and 'R'.

3. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function constructs a list `b` by iterating over `s` but does not actually perform the required operations (calculating the product and removing elements).
   - Instead of calculating the product of the remaining elements in `a` and appending the remainder to `ans`, the function incorrectly appends elements from `a` to `b` based on the direction specified in `s`.
   - After constructing `b`, the function calculates the cumulative product of the reversed list `b` and appends these products to `ans`. However, `b` does not represent the correct state of the array `a` after processing the commands.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - The function should maintain the state of the array `a` as it processes each command.
   - For each command, calculate the product of the remaining elements in `a` and append the remainder when divided by `m` to `ans`.
   - Remove the appropriate element from `a` based on the command ('L' or 'R').

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the process of removing elements from `a` and calculating the required remainders.

Correctness: **False**
