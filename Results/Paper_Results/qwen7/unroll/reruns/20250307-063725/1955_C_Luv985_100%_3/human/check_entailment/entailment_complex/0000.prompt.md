Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #
    #The loop processes each test case defined by `T`. For each test case, it initializes `n` and `k`, reads the list `a` of length `n`, and then iterates through the list to reduce its elements based on the value of `k`. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many elements in `a` become zero after these operations. If at any point the remaining elements cannot be reduced further with the given `k`, the loop breaks. After processing all elements or when `l` equals `r`, it checks if the last element can be reduced by `k` and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of zeros in the list `a` across all test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( T \), followed by pairs of integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it reduces the elements of the list \( a \) based on the value of \( k \) until no more reductions can be made. It counts the number of elements in \( a \) that become zero after these operations and prints the total count of such elements across all test cases.
