Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `T`.
2. **Determine the initial state**: 
   - `T` is an input integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{15}\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` positive integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all \(1 \leq i \leq n\).

3. **Check the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `T` is non-zero.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop executes at least once, `T` must be non-zero. Since `T` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `T` is not zero.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `T` must not be zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` must not be zero, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n**.
