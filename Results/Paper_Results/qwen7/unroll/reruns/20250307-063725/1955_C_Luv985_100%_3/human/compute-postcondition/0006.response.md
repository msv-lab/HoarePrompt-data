Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( T \), followed by pairs of integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it reduces the elements of the list \( a \) based on the value of \( k \) until no more reductions can be made. It counts the number of elements in \( a \) that become zero after these operations and prints the total count of such elements across all test cases.**
