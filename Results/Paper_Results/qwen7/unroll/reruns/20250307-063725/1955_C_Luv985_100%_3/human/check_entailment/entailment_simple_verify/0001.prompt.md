You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #
    #The loop processes each test case defined by `T`. For each test case, it initializes `n` and `k`, reads the list `a` of length `n`, and then iterates through the list to reduce its elements based on the value of `k`. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many elements in `a` become zero after these operations. If at any point the remaining elements cannot be reduced further with the given `k`, the loop breaks. After processing all elements or when `l` equals `r`, it checks if the last element can be reduced by `k` and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of zeros in the list `a` across all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the process where the Kraken attacks the ships in a specific pattern (first, last, first, etc.) until all ships sink.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the targeted ship by 1. A ship sinks when its durability reaches 0.
   - The goal is to count how many ships sink after `k` attacks.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`T`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships (`n`) and the number of attacks (`k`).
   - It also reads the durability of each ship (`a`).
   - The program uses two pointers (`l` and `r`) to keep track of the first and last ships, respectively.
   - The main loop runs until either `l` equals `r` or `k` becomes 0.
     - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi`).
     - If `mi * 2` is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces both ships' durability by `mi` and decreases `k` by `mi * 2`.
     - If a ship's durability reaches 0, it increments the answer (`ans`) and adjusts the pointer accordingly.
     - If `mi * 2` is greater than `k`, it calculates the remaining attacks (`t = k % 2`) and checks if the current ship can be sunk with these remaining attacks.
   - After the loop, if `l` equals `r`, it checks if the last ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - Finally, it prints the number of ships that sank.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for handling the attacks and sinking ships seems correct.
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the last ship is the only one left and needs to be checked separately.
   - The use of modulo operation to handle the remaining attacks is appropriate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where a ship's durability is reduced to 0 and stops being attacked.
   - It correctly counts the number of ships that sink based on the given number of attacks.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly simulates the process described in the problem statement and handles all necessary edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
