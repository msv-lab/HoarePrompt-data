You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #
    #The loop processes each test case defined by `T`. For each test case, it initializes `n` and `k`, reads the list `a` of length `n`, and then iterates through the list to reduce its elements based on the value of `k`. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many elements in `a` become zero after these operations. If at any point the remaining elements cannot be reduced further with the given `k`, the loop breaks. After processing all elements or when `l` equals `r`, it checks if the last element can be reduced by `k` and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of zeros in the list `a` across all test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where a ship's durability is reduced to zero and is no longer subject to further attacks. Let's consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  3
  ```

### Explanation:
- The program incorrectly counts the number of ships sunk. According to the problem description, the Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0, and then the last ship, also reducing its durability to 0. After these attacks, the remaining ships are `[2, 4, 2]`. The next attack on the first ship would reduce its durability to 1, and the subsequent attack on the last ship would reduce its durability to 1. Since the durability of both the first and last ships is still greater than 0, the program incorrectly increments the count of sunk ships.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that once a ship's durability reaches 0, it is no longer considered for further attacks. This can be achieved by maintaining a separate list or set of indices of ships that have sunk and skipping those indices during the attacks.
