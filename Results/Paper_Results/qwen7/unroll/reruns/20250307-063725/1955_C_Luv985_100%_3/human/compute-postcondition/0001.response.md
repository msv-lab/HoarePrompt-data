Output State: **`T` is an input integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**

The code `T = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `T`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
