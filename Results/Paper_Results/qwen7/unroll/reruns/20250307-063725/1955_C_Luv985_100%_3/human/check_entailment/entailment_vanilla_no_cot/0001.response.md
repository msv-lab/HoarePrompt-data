### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program uses two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to simulate the Kraken's attacks.
   - It iterates through the list of ships, alternating between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - The logic inside the loop is designed to handle the reduction of durability and counting the number of sunk ships.

3. **Handling Durability Reduction**:
   - The program correctly handles the reduction of durability by taking the minimum of the current left and right ship's durability.
   - If both ships' durabilities can be reduced by the same amount, they are reduced accordingly.
   - If the remaining durability of a ship is less than the number of attacks left, the program correctly breaks the loop and increments the answer.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `l` equals `r` (i.e., only one ship remains) correctly.
   - It also handles the case where the remaining durability of the last ship is exactly equal to the remaining attacks, which should result in the ship sinking.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, it appears that the logic is correctly implemented to handle the given problem statement. The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships.
