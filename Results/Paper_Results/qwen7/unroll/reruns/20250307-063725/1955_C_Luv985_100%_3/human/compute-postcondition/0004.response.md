Output State: The value of `ans`, which represents the number of elements in the list `a` that become zero after performing the operations specified in the loop for each test case.

The loop processes each test case defined by `T`. For each test case, it initializes `n` and `k`, reads the list `a` of length `n`, and then iterates through the list to reduce its elements based on the value of `k`. The variable `ans` keeps track of how many elements in `a` become zero after these operations. If at any point the remaining elements cannot be reduced further with the given `k`, the loop breaks. After processing all elements or when `l` equals `r`, it checks if the last element can be reduced by `k` and increments `ans` accordingly. Finally, it prints the total count of zeros in the list `a` across all test cases.
