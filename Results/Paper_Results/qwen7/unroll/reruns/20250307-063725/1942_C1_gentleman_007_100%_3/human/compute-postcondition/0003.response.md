The only variable in the loop head is `len(q)`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `len(q)` being greater than 0. Right before the loop, `q` is a deque with the element `ver` appended to it, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1. This means `q` is not empty, and thus `len(q)` is at least 1.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary because the loop condition `len(q)` is already satisfied.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that y = 0; `q` is a deque, and `q` has the element `ver` appended to it; `vis[ver]` is set to 1**
