Functionality: **The function accepts a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters and a list `b` of integers representing indices of characters in `a`. The length of `b` is equal to the value of `x`. It returns the reverse of the longest common subsequence of characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`.**
