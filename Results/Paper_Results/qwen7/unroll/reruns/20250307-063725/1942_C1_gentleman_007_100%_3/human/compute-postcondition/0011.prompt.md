You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, b is a list of integers representing indices of characters in the string a, and the length of b is equal to the value of x.
def func_22(a, b):
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a list of integers representing indices of characters in the string `a`, and the length of `b` is equal to the value of `x`, `dp` is a 2D list where each element is filled based on the longest common subsequence (LCS) of the substring of `a` up to index `i-1` and the subsequence of `b` up to index `j-1`. Specifically, `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the substring `a[:i]` and the subsequence `b[:j]`.
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: The variable `l` will contain the characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`.
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the reverse of the longest common subsequence of characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters and a list `b` of integers representing indices of characters in `a`. The length of `b` is equal to the value of `x`. It returns the reverse of the longest common subsequence of characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the reverse of the longest common subsequence of characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
