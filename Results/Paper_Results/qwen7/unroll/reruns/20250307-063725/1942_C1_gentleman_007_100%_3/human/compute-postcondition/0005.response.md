Output State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the nodes visited in a breadth-first search (BFS) order starting from the initial node `ver`.

Explanation: The given code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`. In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is removed from the front of the deque using `q.popleft()`, and its value is printed. Then, for each neighbor `node` of `ver` in the graph, if the neighbor has not been visited (`not vis[node]`), it is appended to the deque `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node] = 1`. This process ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their shortest path from the starting node `ver`. The `end=' '` in `print(ver, end=' ')` ensures that the nodes are printed on the same line separated by spaces.
