The provided function `func_25` does not seem to directly relate to the problem description or the example problem. It appears to be a breadth-first search (BFS) function, but it is not clear how it fits into the context of the cake cutting problem described. Therefore, I will focus on extracting the precondition based on the problem description and the input variables in the function signature.

Given the problem description and the input variables in the function signature, here is the precondition:

Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. The input consists of t test cases, each containing n, x, and y followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
