The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of sides of a polygon), `m` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices). After execution, it returns a 2D list where each row contains the list `v`, repeated `n` times.
