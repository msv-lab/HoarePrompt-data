l is a 2D list of integers where each sublist has the same length m, representing a matrix of non-negative integers, and n is a positive integer such that 0 <= n < len(l) and 0 <= m <= len(l[0]). However, the function provided does not seem to be related to the problem description. The variables n, x, and y, as well as the list of chosen vertices, are not used in this function.
