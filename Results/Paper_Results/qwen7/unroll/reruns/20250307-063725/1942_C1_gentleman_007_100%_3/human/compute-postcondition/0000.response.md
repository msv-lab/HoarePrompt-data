Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that y = 0; `q` is a deque.**

The code initializes an empty deque named `q`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the only new information added is the existence of the deque `q`.
