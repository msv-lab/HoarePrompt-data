Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads a line of space-separated integers from user input, splits the line into individual integers, converts them to integers, and returns them as a list. This process is performed for each test case within the constraints specified.
Function number 3 :
 Code:

After execution, it returns a 2D list where each row contains the list `v`, repeated `n` times.
Function number 5 :

 Output hints for function5:  The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list of lists `l`, where each sublist contains up to `m` integers representing the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex in the polygon, as determined by the function `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list `l` that maps each vertex in the polygon to its connected vertices based on the output of `func_1`.

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a 2D list `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1). For each pair of indices `(x, y)` returned by the function `func_1()`, it sets the corresponding elements `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` to 1.

 Output hints for function11:  The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns a list `p` containing all prime numbers up to `num`. After executing the function, the variable `prime` will be a list of length `num + 1` where the first two elements (0 and 1) are still False, and the rest of the elements will be True for all prime numbers and False for all non-prime numbers up to `num`. The `Lowest_Prime` list will contain the smallest prime factor for each number from 0 to `num`, with 0 indicating that the number is either 0 or 1. The `Highest_Prime` list will contain the largest prime factor for each number from 0 to `num`, which will be the same as the value in `Lowest_Prime` since the loop updates both lists simultaneously for each prime factor found.

It computes the prime factorization of `num` and returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the prime factors and the values are their respective exponents.

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts an integer `n` such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. Each key in the dictionary represents a prime factor of `n`, and the corresponding value represents the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization of `n`. The function iterates through possible divisors starting from 2 and updates the dictionary with the prime factors and their exponents until `n` becomes 1. If `n` is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means `n` itself is a prime number and is added to the dictionary with an exponent of 1.
Function number 14 :
 Code:

 Output hints for function15:  The function calculates the factorial of \( n \) and returns the result modulo \( mod \). Given the constraints \( 4 \leq n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) \), the function computes \( n! \mod mod \) and ensures the result fits within the specified limits.

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr` containing values based on the Fibonacci sequence. If `mod` is not -1, each element in `dearr` from index 2 to `n` is calculated as ((i-1) % `mod` * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % `mod`) % `mod`. If `mod` is -1, `dearr` contains the first `n-1` Fibonacci numbers starting from 1. The initial values of `dearr` are always [1, 0].

 Output hints for function25:  The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each vertex specified in the input test cases. For each test case, it prints the vertices visited during the BFS traversal in the order they were discovered, ensuring that the output reflects the shortest paths from the starting vertex. The function does not return any value but outputs the sequence of visited vertices for each test case on the same line, separated by spaces.
