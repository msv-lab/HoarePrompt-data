The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr`. It achieves this by iterating through each element in `arr`, using binary search to find the correct position in a growing list `l` to either append a new unique element or replace an existing one, ensuring `l` remains sorted and contains only unique values.
