Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that y = 0; `q` is a deque, and `q` has the element `ver` appended to it; `vis[ver]` is set to 1.**

In this code, `vis[ver]` is assigned the value 1, indicating that the node or element `ver` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
