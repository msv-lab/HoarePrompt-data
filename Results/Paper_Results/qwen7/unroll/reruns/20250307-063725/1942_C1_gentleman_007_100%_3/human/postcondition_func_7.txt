The function accepts a 2D list `l` of non-negative integers, where each sublist has the same length. It returns a 2D list `p` with dimensions `(n+1, m+1)`, where each element `p[i][j]` (for `i` from 0 to `n`, `j` from 0 to `m`) contains the sum of all elements in the sublists of `l` up to index `i-1` and `j-1` inclusive. Specifically, `p[i][j]` represents the sum of the submatrix of `l` from `(0,0)` to `(i-1,j-1)`.
