Output State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the nodes of the graph, printed in the order they were visited during a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the initial node `ver`.

Explanation: The given code performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on a graph. The loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`. During each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is removed from `q` using `popleft()`, and its value is printed. Then, for each unvisited neighbor of `ver`, the neighbor is added to `q` and marked as visited in the `vis` list. This process ensures that nodes are visited level by level, starting from the initial node `ver`. The output is a sequence of node IDs, reflecting the order in which they were visited during the BFS traversal.
