Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon. The solution logic should focus on calculating the number of triangles that can be formed based on the given constraints.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - Given a polygon with `n` sides and `x` vertices chosen by Bessie, we need to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The maximum number of triangles that can be formed from `x` vertices is `x - 2` because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and the first 2 vertices form the base of the first triangle, leaving `x - 2` for additional triangles.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided program reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It sorts the chosen vertices and checks for consecutive vertices to increment the triangle count.
   - The main logic is in the loop where it calculates the number of triangles by checking for consecutive vertices and handling edge cases (like the first and last vertex forming a triangle).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first and last vertices form a triangle with any other chosen vertex.
   - The sorting and consecutive check ensure that all possible triangles are considered.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum number of triangles for each test case, which matches the expected output.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Correctness: **True**
