You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. The input consists of t test cases, each containing n, x, and y followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the nodes visited in a breadth-first search (BFS) order starting from the initial node `ver`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`. In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is removed from the front of the deque using `q.popleft()`, and its value is printed. Then, for each neighbor `node` of `ver` in the graph, if the neighbor has not been visited (`not vis[node]`), it is appended to the deque `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node] = 1`. This process ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their shortest path from the starting node `ver`. The `end=' '` in `print(ver, end=' ')` ensures that the nodes are printed on the same line separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `ver`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case contains integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It processes these test cases without returning any specific value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
