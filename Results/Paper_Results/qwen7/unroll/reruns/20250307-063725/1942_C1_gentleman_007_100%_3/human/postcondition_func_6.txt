The function accepts a list of integers `l`, where each integer represents a vertex chosen by Bessie. It processes this list to create and return a dictionary `d`. In the returned dictionary, each key is a unique vertex from the input list, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that vertex appears in the input list.
