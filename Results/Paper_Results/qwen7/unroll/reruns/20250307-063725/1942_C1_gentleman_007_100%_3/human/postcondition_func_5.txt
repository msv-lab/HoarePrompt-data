The function `func_6` takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a 2D list `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1). For each pair of indices `(x, y)` returned by the function `func_1()`, it sets the corresponding elements `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` to 1. The final state of the 2D list `l` contains 1s at the positions corresponding to all pairs `(x, y)` returned by `func_1()` during the loop iterations.
