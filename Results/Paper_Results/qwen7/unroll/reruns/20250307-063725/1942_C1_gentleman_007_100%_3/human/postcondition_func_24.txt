The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each vertex specified in the input test cases. For each test case, it prints the vertices visited during the BFS traversal in the order they were discovered, ensuring that the output reflects the shortest paths from the starting vertex. The function does not return any value but outputs the sequence of visited vertices for each test case on the same line, separated by spaces.
