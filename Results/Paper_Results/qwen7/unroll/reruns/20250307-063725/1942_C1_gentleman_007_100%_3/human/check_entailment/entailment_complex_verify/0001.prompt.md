You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Specifically, `dp[i][j]` contains the length of the LCS of the substring `a[:i]` and the subsequence `b[:j]`.

    #The program returns the reverse of the longest common subsequence of characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters and a list `b` of integers representing indices of characters in `a`. It calculates the longest common subsequence of characters from string `a` that form the longest common subsequence with the list `b`, and returns the reverse of this subsequence.

def func_23(arr):
    l = []

    #The program returns the length of the sorted list 'l' which contains all unique elements from 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of a sorted list containing all unique elements from `arr`. It achieves this by iterating through each element in `arr`, using binary search to find the correct position in a growing list `l` to either append a new unique element or replace an existing one, ensuring `l` remains sorted and contains only unique values.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, vis is a list or array of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited.
def func_24(ver):
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)

    #State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the vertices of the polygon, printed in the order they were visited during the depth-first search traversal.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a polygon represented by a graph. It starts from a given vertex and visits all reachable vertices, printing them in the order of their visit. The function marks each visited vertex in the `vis` list.

The input consists of t test cases, each containing n, x, and y followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the nodes visited in a breadth-first search (BFS) order starting from the initial node `ver`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`. In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is removed from the front of the deque using `q.popleft()`, and its value is printed. Then, for each neighbor `node` of `ver` in the graph, if the neighbor has not been visited (`not vis[node]`), it is appended to the deque `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node] = 1`. This process ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their shortest path from the starting node `ver`. The `end=' '` in `print(ver, end=' ')` ensures that the nodes are printed on the same line separated by spaces.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) starting from each vertex specified in the input test cases. For each test case, it prints the vertices visited during the BFS traversal in the order they were discovered, ensuring that the output reflects the shortest paths from the starting vertex. The function does not return any value but outputs the sequence of visited vertices for each test case on the same line, separated by spaces.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The key observation here is that any convex polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.

2. **Given Code Analysis**: The provided code contains numerous helper functions (functions 1 to 25), but none of these functions seem to directly address the problem at hand. The problem requires a straightforward combinatorial approach rather than complex graph or number theory operations.

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - For a polygon with `n` sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `n-2`. This is because each additional triangle added to the polygon reduces the number of sides by one.
   - Given that Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices, we need to determine how many additional vertices we can choose (`y` in this case, which is 0). Since `y = 0`, we cannot choose any additional vertices.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is `n - 2 - (x - 2)` where `x - 2` accounts for the initial triangles formed by the chosen vertices.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We can implement a simple function to calculate the maximum number of triangles as follows:
     ```python
     def max_triangles(n, x, y):
         # Since y = 0, we do not add any extra vertices
         return max(0, n - 2 - (x - 2))
     ```

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For the given examples:
     - Test Case 1: `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 0`
       - Maximum triangles: `8 - 2 - (4 - 2) = 4 - 2 = 2`
     - Test Case 2: `n = 8`, `x = 8`, `y = 0`
       - Maximum triangles: `8 - 2 - (8 - 2) = 6 - 6 = 0`
     - Test Case 3: `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 0`
       - Maximum triangles: `4 - 2 - (2 - 2) = 2 - 0 = 2`

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not contain any function that solves the problem correctly. It includes various utility functions but lacks the core logic to solve the problem.
