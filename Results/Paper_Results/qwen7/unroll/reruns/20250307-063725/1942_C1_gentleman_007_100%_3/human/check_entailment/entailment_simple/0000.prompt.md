# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

The initial values of `dearr` are `[1, 0]`, and these are preserved as they correspond to indices 0 and 1. For each iteration `i` starting from 3 up to `n`, a new value is calculated and appended to `dearr`. The variables `x` and `y` are not affected by the loop and thus remain unchanged at 0.
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` remains as the initial number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` remains as the initial maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen with a current value of 0, and `dearr` is a list containing the values `[1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, ..., F(n-1)]` if `mod == -1`, otherwise `dearr` is a list containing the values `[1, 0] + [(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod for i in range(3, n+1)]`.
    return dearr
    #The program returns a list `dearr` which contains values based on the Fibonacci sequence adjusted by `mod` if `mod != -1`. The list starts with [1, 0] and each subsequent value is calculated as ((i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod) % mod for i from 3 to n. If `mod == -1`, the list is simply the first n-1 Fibonacci numbers starting from 1.

    #Explanation: The given loop implements a fast exponentiation algorithm. It calculates \(a^b \mod \text{mod}\). Here's how it works:
    #
    #- The variable `b` is decremented by halving it in each iteration (`b >>= 1`), which effectively reduces the exponent.
    #- If `b` is odd (`b & 1`), `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `a` and taking the modulus with `mod`. This step accounts for the current bit position in the binary representation of `b`.
    #- `a` is squared and reduced modulo `mod` in each iteration, which updates the base for the next bit position.
    #
    #After the loop completes, `ans` holds the result of \(a^b \mod \text{mod}\).

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the nodes visited in a breadth-first search (BFS) order starting from the initial node `ver`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given code implements a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The `while` loop continues as long as there are elements in the deque `q`. In each iteration, the first element (`ver`) is removed from the front of the deque using `q.popleft()`, and its value is printed. Then, for each neighbor `node` of `ver` in the graph, if the neighbor has not been visited (`not vis[node]`), it is appended to the deque `q` and marked as visited by setting `vis[node] = 1`. This process ensures that nodes are visited in the order of their shortest path from the starting node `ver`. The `end=' '` in `print(ver, end=' ')` ensures that the nodes are printed on the same line separated by spaces.
