Reasoning: 
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a polygon with \( n \) sides, given \( x \) vertices chosen by Bessie and a limit \( y \) (which is 0 in this version) on the number of additional vertices you can choose.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - The solution can be derived from the number of vertices chosen by Bessie, as the maximum number of triangles that can be formed from \( x \) vertices is \( x - 2 \).
   - Since \( y = 0 \), no additional vertices can be chosen, so the answer is simply \( x - 2 \) for each test case.
3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - It calculates the number of triangles as \( x - 2 \) for each test case and prints the result.
   - There are no unnecessary or incorrect operations or logic errors in the code.

Given the above points, the code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
