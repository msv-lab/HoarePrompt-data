The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`. `ver` is a list or tuple containing test cases, where each test case is a list or tuple consisting of three integers: `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed 2 â‹… 10^5. The function does not return any value based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `ver`, which is a list of test cases. Each test case contains integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, followed by `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. It processes these test cases without returning any specific value.**
