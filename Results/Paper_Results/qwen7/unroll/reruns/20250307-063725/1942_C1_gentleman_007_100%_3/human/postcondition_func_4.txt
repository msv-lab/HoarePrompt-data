The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list of lists `l`, where each sublist contains up to `m` integers representing the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex in the polygon, as determined by the function `func_1`. After the function concludes, the program state includes a list `l` that maps each vertex in the polygon to its connected vertices based on the output of `func_1`.
