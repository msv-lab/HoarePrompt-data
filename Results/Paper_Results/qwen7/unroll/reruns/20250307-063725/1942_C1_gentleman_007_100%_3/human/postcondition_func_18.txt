The function accepts a list of integers `p` (sorted in ascending order) and an integer `x` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ max(p)). If no element in `p` is greater than or equal to `x`, it returns the length of the list `p`. Otherwise, it returns the index `mid` where `p[mid]` is the smallest value that is greater than or equal to `x`.
