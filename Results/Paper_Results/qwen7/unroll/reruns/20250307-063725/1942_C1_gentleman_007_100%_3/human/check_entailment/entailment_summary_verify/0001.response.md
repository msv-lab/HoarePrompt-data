### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed using the given vertices. The key observation is that any convex polygon can be divided into triangles by drawing non-intersecting diagonals.
   - The formula to find the maximum number of triangles in a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( n - 2 \).
   - Given that Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices, we need to determine how many additional vertices we can choose (which is \( y \) in this case, and \( y = 0 \)). Since \( y = 0 \), we cannot choose any additional vertices.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code contains numerous helper functions (functions 1 to 25), but none of these functions directly address the problem at hand. The problem requires a straightforward combinatorial approach rather than complex graph or number theory operations.
   - The core logic needed is simply to compute \( n - 2 - (x - 2) \) since \( y = 0 \).

3. **Solution Approach**:
   - The maximum number of triangles that can be formed is \( n - 2 \) minus the number of triangles already formed by the chosen vertices \( x \).
   - Since \( y = 0 \), the number of additional vertices we can choose is zero, so the formula simplifies to \( n - 2 - (x - 2) = n - x \).

4. **Implementation**:
   - We can implement a simple function to calculate the maximum number of triangles as follows:
     ```python
     def max_triangles(n, x, y):
         # Since y = 0, we do not add any extra vertices
         return max(0, n - x)
     ```

5. **Testing the Solution**:
   - For the given examples:
     - Test Case 1: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \)
       - Maximum triangles: \( 8 - 4 = 4 \)
     - Test Case 2: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), \( y = 0 \)
       - Maximum triangles: \( 8 - 8 = 0 \)
     - Test Case 3: \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), \( y = 0 \)
       - Maximum triangles: \( 4 - 2 = 2 \)

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not contain any function that solves the problem correctly. It includes various utility functions but lacks the core logic to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
