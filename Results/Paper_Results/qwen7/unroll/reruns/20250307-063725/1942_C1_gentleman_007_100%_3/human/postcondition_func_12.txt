The function accepts an integer `n` such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. Each key in the dictionary represents a prime factor of `n`, and the corresponding value represents the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization of `n`. The function iterates through possible divisors starting from 2 and updates the dictionary with the prime factors and their exponents until `n` becomes 1. If `n` is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means `n` itself is a prime number and is added to the dictionary with an exponent of 1.
