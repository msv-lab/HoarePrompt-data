The function accepts a non-negative integer \( x \) and returns 0 or 1. If \( x \) is 0 or 1, it directly returns \( x \). Otherwise, it searches for the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to \( x \), but if no such integer exists (i.e., \( x \) is not a perfect square), it still returns 0 or 1 based on the initial value of \( x \).
