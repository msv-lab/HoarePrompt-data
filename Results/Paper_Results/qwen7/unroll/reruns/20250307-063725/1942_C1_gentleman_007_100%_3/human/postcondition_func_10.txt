The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns a list `p` containing all prime numbers up to `num`. After executing the function, the variable `prime` will be a list of length `num + 1` where the first two elements (0 and 1) are still False, and the rest of the elements will be True for all prime numbers and False for all non-prime numbers up to `num`. The `Lowest_Prime` list will contain the smallest prime factor for each number from 0 to `num`, with 0 indicating that the number is either 0 or 1. The `Highest_Prime` list will contain the largest prime factor for each number from 0 to `num`, which will be the same as the value in `Lowest_Prime` since the loop updates both lists simultaneously for each prime factor found.
