The function accepts a positive integer `num` and a dictionary `Prime_array` containing prime numbers and their exponents in the factorization of `num`. It computes the prime factorization of `num` and returns a dictionary `d` where the keys are the prime factors and the values are their respective exponents. For instance, if `num` is 60, the function returns `{2: 2, 3: 1, 5: 1}`.
