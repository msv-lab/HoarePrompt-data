Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS"; an additional input is taken.**

Explanation: The code `input()` reads an additional input from the user, but it does not assign this input to any variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. An additional input is taken, which could be stored in a variable if specified in further code.
