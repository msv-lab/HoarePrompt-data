Output State: `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `t` remains the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `n` remains the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `trump` remains the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `answers` is a list containing strings of card ranks and suits that were compared and found to be in different suits than the `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where the suit has been determined (not None) or remains None if no card of that suit was compared. If `trumps` is not empty, for each card rank and suit pair in `suits` that has a non-None suit, an answer string is appended to `answers` by pairing the rank and suit with the last element of `trumps` and the `trump` suit. If `trumps` is empty, the loop prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns immediately.
