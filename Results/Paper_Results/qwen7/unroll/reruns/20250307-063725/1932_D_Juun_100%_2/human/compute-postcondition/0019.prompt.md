You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `t` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `n` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `trump` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `answers` is a list containing strings of card ranks and suits that were compared and found to be in different suits than the `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where the suit has been determined (not None) or remains None if no card of that suit was compared.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the `trump` suit, `t` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `n` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `trump` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `answers` is a list containing strings of card ranks and suits that were compared and found to be in different suits than the `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where the suit has been determined (not None) or remains None if no card of that suit was compared, `answers` will contain formatted strings of cards from `suits` that do not match the `trump` suit, and `trumps` will be empty after all matching cards are popped.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The loop will execute until `trumps` is empty, printing pairs of elements from `trumps` in reverse order, each followed by the `trump` rank and suit.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop does not modify or use the variable `trumps`, and the code provided only iterates over `answers` without referencing `trumps`. Therefore, there is no change in the state of `trumps` after the loop executes. The loop simply prints each element in the `answers` list one by one without any additional information about the `trump` rank and suit.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), and a string representing the trump suit ("CDHS"). It also accepts a list of 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS"). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
