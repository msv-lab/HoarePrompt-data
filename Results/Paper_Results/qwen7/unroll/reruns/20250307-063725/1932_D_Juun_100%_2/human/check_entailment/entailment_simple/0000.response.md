Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes variables.
2. It processes the cards to separate the trump cards and determine the non-trump suits.
3. The logic for handling trump cards and non-trump cards is implemented correctly:
   - Trump cards are matched against each other in descending order.
   - Non-trump cards are matched against trump cards if available, or marked as impossible if no trump cards remain.
4. The output format matches the requirements, and the program handles all given examples correctly.
5. The program does not modify the state of `trumps` after the main processing loop, ensuring that the final output is consistent with the logic.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
