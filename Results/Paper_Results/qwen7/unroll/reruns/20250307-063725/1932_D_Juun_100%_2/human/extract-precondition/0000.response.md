Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS").**
