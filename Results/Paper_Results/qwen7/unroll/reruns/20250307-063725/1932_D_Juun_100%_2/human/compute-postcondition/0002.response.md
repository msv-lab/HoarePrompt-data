Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump` is the input string from the additional input.**

The code initializes an empty list named `trumps`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `trump` remain unchanged from their initial states.
