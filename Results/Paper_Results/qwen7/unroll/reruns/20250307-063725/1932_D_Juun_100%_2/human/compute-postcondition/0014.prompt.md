Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a list of ranks sorted in descending order, `t` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `n` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `trump` is the same as the initial value since it's not used in the loop, `answers` is a list containing strings of card ranks and suits that were compared and found to be in different suits than the `trump`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values where the suit has been determined (not None) or remains None if no card of that suit was compared, `answers` will contain formatted strings of cards from `suits` that do not match the `trump` suit, and `trumps` will be empty after all matching cards are popped.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
