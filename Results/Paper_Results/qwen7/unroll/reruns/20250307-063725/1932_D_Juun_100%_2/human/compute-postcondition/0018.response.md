Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), and a string representing the trump suit ("CDHS"). It also accepts a list of 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS"). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

This functionality describes a function that processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of cards, without returning any explicit output based on the given information.
