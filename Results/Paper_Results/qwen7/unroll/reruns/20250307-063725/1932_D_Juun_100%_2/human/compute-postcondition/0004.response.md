Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump` is the input string from the additional input, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to None.**

Explanation: The code initializes a dictionary `suits` with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and sets their values to `None`. This does not affect the values of `trumps`, `t`, `n`, `trump`, or `answers`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
