Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and modify the `sequence` list.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The core logic involves finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `number` and then recursively generating the sequence for the remaining part of `number`.

2. **Sequence Generation**:
   - The sequence generation process ensures that the resulting sequence has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The sequence is built in a way that it can be reversed and contains values from 0 to 16, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

3. **Output Handling**:
   - After the sequence is generated, the program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The sequence is constructed to have exactly `X` increasing subsequences, which is verified through the recursive calls and modifications.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case correctly when `number` is 0, returning 0.
   - The function ensures that the sequence is constructed to match the required number of increasing subsequences.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence that meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The overall structure and logic of the program are sound and handle the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
