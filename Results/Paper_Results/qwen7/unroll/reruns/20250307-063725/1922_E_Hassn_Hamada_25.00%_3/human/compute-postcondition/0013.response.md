Output State: size is 17, sequence is [16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], result is the return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)

Explanation: The loop iterates 17 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 16. For each iteration, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and then the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` is incremented by `result`. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations, the sequence is effectively reversed during the loop's execution.
