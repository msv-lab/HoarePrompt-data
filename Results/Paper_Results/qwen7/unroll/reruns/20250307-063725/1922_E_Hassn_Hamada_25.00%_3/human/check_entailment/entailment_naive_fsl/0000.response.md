Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. 

For instance, consider the input `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence, but it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all necessary cases to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

A correct solution would involve generating a sequence that can be manipulated to produce the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`. The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
