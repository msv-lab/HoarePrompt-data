You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: number is an integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence. The input number is not 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: The value of size is 17.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of size is 17, and the value of sequence is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: size is 17, sequence is [16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], result is the return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates 17 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 16. For each iteration, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and then the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` is incremented by `result`. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations, the sequence is effectively reversed during the loop's execution.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 34, where size is 17 and result is the final return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer within the range [1, 1000], and `sequence`, a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. It returns either 0 or 34, where 34 is the final return value of `func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)` when the size is 17.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns 34, where size is 17 and result is the final return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
