### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to achieve this using a recursive function `func_1`.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the size of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by appending values from 0 to `size-1`, and then adjusting these values based on the remaining number.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns 0, indicating no further adjustments are needed.

4. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` helps determine the maximum size of the sequence.
   - This ensures that the sequence can accommodate the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - Values from 0 to `size-1` are appended to the sequence.
   - The sequence is then adjusted by adding the result of a recursive call to handle the remaining number.

6. **Adjustments**:
   - The adjustments ensure that the sequence maintains the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - Assertions are used to validate the correctness of the adjustments.

7. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed.
   - The sequence is printed as space-separated integers.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the required number of increasing subsequences is not achievable by returning -1.

### Verification:

- The logic for generating the sequence seems sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem.
- The use of bit manipulation and recursive adjustments appears to correctly compute the necessary sequence.
- The assertions in the code help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It generates an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences or returns -1 if it's not possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
