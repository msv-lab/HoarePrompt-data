Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `size`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This expression checks if the value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is a bit manipulation expression. It calculates \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\).
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` must be true.

4. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `size` is 1.
   - We need to determine the value of `(1 << size + 1) - 1` when `size` is 1.
   - When `size` is 1, `(1 << size + 1) - 1` becomes `(1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`.

5. **Determine the required state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `3` must be less than or equal to `number`.
   - Therefore, `number` must be at least 3.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`size` is 1 and `number` must be at least 3**
