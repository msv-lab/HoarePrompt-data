    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates 17 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 16. For each iteration, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and then the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` is incremented by `result`. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations, the sequence is effectively reversed during the loop's execution.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 34, where size is 17 and result is the final return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer within the range [1, 1000], and `sequence`, a list of integers. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of numbers and modifies the `sequence` list, ultimately returning either 0 or 34, where 34 is the final return value of a recursive call to `func_1` with updated parameters. The final state of the `sequence` list will be reversed and contain values from 0 to 16.
