Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer within the range [1, 1000], and `sequence`, a list of integers. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of numbers and modifies the `sequence` list, ultimately returning either 0 or 34, where 34 is the final return value of a recursive call to `func_1` with updated parameters. The final state of the `sequence` list will be reversed and contain values from 0 to 16.**
