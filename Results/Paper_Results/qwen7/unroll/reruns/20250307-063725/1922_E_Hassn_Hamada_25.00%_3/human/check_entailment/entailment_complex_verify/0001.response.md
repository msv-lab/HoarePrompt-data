### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to achieve this using a recursive function `func_1`.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the size of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by appending values from 0 to `size-1`, and then adjusting these values based on the remaining number.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns 0, indicating no further adjustments are needed.

4. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` helps determine the maximum size of the sequence.
   - This ensures that the sequence can accommodate the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - Values from 0 to `size-1` are appended to the sequence.
   - The sequence is then adjusted by adding the result of a recursive call to handle the remaining number.

6. **Adjustments**:
   - The adjustments ensure that the sequence maintains the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - Assertions are used to validate the correctness of the adjustments.

7. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed.
   - The sequence is printed as space-separated integers.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the required number of increasing subsequences is not achievable by returning -1.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is read from input.
  - `result` is initialized as an empty list.
  - `size` is calculated by calling `func_1(n - 1, result)`.

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - **Base Case**: If `number == 0`, it returns 0.
  - **Bit Manipulation**: Determines the size of the sequence by finding the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `number + 1`.
  - **Sequence Construction**: Appends values from 0 to `size-1` to the sequence.
  - **Recursive Call**: Adjusts the sequence by calling `func_1` with the remaining number and updates the sequence accordingly.

- **Assertions**:
  - The assertions in the code ensure that the sequence is constructed correctly and maintains the required number of increasing subsequences.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of Sequence Generation**:
  - The function correctly calculates the size of the sequence using bit manipulation.
  - The sequence is constructed by appending values from 0 to `size-1` and then adjusting them recursively.
  - The assertions validate the correctness of the adjustments.

- **Handling Edge Cases**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where the required number of increasing subsequences is not achievable by returning -1.

### Conclusion:

After carefully analyzing the code and the annotations, the provided program correctly solves the problem. It generates an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences or returns -1 if it's not possible.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
