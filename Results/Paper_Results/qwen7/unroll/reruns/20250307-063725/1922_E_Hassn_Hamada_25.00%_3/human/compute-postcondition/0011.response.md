Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `size`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `size`.
   - At the start of the loop, `i` should be 0, and `size` should be 17.

3. **Check the Given States**:
   - `size` is already given as 17.
   - `sequence` is a list and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)`, but this does not influence the loop execution either.

4. **Adjust the Required States**:
   - Since `i` is not mentioned in the initial state, it needs to be set to 0.
   - `size` is already correctly set to 17.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `size`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `size` must be 17**
