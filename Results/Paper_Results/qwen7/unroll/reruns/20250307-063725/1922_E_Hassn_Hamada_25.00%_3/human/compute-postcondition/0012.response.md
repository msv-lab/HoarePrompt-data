Output State: size is 17, sequence is [16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0], result is the return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)

Explanation: The loop iterates 17 times, and for each iteration, it checks the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1`. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the sequence, the condition will always hold true. During each iteration, the element at the index `-(result + i + 1)` in the sequence is incremented by `result`. Since `result` starts as the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)`, and the sequence is initially `[0, 1, 2, ..., 16]`, after all iterations, the sequence will be reversed, resulting in `[16, 15, 14, ..., 0]`.
