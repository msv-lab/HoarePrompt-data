Output State: **number is an integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]; the function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence.**

The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function that generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence. However, the actual implementation of the function is not provided, so no changes are made to the variables `number` and `sequence`. The precondition remains the same, and the function's behavior is described in the docstring.
