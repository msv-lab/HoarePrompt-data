Output State: **`size` is 1**

The initial state defines that `number` is an integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence` is a list of integers with elements in the range of \([-10^9, 10^9]\). The code initializes `size` to 1. Since no further operations are performed on `size` or any other variables, the only change is that `size` is set to 1. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
