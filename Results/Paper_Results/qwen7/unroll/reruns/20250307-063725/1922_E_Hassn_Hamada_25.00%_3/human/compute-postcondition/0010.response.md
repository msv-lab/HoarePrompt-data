Output State: **`size` is 17, `sequence` is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)`**.

The value of `size` remains unchanged at 17. The list `sequence` also remains unchanged. The variable `result` is assigned the return value of the function call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. Since the actual return value of `func_1` is not specified, it is represented as the return value of the function call.
