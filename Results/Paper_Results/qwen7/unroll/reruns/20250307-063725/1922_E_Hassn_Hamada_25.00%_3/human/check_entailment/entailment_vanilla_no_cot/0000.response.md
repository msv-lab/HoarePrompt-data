Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Increasing Subsequences:**
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that results in a specific number of increasing subsequences, but its logic is flawed.
   - The approach used in `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic for generating the sequence and adjusting values to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences is incorrect.

2. **Handling of Test Cases:**
   - The main loop reads test cases and processes each one. However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly compute the required sequence for each test case.
   - The sequence generation and validation steps are not implemented correctly, leading to incorrect outputs for many test cases.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program fails to handle edge cases such as when `X` is very small or very large. For instance, when `X` is 2, the expected output is `[0]`, but the program incorrectly prints `[1]`.

4. **Assertions and Logic Errors:**
   - The assertions within `func_1` are not meaningful and do not help in ensuring the correctness of the sequence generation.
   - The logic for adjusting values in the sequence to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences is incorrect and leads to invalid sequences.

To correctly solve this problem, a different approach is needed. One possible solution involves using a combination of combinatorial mathematics and dynamic programming to generate the sequence that meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
