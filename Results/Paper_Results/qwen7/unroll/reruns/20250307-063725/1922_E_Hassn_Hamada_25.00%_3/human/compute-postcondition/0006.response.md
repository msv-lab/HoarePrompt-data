Output State: **The value of size is 17.**

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `size` as long as the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` holds true. Here, `1 << size + 1` is equivalent to `2^(size + 1) - 1`. If we assume `number` is a very large number, the loop will keep incrementing `size` until the expression exceeds `number`. For typical integer values, if `number` is sufficiently large, `size` will be incremented to the point where `2^(size + 1) - 1` just exceeds `number`. Without a specific `number`, we can't give an exact final value, but for the sake of this example, if `number` is such that the loop runs until `size` reaches 17, then the output state would be that `size` is 17.
