You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates 17 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 16. For each iteration, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and then the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` is incremented by `result`. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations, the sequence is effectively reversed during the loop's execution.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 34, where size is 17 and result is the final return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer within the range [1, 1000], and `sequence`, a list of integers. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it generates a sequence of numbers and modifies the `sequence` list, ultimately returning either 0 or 34, where 34 is the final return value of a recursive call to `func_1` with updated parameters. The final state of the `sequence` list will be reversed and contain values from 0 to 16.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The provided solution attempts to achieve this using a recursive function `func_1`.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the size of the sequence.
   - The sequence is built by appending values from 0 to `size-1`, and then adjusting these values based on the remaining number.

3. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns 0, indicating no further adjustments are needed.

4. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` helps determine the maximum size of the sequence.
   - This ensures that the sequence can accommodate the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - Values from 0 to `size-1` are appended to the sequence.
   - The sequence is then adjusted by adding the result of a recursive call to handle the remaining number.

6. **Adjustments**:
   - The adjustments ensure that the sequence maintains the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - Assertions are used to validate the correctness of the adjustments.

7. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed.
   - The sequence is printed as space-separated integers.

8. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the case where the required number of increasing subsequences is not achievable by returning -1.

### Verification:

- The logic for generating the sequence seems sound and aligns with the requirements of the problem.
- The use of bit manipulation and recursive adjustments appears to correctly compute the necessary sequence.
- The assertions in the code help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It generates an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences or returns -1 if it's not possible.

### Correctness:
**True**
