Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze whether it correctly generates an array with a specified number of increasing subsequences, as per the problem statement. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and modify the `sequence` list.
   - It uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

2. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - The function uses bitwise operations to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - Specifically, it constructs a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences can be calculated using the properties of binary numbers.

3. **Recursive Construction**:
   - The function recursively builds the sequence by appending values and adjusting indices to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.
   - The final sequence is constructed such that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - If the sequence is not possible to construct, it prints `-1`.

Given the execution summary, the function `func_1` appears to correctly generate a sequence that matches the requirements. The summary indicates that the final state of the `sequence` list is reversed and contains values from 0 to 16, which aligns with the expected behavior of generating a sequence with a specific number of increasing subsequences.

Therefore, the provided program seems to be correct based on the given problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
