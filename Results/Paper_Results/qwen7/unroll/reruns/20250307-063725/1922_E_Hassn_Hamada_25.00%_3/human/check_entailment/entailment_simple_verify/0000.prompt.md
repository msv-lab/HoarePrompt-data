You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #Explanation: The loop iterates 17 times, with `i` ranging from 0 to 16. For each iteration, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and then the element at index `-result - i - 1` in the `sequence` is incremented by `result`. Given the initial conditions and the nature of the operations, the sequence is effectively reversed during the loop's execution.
    return size + result
    #The program returns 34, where size is 17 and result is the final return value of func_1(number - (1 << 17) + 1, sequence)



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence, but it does not ensure that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`. 

For instance, consider the input `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence, but it does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not cover all necessary cases to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

A correct solution would involve generating a sequence that can be manipulated to produce the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `X`. The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
