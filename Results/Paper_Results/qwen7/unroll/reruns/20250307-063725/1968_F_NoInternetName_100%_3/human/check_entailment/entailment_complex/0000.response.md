Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly reads a line of space-separated integers and converts them to a list of integers using the provided `cast` function. This is essential for processing input data.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the smallest index in the array `arr` that satisfies the predicate. If no such index exists, it returns the length of the array. However, the function does not seem to be used in a way that directly impacts the correctness of the overall solution. Its primary role seems to be supporting other functions.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function simply calls `func_2` and returns its result. Since `func_2` is not used in a critical manner, `func_3` is also not essential for the correctness of the solution.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function calls `func_2` and returns the index incremented by one if `func_2` returns a non-None value. Otherwise, it returns `None`. Similar to `func_3`, this function's role is not critical to the main logic of the solution.

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function is the core of the solution. It calculates the cumulative XOR of the array and stores the indices where each cumulative XOR value appears. For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR values at the specified range boundaries match or if there is a zero value within the range. The logic here is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the problem description. All functions work together to achieve the intended functionality without any logical errors or omissions.

Correctness: **True**
