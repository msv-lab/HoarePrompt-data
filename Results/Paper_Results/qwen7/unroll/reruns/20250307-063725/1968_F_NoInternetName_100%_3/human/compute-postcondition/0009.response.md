Output State: **The output state will consist of 'Yes' or 'No' printed for each query based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each query (i) in the range of q, if either of the following conditions is met:
1. The elements at positions l-1 and r in list x are equal.
2. There exists an index in the range [l, r] where the cumulative XOR operation results in 0 and the upper bound is greater than the lower bound.**

This means that for each query, the program checks if the specified conditions are satisfied and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
