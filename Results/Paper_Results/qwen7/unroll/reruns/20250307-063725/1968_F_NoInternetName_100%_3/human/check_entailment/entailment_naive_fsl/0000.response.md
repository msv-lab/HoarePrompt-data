Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the XOR condition holds, but this approach is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect XOR Calculation**: The program uses `x[l-1]` and `x[r]` to check if the subarray is interesting. However, `x[r]` represents the XOR of the entire subarray from the start to index `r`, which is not useful for checking the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r`.

2. **Incorrect Binary Search Usage**: The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are used to find indices where certain conditions hold, but these functions are not correctly applied to the problem. The binary search is not appropriately used to find valid splits within the subarray.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic to determine if the subarray is interesting is not correctly implemented. The program should check if there exists a way to split the subarray into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is the same. The current implementation does not correctly handle this logic.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Example Input:**
```
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output for all cases. For instance, for the query `1 5`, the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` is indeed interesting as shown in the problem statement. The program should correctly identify this, but due to the flaws in the logic, it may fail to do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
