Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of integers using cumulative XOR operations and then handles `q` queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it checks if the elements at positions `l-1` and `r` in the cumulative XOR list `x` are equal or if there exists an index within the range `[l, r]` where the cumulative XOR operation results in 0. If either condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function takes two positive integers `n` and `q` (with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 * 10^5), a list `a` of integers (each in the range [0, 2^30]), and for each query, two more positive integers `l` and `r` (with constraints 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function does not return any value but prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each query.**
