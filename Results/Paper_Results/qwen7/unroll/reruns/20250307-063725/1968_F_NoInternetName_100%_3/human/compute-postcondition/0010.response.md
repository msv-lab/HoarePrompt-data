Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and q, where 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. It also accepts a list a of integers, where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), and two positive integers l and r for each query, where 1 <= l < r <= n. The function processes q queries, each defined by l and r, and returns the result of each query.**

This means the function takes a list of integers `a` and performs `q` queries on this list. Each query specifies a range `[l, r]` within the list, and the function returns the result of processing this range for each query.
