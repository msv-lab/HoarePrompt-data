You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list `a` of integers using cumulative XOR operations and then handles `q` queries. For each query defined by indices `l` and `r`, it checks if the elements at positions `l-1` and `r` in the cumulative XOR list `x` are equal or if there exists an index within the range `[l, r]` where the cumulative XOR operation results in 0. If either condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function takes two positive integers `n` and `q` (with constraints 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2 * 10^5), a list `a` of integers (each in the range [0, 2^30]), and for each query, two more positive integers `l` and `r` (with constraints 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n). The function does not return any value but prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of values from each part are equal.
   - The solution uses prefix XOR to efficiently check this condition.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray from `l` to `r` is zero, then the subarray can always be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
   - For other cases, the solution checks if there exists a split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Converts input strings to integers using `map`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Binary search implementation to find the first element satisfying a predicate.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Alias for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** Adjusts the binary search result to get the index plus one.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** Main function to solve the problem:
     - Reads `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes prefix XOR values.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks:
       - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero (indicating it can be split into two equal parts).
       - If there exists a valid split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for checking if the subarray can be split into equal XOR parts is sound.
   - The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient computation.
   - The code handles edge cases correctly, such as when the XOR of the entire subarray is zero.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" according to the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
