Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query.**

Explanation: The code `n, q = func_1(int)` calls a function `func_1` with an integer argument (though the exact implementation of `func_1` is not specified, we know it returns two values, `n` and `q`). These two values are assigned to `n` and `q`. The conditions on `n` and `q` remain the same as they were initially. The other variables (`a`, `l`, and `r`) are not affected by this line of code.
