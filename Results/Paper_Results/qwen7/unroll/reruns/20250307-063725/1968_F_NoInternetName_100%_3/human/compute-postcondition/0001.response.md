Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `a` is now the result of calling `func_1(int)`**.

Explanation: The code `a = list(func_1(int))` calls the function `func_1` with an argument of type `int`. The result of this function call is converted to a list and assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from their initial state.
