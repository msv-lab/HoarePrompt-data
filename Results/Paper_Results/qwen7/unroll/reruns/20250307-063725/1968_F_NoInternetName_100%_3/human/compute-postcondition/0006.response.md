Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list of length `n + n - 1` (since `x.append(x[-1] ^ i)` appends `n` elements to the initial element 0), where each element is the result of the XOR operation between the previous element and the corresponding element from the list `a`. `inds[0]` contains the list `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]` because the initial value of `x` is `[0, 0^a[0], 0^a[0]^a[1], ...]` and the XOR of any prefix with itself results in 0. All other lists in `inds` contain their respective indices in `x` where the value matches the key.
