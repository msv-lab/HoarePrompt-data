Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` with the default factory set to `list`. This means that `inds` is now a dictionary-like object where any key that does not exist will automatically be mapped to an empty list. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
