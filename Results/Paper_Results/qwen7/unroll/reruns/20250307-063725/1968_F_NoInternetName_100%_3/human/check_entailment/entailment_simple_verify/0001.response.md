### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of values from each part are equal.
   - The solution uses prefix XOR to efficiently check this condition.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray from `l` to `r` is zero, then the subarray can always be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
   - For other cases, the solution checks if there exists a split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Converts input strings to integers using `map`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Binary search implementation to find the first element satisfying a predicate.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Alias for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** Adjusts the binary search result to get the index plus one.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** Main function to solve the problem:
     - Reads `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes prefix XOR values.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks:
       - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero (indicating it can be split into two equal parts).
       - If there exists a valid split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

4. **Detailed Evaluation:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** This function correctly converts input strings to integers using `map`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** This function performs a binary search to find the first element that satisfies the predicate. However, the implementation has a logical error. The variable `mid` should be used to update `l` or `r` based on the predicate, but the current implementation updates `l` only if the predicate is satisfied, which may lead to incorrect results.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** This function is just an alias for `func_2`, so it is correct.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** This function adjusts the binary search result to get the index plus one. It is correct.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** This function reads the input and computes the prefix XOR values. It then uses the dictionary `inds` to store indices of each prefix XOR value. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero. If not, it uses binary search to find valid split points. However, the implementation of `func_2` might lead to incorrect results due to the logical error mentioned above.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for checking if the subarray can be split into equal XOR parts is sound.
   - The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient computation.
   - However, the implementation of `func_2` might lead to incorrect results due to the logical error in updating `l` and `r`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has a logical error in the implementation of `func_2` which might lead to incorrect results. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
