Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list containing the single element 0; `inds[0]` contains the element 0 appended to it.**

In this output state, the defaultdict `inds` has been updated such that the key `0` now contains a list with the element `0` appended to it. All other variables retain their initial conditions as described in the initial state.
