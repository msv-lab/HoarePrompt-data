### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if a subarray is "interesting," meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the XOR of values from each part are equal.
   - The solution uses prefix XOR to efficiently check this condition.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If the XOR of the entire subarray from `l` to `r` is zero, then the subarray can always be divided into two parts with equal XOR values.
   - For other cases, the solution checks if there exists a split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`):** Converts input strings to integers using `map`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`):** Binary search implementation to find the first element satisfying a predicate.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`):** Alias for `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`):** Adjusts the binary search result to get the index plus one.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`):** Main function to solve the problem:
     - Reads `n` and `q`.
     - Reads the array `a` and computes prefix XOR values.
     - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices of each prefix XOR value.
     - For each query, checks:
       - If the XOR of the entire subarray is zero (indicating it can be split into two equal parts).
       - If there exists a valid split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for checking if the subarray can be split into equal XOR parts is sound.
   - The use of prefix XOR and binary search ensures efficient computation.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for determining if a subarray is "interesting." Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the case where the subarray can be split into more than two parts.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The code only checks if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero or if there exists a split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point. This logic is insufficient to guarantee that the subarray can be divided into `k` parts with equal XOR values.

- **Example Counter-Example:**
  - Consider the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 0]`. The XOR of the entire subarray is `1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 0 = 0`. This means the subarray can be split into two parts with equal XOR values, but it can also be split into three or four parts with equal XOR values.
  - For instance, splitting it into `[1, 2]` and `[3, 0]` works, but so does splitting it into `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, and `[0]`.

- **Function 5 Logic:**
  - The function `func_5` does not correctly implement the logic to find multiple valid split points. It only checks for a single split point where the XORs of the left and right parts match the overall XOR up to that point.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "interesting" according to the problem statement. It fails to handle the case where the subarray can be split into more than two parts with equal XOR values.
