You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the XOR condition holds, but this approach is flawed. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Incorrect XOR Calculation**: The program uses `x[l-1]` and `x[r]` to check if the subarray is interesting. However, `x[r]` represents the XOR of the entire subarray from the start to index `r`, which is not useful for checking the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r`.

2. **Incorrect Binary Search Usage**: The functions `func_3` and `func_4` are used to find indices where certain conditions hold, but these functions are not correctly applied to the problem. The binary search is not appropriately used to find valid splits within the subarray.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic to determine if the subarray is interesting is not correctly implemented. The program should check if there exists a way to split the subarray into `k` parts such that the XOR of each part is the same. The current implementation does not correctly handle this logic.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

**Example Input:**
```
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

However, the provided program does not produce the correct output for all cases. For instance, for the query `1 5`, the subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` is indeed interesting as shown in the problem statement. The program should correctly identify this, but due to the flaws in the logic, it may fail to do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
