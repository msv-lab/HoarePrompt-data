### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1` correctly parses the input and converts it to the appropriate data types.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` are essentially the same function, both implementing a binary search to find the smallest index satisfying a given predicate.
   - `func_4` adjusts the result of `func_2` by adding 1 if the result is not `None`.
   - `func_5` correctly parses the input for the array and the queries, and constructs the prefix XOR array `x` and the dictionary `inds`.

2. **Prefix XOR Array Construction**:
   - The prefix XOR array `x` is constructed correctly, where each element `x[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - The dictionary `inds` is populated correctly, storing the indices where each unique value in `x` appears.

3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program checks if `x[l-1]` equals `x[r]`, which would mean the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - If not, it uses binary search to find the smallest index `lower` in `inds[x[r]]` that is less than `l` and the largest index `upper` in `inds[x[l-1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.
   - If `upper` is greater than `lower`, the subarray is considered interesting.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately, ensuring that the program works within the specified limits.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.
