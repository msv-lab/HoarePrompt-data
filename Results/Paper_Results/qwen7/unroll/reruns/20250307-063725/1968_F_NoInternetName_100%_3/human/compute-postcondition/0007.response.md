Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list where each element is the result of XORing the previous element with the corresponding element from list `a`, and `inds[0]` contains a list of indices where the value 0 appears in list `x`. Each index in `inds[0]` corresponds to the position in list `x` where the cumulative XOR operation results in 0.
