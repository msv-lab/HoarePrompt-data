Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, `x` is a list where each element is the result of XORing the previous element with the corresponding element from list `a`, and `inds[0]` contains a list of indices where the value 0 appears in list `x`. Each index in `inds[0]` corresponds to the position in list `x` where the cumulative XOR operation results in 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
    if upper > lower:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
