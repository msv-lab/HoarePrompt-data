Output State: `bipartite` is now a boolean value determined by the `dfs` function calls, `n` is the same input integer, `y` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `x` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `r` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `True` or `False` based on whether the corresponding node was visited during the `dfs` calls, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` based on whether the corresponding node was part of the initial condition in the loop, `tot` is now `0`, `ok` is now `True` if any `dfs` call resulted in a bipartite graph with a non-zero total, otherwise `False`.
