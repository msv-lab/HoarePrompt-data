Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; x, y, and r are lists of length n; visited, coef, and tot are lists or integers as before; bipartite is a boolean variable as before.**

This means that the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from the user, while the lengths and types of the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef`, and the variable `tot` remain unchanged. The variable `bipartite` remains unaffected.
