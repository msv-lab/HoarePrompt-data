Based on the initial state provided:

- `bipartite` is a boolean value determined by the `dfs` function calls.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `y`, `x`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `True` or `False` based on whether the corresponding node was visited.
- `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` based on whether the corresponding node was visited and marked with a coefficient of `1`.
- `tot` is `0`.
- `ok` is `True`.

The `print('YES')` statement simply prints the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
