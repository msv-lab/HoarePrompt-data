Output State: **`bipartite` is now `True`, `n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `visited` is now a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `tot` is now 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is explicitly set to `True`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
