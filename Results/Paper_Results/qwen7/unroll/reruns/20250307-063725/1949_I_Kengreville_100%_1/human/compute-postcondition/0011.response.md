Output State: **`bipartite` is now `True`, `n` is an input integer, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `visited` is now a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `tot` is now 0, `ok` is now `False`.**

Explanation: The variable `ok` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
