Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `visited` is now a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `tot` retains its original state; `bipartite` retains its original state.**

Explanation: The code initializes `coef` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. All other lists (`y`, `x`, `r`, `visited`) remain unchanged, and `tot` and `bipartite` retain their original states.
