n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n, where for each i (0 ≤ i < n), x[i], y[i], and r[i] are integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and radius of the i-th disk respectively. visited is a boolean list of length n indicating whether each disk has been visited during the DFS process. coef is a list of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS process. tot is an integer used to count the number of connected components during the DFS process. bipartite is a boolean variable used to check if the current component is bipartite.
