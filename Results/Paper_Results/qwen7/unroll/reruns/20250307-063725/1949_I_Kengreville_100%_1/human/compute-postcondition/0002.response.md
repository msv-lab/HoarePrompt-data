Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` is a list of length `n`; `visited`, `coef`, and `tot` are lists or integers as before; `bipartite` is a boolean variable as before.**

Explanation: The code initializes `y` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
