Output State: `n` is assigned the value of the input integer, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer obtained from the input; `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer obtained from the input; `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer obtained from the input; `visited` is now a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `tot` retains its original state; `bipartite` retains its original state.
