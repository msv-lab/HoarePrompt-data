Output State: `bipartite` is now a boolean value determined by the `dfs` function calls, `n` is the same input integer, `y` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `x` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `r` is the same list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `True` or `False` based on whether the corresponding node was visited, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` based on whether the corresponding node was visited and marked with a coefficient of `1`, `tot` is now `0`, `ok` is now `True` if any `bipartite` is `True` and `tot` is not `0` for the nodes visited during the DFS, otherwise `False`.
