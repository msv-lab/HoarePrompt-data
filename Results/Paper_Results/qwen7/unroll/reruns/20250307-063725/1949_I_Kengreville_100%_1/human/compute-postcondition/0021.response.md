Functionality: **The function processes a set of disks represented by their coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on these disks to determine if any connected component forms a bipartite graph and if there are any non-zero connected components. If any connected component is found to be bipartite and contains more than one disk, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.**
