Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of the input integer, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer input from the user, `visited` is now a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `tot` is now 0, `bipartite` retains its original state.**

Explanation: The variable `tot` is assigned the value 0. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
