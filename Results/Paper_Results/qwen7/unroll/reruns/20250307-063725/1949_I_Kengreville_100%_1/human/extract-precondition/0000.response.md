Precondition: **`i` is an integer such that `0 <= i < n`, where `n` is the number of disks. The variables `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively. The variable `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized with either 1 or -1, and `visited` is a list of length `n` initialized with `False`. The variable `tot` is an integer used to accumulate the coefficients during the DFS traversal, and `bipartite` is a boolean variable used to check if the graph formed by the tangency conditions is bipartite.**
