Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `visited` is now a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite` retain their original states.**

Explanation: The line `visited = [False] * n` creates a new list called `visited` of length `n`, where each element is set to `False`. All other variables (`y`, `x`, `r`, `coef`, `tot`, and `bipartite`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
