Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and each of the next n - 1 lines contains two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n representing an edge in the tree, after executing the loop all t sets of input data have been processed by the function solve().
