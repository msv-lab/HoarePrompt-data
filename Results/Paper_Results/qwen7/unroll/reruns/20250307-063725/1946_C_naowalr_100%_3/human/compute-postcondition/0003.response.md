Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by t sets of input data. Each set includes two integers n and k (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5) and n - 1 lines, each containing two integers v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ n) representing edges in a tree. The function returns nothing directly but processes this tree structure and its properties based on the given inputs.**
