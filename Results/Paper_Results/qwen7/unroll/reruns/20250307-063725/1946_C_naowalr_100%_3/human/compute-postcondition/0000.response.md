Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   The loop head is `for _ in range(int(sys.stdin.readline())):`. The only variable involved here is the loop counter, which is `_`. However, since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (it's not used inside the loop), we don't need to adjust its value.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   The loop will execute as long as `int(sys.stdin.readline())` returns a positive integer. Given the initial state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means `sys.stdin.readline()` will return a valid integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   Since the loop depends on the input from `sys.stdin.readline()`, we need to ensure that the input is within the expected range. The initial state already provides that `t` is between 1 and \(10^4\), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the given initial state.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
