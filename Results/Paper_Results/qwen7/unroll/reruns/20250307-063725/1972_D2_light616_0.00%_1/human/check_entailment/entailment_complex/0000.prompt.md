Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the square root of n is less than or equal to the maximum possible value derived from the conditions (x + y) * x ≤ n and (x + y) * y ≤ m.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: cnt is the sum of the minimum values of \( \frac{n}{(x+y)x} \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor \) for all pairs of integers (x, y) where \( x \) starts from 1 and increments by 1, and \( y \) starts from 1 and increments by 1 until \( (x+y)x > n \) or \( (x+y)y > m \), with the condition that \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \).
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of the minimum values of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\) for all valid (x, y) pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the sum of the minimum values of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\) for all pairs of integers (x, y) where \(x\) starts from 1 and increments by 1, and \(y\) starts from 1 and increments by 1 until \((x+y)x > n\) or \((x+y)y > m\), with the condition that \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\).

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and it has been used to control the number of iterations in the loop. After the loop executes all the iterations, no other variables are affected by the loop, so their states remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then calls another function `func_1()` `t` times. After processing all test cases, it does not modify any variables and simply returns when the loop completes.
