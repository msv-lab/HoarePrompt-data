You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then calls another function `func_1()` `t` times. After processing all test cases, it does not modify any variables and simply returns when the loop completes.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) to check if the conditions are met.
   - It ensures that \( x \leq \sqrt{n} \) and \( y \) is incremented until the product \( (x + y) \cdot x \) or \( (x + y) \cdot y \) exceeds the respective limits.
   - For each valid pair, it checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, and then calculates the minimum value of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \) to count the number of valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
