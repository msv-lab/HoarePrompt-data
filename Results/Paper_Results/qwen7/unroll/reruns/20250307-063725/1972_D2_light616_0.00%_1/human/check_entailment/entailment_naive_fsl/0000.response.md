Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) to check if the conditions are met.
   - It ensures that \( x \leq \sqrt{n} \) and \( y \) is incremented until the product \( (x + y) \cdot x \) or \( (x + y) \cdot y \) exceeds the respective limits.
   - For each valid pair, it checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \( x \) and \( y \) is 1, and then calculates the minimum value of \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \) to count the number of valid pairs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
