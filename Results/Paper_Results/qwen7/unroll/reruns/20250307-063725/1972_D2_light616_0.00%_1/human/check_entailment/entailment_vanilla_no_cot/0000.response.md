Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Conditions:**
   - The condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly handled in the nested loops. Specifically, the logic inside the loop where it checks `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` and then uses `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is flawed. This approach does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. **Loop Conditions:**
   - The outer loop `while x * x <= n:` and inner loop `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:` are not appropriate for the problem constraints. These conditions do not ensure that all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the given ranges are checked.

3. **GCD and Multiples Check:**
   - The check `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is unnecessary and does not contribute to solving the problem correctly. The problem does not require `gcd(a, b)` to be 1; any valid pair `(a, b)` should be considered.

4. **Counting Valid Pairs:**
   - The method `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect. It does not properly count the number of valid pairs. Instead, it should iterate over all possible values of `b` for each `a` and check the condition directly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This version correctly iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition for each pair.
