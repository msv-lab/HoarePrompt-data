Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and m.**

This means the function does not directly accept any parameters but seems to handle multiple test cases internally, each containing specific ranges of integers t, n, and m, and provides output based on these values.
