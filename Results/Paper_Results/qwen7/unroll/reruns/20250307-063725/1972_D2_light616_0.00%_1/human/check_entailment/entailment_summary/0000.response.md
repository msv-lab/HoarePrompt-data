Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions.
- The given code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's verify the correctness of `func_1` and `func_2`:

1. **func_1**:
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It checks the condition \(x \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It ensures \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - It counts the valid pairs using the formula \(\min\left(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}, \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\right)\).

2. **func_2**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1` \(t\) times.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases without modifying any variables outside the loop.

Given the execution summaries and the logic within the functions, both functions seem to correctly implement the solution for the problem. They handle the constraints and conditions appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
