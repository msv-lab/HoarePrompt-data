State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, _ is not a variable that needs adjustment as it is a dummy variable in the loop head**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` which is a dummy variable used to iterate over the range of `t`.
- The only variable that can be adjusted from the given state is `t`, which must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive for the loop to execute.
- The dummy variable `_` does not need to be adjusted as it is not used outside the loop and its value is not relevant for the loop's execution condition.
