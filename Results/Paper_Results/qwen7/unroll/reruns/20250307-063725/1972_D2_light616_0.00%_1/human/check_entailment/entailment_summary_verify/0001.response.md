### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect due to the use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` in the `func_1` function, which does not accurately count the number of valid pairs. Let's re-evaluate the program using the provided function summary and the problem description.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- **Function `func_1`**: Calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
- **Function `func_2`**: Reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly count the number of valid pairs, we need to ensure that for each pair \((x, y)\), the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) holds true. However, the current implementation uses division and floor division, which do not accurately reflect the count of valid pairs.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \mod (a + b) = 0\) simplifies to checking if \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\) and ensuring that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - The current implementation uses `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which is incorrect. Instead, we should directly check the condition and increment the count if it holds true.

#### Corrected Implementation:
We need to revise the `func_1` function to correctly count the number of valid pairs. Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        for y in range(1, m + 1):
            if (x + y) != 0 and (y * math.gcd(x, y)) % (x + y) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
```

With this corrected implementation, the program should correctly count the number of valid pairs for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The given program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed counting mechanism in `func_1`. The revised implementation provided above should correctly solve the problem.

**Final Evaluation:**
Final: **False**
