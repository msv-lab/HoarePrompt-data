You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of the minimum values of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\) for all valid (x, y) pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the sum of the minimum values of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\) for all pairs of integers (x, y) where \(x\) starts from 1 and increments by 1, and \(y\) starts from 1 and increments by 1 until \((x+y)x > n\) or \((x+y)y > m\), with the condition that \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\).

#Function 2:

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and it has been used to control the number of iterations in the loop. After the loop executes all the iterations, no other variables are affected by the loop, so their states remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then calls another function `func_1()` `t` times. After processing all test cases, it does not modify any variables and simply returns when the loop completes.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq n\) and \(1 \leq y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \((x + y) \cdot \gcd(x, y)\) is a multiple of \(x + y\).
   - If these conditions are met, it adds the minimum of \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\) to the count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the program processes multiple test cases correctly.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \((x + y) \cdot \gcd(x, y)\) being a multiple of \(x + y\) simplifies to checking if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This is because if \(\gcd(x, y) > 1\), then \((x + y) \cdot \gcd(x, y)\) cannot be a multiple of \(x + y\).

2. **Count Calculation**:
   - The code calculates the number of valid pairs by iterating over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking the gcd condition.
   - The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but this approach might not be accurate. Specifically, the division and floor division operations might not correctly count the number of valid pairs.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - The nested loops iterate up to \(\sqrt{n}\) for \(x\) and then up to \(m\) for \(y\), which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement with the given function:

- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - No pairs \((a, b)\) exist, so the output should be `0`.
- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), so the output should be `1`.
- **Test Case 3**: \(n = 3\), \(m = 5\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), so the output should be `1`.
- **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs: \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\), so the output should be `6`.
- **Test Case 5**: \(n = 100\), \(m = 1233\)
  - The output should be `423`.
- **Test Case 6**: \(n = 1000000\), \(m = 1145141\)
  - The output should be `5933961`.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and verifying the examples, we find that the logic in `func_1` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is incorrect and does not accurately count the number of valid pairs.

Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.
