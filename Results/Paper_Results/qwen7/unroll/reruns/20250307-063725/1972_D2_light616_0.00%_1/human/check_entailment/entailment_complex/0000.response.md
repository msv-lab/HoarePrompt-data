Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function iterates through all pairs of integers `(x, y)` starting from `(1, 1)` up to the point where either `(x + y) * x > n` or `(x + y) * y > m`. For each pair, it checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1. If true, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to the count `cnt`. This count is then printed at the end of the function.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. It ensures that for each test case, the values of `n` and `m` are correctly processed according to the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in both functions appears to be consistent with the requirements. Function 1 correctly calculates the number of valid pairs for a single test case, and Function 2 correctly processes multiple test cases.

Since both functions work together to process each test case correctly and the provided examples match the expected outputs, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
