### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts from 1 and increments up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - `y` starts from 1 and increments until the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) are no longer satisfied.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of valid pairs.

2. **Inner Loop**:
   - For each fixed \( x \), `y` is incremented until the conditions are violated.
   - If \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\), the program calculates the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This value is added to `cnt`.

3. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop continues until \( x \cdot x \leq n \).

4. **Output**:
   - The final value of `cnt` is printed, which represents the number of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Output**:
   - Each test case's result is handled by `func_1`, and the results are not stored or combined; they are simply printed one by one.

#### Annotations and Validation:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly checks the conditions and updates `cnt` as required.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases.

#### Edge Cases and Constraints:
- The constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) are handled appropriately.
- The program does not fail due to overflow or other arithmetic issues within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
