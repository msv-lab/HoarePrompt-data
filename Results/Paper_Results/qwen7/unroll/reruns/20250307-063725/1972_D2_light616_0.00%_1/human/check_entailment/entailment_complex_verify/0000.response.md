### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts from 1 and goes up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of valid pairs.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs as long as \( x \times x \leq n \).
   - The inner loop runs as long as \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).
   - For each valid pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the GCD condition is satisfied, it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \times x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor\) to `cnt`.

3. **Termination**:
   - The loops terminate when either \((x + y) \times x > n\) or \((x + y) \times y > m\).
   - The final value of `cnt` is printed.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - No additional state is modified after the loop.

#### Key Points to Validate:
1. **GCD Check**:
   - The GCD check ensures that \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\). This is crucial because the problem requires pairs where the GCD is 1.

2. **Bounds Check**:
   - The bounds \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\) ensure that the pairs \((a, b)\) are within the specified ranges.

3. **Minimum Calculation**:
   - The minimum value calculation ensures that we count the number of valid pairs correctly.

#### Correctness Verification:
- The program correctly iterates over all possible pairs \((x, y)\) within the given constraints.
- The GCD check ensures that only coprime pairs are considered.
- The bounds check ensures that the pairs are within the specified ranges.
- The minimum value calculation correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
