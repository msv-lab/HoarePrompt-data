Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the sum of the minimum values of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \right\rfloor\) for all pairs of integers (x, y) where \(x\) starts from 1 and increments by 1, and \(y\) starts from 1 and increments by 1 until \((x+y)x > n\) or \((x+y)y > m\), with the condition that \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\).**
