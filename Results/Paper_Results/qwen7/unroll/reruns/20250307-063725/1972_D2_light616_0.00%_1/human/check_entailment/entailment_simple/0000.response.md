### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function iterates over all pairs `(x, y)` where `1 ≤ x ≤ \sqrt{n}` and `1 ≤ y ≤ m / (x + y)`.
   - For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` is 1.
   - If the GCD is 1, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to the count (`cnt`).

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This ensures that `func_1()` is called for each test case, and the results are correctly computed and printed.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - The logic in `func_2()` correctly handles multiple test cases and calls `func_1()` for each one.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the program correctly implements the solution. The logic in `func_1()` and `func_2()` aligns with the requirements and constraints specified in the problem.
