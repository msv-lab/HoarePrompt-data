Functionality: The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It calculates the side length of the square and prints the area of the square for each test case. The final state of the program is a series of printed outputs, each representing the calculated area of a square for each test case.
