Functionality: **The function accepts input through standard input, processing t test cases where each case consists of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function verifies if the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, returning a specific value based on the validation.**

This means the function does not take any direct parameters but reads input from the standard input. It processes up to 100 test cases, each defined by four lines of input, where each line contains two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function checks if these points indeed form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, and returns a result based on this check.
