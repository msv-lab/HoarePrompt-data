The function takes no input parameters directly, but the input is provided through standard input in the format described. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
