Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each value of `l`, `l` is an input integer for each iteration of the while loop.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an input integer and assigns it to `n`. This changes the value of `n` but does not affect the values of `s` or `l`. The initial state description for `s` and `l` remains unchanged because the code does not modify these variables. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the initial descriptions for `s` and `l`.
