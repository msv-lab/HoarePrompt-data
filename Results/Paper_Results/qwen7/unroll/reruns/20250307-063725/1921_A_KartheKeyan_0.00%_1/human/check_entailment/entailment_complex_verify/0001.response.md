### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Coordinate Reading**: The program reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`. This part is also correct.

3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The original assessment states that sorting the coordinates is unnecessary because the problem guarantees the points form a square with sides parallel to the axes. While sorting is not strictly necessary, it does not affect the correctness of the program. The program will still work correctly even without sorting, as the distances between adjacent points will be the same regardless of the order.

4. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two adjacent points. For a square with sides parallel to the axes, these distances should be equal and represent the side length squared. The distances calculated are:
   - \( p1 = (x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2 \)
   - \( p2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 \)

   Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the distances should be the same, and the correct distance calculation is:
   - \( \text{side}^2 = (x_1 - x_0)^2 \) (or any other pair of adjacent points along the same axis).

5. **Area Calculation**: The program calculates the square root of the distances and multiplies them, which is unnecessary. The correct area calculation should be:
   - \( \text{area} = \text{side}^2 \)

   However, the program calculates \( \sqrt{p1} \times \sqrt{p2} \), which simplifies to \( \sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2} \times \sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2} \). Given that both distances are the same (since the square's sides are parallel to the axes), this simplifies to \( \sqrt{\text{side}^2} \times \sqrt{\text{side}^2} = \text{side}^2 \), which is the correct area.

6. **Output**: The program prints the area for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct, although it includes an unnecessary step of calculating the square roots and multiplying them. The program still produces the correct result due to the guaranteed properties of the input. The complexity can be reduced, but the current implementation is still valid and correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct despite the unnecessary steps.
