Output State: **`n` is an input integer decreased by 1 after each iteration of the while loop; `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each value of `l`; `l` is an input integer for each iteration of the while loop.**

Explanation: The code starts by taking an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a while loop that runs `n` times. For each iteration, it takes an integer `l` as input, calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and prints the value of `s`. After each iteration, `n` is decremented by 1. The values of `l` and `s` are updated for each iteration, and `n` keeps track of the remaining iterations.
