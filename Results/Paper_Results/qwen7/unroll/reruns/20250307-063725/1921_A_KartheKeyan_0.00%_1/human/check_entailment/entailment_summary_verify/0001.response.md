### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Coordinate Reading**: The program reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`. This part is also correct.

3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The original assessment suggested that sorting the coordinates is unnecessary. While sorting is not strictly necessary for this problem, it does not affect the correctness of the program. The program will still work correctly even without sorting, as the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the axes.

4. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two adjacent points. For a square with sides parallel to the axes, these distances should be equal and represent the side length squared. The distances calculated are:
   - \( p1 = (x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2 \)
   - \( p2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 \)

   Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the distances should be the same, and the correct distance calculation is:
   - \( \text{side}^2 = (x_1 - x_0)^2 \) (or any other pair of adjacent points along the same axis).

5. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as \( \text{side}^2 \). The program calculates the square root of the distances and multiplies them, which is unnecessary. The correct area calculation should be:
   - \( \text{area} = \text{side}^2 \)

   However, the program calculates the square root of each distance and multiplies them together, which is equivalent to:
   - \( \text{area} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2} \times \sqrt{(x_3 - x_2)^2} = |x_1 - x_0| \times |x_3 - x_2| \)

   Given that the points form a square, the distances are equal, and thus:
   - \( \text{area} = (x_1 - x_0)^2 \)

   This simplifies to the correct area calculation.

6. **Output**: The program prints the area for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is correct, even though it includes an unnecessary step of calculating the square roots and multiplying them. The program still produces the correct result due to the guaranteed properties of the input. The original assessment was slightly overcritical in suggesting that the code is unnecessarily complex; the current implementation is logically sound and correct.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
