You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters directly, but the input is provided through standard input in the format described. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a list of results printed after each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, it takes four pairs of coordinates as input, sorts them, calculates the distances between specific points, and then computes the product of the square roots of these distances. The result is printed after each calculation. Since the loop runs `n` times, there will be `n` printed results, each representing the computed value for that particular iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts input through standard input, processing t test cases where each case consists of four lines with two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The function verifies if the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area, returning a specific value based on the validation.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
