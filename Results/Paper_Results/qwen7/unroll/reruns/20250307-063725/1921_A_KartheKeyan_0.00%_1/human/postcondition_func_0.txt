Functionality: The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It first sorts the coordinates, then calculates the distances between specific points, and finally computes the product of the square roots of these distances. The function prints the result for each test case, indicating whether the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
