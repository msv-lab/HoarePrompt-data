Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify Variables in the Loop Head
The loop head is `while n:`. The only variable involved here is `n`.

### Step 2: Determine the Condition for Loop Execution
The loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero (`n != 0`).

### Step 3: Analyze the Initial State
- `n` is an input integer.
- The initial state of `n` is given as "an input integer."

### Step 4: Determine Necessary Adjustments
For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is described as an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero.

### Conclusion
The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is not zero.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be non-zero**
