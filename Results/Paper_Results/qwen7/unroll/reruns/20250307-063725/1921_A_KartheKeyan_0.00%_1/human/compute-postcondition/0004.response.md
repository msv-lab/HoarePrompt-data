Output State: The output state will be a list of results printed after each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times. In each iteration, it takes four pairs of coordinates as input, sorts them, calculates the distances between specific points, and then computes the product of the square roots of these distances. The result is printed after each calculation. Since the loop runs `n` times, there will be `n` printed results, each representing the computed value for that particular iteration.
