### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Coordinate Reading**: The program reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `coord`. This part is also correct.

3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted, which is unnecessary since the problem guarantees the points form a square with sides parallel to the axes. Sorting can be skipped.

4. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distances between two adjacent points. For a square with sides parallel to the axes, these distances should be equal and represent the side length squared. The distances calculated are:
   - \( p1 = (x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2 \)
   - \( p2 = (x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2 \)

   Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the distances should be the same, and the correct distance calculation is:
   - \( \text{side}^2 = (x_1 - x_0)^2 \) (or any other pair of adjacent points along the same axis).

5. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as \( \text{side}^2 \). The program calculates the square root of the distances and multiplies them, which is unnecessary. The correct area calculation should be:
   - \( \text{area} = \text{side}^2 \)

6. **Output**: The program prints the area for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program logic has an unnecessary step of calculating the square roots and multiplying them, but it still produces the correct result due to the guaranteed properties of the input. However, the code can be simplified to directly calculate the side length squared.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The program is almost correct but unnecessarily complex. A simpler and more direct approach would be to calculate the side length squared directly without the extra steps.
