### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices` for each test case.
2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket price. This is done using a list comprehension and `heapq.heapify`.
3. **Main Loop**: The main loop runs until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`. Within this loop:
   - It pops the smallest price from the priority queue.
   - It calculates the effective price considering any previous price increases (`price_increase`).
   - It determines the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining number of tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - It updates the total cost by adding the product of the effective price and the number of tickets bought.
   - It increments the `tickets_bought` counter and updates the `price_increase` by the number of tickets bought.
4. **Return Statement**: The function returns the total cost after the loop completes.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given conditions. The use of a priority queue ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, and the logic for price increases and ticket limits is correctly handled within the loop.
