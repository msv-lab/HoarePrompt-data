Output State: **The state will be as follows: `pq` is an empty list (since all elements were popped), `total_cost` is the sum of the costs of buying up to `k` tickets with increasing prices, `tickets_bought` is equal to `k`, and `price_increase` is the total number of tickets bought.**

Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, all elements from the original heap `pq` have been processed, so `pq` becomes an empty list. The variable `total_cost` accumulates the cost of buying up to `k` tickets, with the ticket price increasing for each additional ticket bought due to the `price_increase` mechanism. The variable `tickets_bought` reaches `k` because the loop continues until `tickets_bought` is no longer less than `k`. The `price_increase` keeps track of the total number of tickets bought during the loop, which is added to the price of each subsequent ticket purchase.
