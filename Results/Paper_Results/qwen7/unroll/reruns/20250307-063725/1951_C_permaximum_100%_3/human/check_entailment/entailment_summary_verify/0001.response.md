### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to verify its correctness.

#### Input Processing:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices for each day.
3. It then calls the function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Priority Queue Initialization**:
   - The function initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with tuples containing the ticket prices and their corresponding indices.
   - This ensures that the cheapest available ticket is considered first.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.
   - For each iteration, it pops the cheapest ticket from the heap.
   - The price of the ticket is adjusted by adding the `price_increase` value, which represents the cumulative increase in price due to previous purchases.
   - The number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) is determined as the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
   - The total cost is updated by adding the current price multiplied by the number of tickets to buy.
   - The `price_increase` is updated by adding the number of tickets purchased.
   - The loop continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and logic as described in the problem statement.
   - It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are purchased on any single day.
   - The price increase mechanism is correctly applied to subsequent days.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program and the function `func_1` correctly implement the solution to the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and implements the solution accurately according to the problem statement.
