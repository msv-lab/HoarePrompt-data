Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap structure; `total_cost` is 0; `tickets_bought` is 0; `price_increase` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value `0` to the variable `price_increase`. This does not affect the values of `pq`, `total_cost`, or `tickets_bought`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
