The only variable in the loop head is `tickets_bought`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tickets_bought`. If `tickets_bought` is less than `k`, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `tickets_bought` is 0. For the loop to execute the first time, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted, but we need to ensure that `tickets_bought` is less than `k`.

State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap structure; `total_cost` is 0; `tickets_bought` is 0 and must be less than `k`; `price_increase` is 0**
