Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes the necessary variables and uses a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the ticket prices for each day.
2. **Heap Operations**: It uses the heap to efficiently get the day with the lowest current ticket price.
3. **Price Adjustment**: When purchasing tickets on a particular day, the price for all subsequent days increases by the number of tickets purchased on that day.
4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The program ensures that the number of tickets purchased per day does not exceed `m` and that the total number of tickets purchased equals `k`.
5. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is calculated by multiplying the adjusted price by the number of tickets purchased each day and summing these values.

Given the structure and logic of the code, it should correctly compute the minimum cost for purchasing `k` tickets across `n` days with the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
