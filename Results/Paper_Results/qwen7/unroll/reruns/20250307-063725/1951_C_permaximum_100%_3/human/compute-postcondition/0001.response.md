Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap structure.**

Explanation: The `heapq.heapify()` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place. A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property, which means that for any given node C, if P is a parent node of C, then the key (value) of P is smaller than or equal to the key of C. This transformation does not change the contents of the list but changes its structure to meet the heap property. The other variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
