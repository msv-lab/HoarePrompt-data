Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap structure; `total_cost` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `total_cost` to 0. This does not affect the heap structure of `pq`. Therefore, `pq` remains unchanged, and `total_cost` is set to 0.
