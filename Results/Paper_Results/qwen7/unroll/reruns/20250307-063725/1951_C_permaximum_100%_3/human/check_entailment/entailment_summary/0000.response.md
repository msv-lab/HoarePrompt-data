Reasoning:

1. **Function Parameters and Input Handling**: The function `func_1` correctly accepts the required parameters: `n` (number of sale days), `m` (maximum tickets purchasable each day), `k` (number of tickets to be bought), and `prices` (list of ticket prices for each day). This matches the problem description.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: The function initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket price. This ensures that the lowest price is always considered first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Heap Operations**: The function uses a heap to efficiently get the lowest price each iteration. This is done using `heapq.heappop`, which removes and returns the smallest element from the heap.

4. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: The function correctly calculates the number of tickets to buy each day (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`), ensuring it does not exceed the daily limit (`m`) or the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`). It also correctly updates the total cost and the price increase for subsequent days.

5. **Edge Cases**: The provided code handles edge cases such as when the number of tickets needed exceeds the product of `m` and `n`. The loop continues until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`, ensuring all necessary tickets are purchased.

6. **Output**: The function returns the total cost of purchasing the tickets, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
