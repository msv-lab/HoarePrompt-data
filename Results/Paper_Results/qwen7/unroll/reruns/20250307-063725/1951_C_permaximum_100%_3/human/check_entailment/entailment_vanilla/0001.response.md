Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices for each day.
3. It then calls the function `func_1` which is designed to calculate the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.
4. In `func_1`, the program uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the cheapest available ticket price first.
5. For each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`) which is the minimum of `m` and the remaining tickets needed (`k - tickets_bought`).
6. It then updates the total cost by adding the current price multiplied by the number of tickets to buy.
7. After purchasing the tickets, it increases the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets purchased.
8. The loop continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.
9. The program correctly handles the constraints and logic as described in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
