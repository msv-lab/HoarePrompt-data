Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraints given.
2. The function initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket price.
3. It uses a heap to efficiently get the day with the lowest current price.
4. For each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), updates the total cost, and increases the `price_increase` for subsequent days.
5. The logic within the function matches the problem description and ensures that the tickets are bought in such a way that the total cost is minimized.
6. The state analysis before and after the function call is consistent with the expected behavior of the function.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
