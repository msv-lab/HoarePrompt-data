Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, `n`, `m`, and `k` retain their original values.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of tuples, `pq`, where each tuple consists of a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index. The indices are generated using `enumerate(prices)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
