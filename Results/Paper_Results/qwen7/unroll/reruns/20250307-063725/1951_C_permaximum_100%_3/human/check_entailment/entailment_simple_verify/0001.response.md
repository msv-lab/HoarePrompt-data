### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices for each day.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a priority queue (min-heap) using the ticket prices and their corresponding indices.
   - It iteratively pops the smallest price from the heap, adjusts the price by the accumulated increase, and calculates the number of tickets to buy.
   - It updates the total cost and the number of tickets bought accordingly.
   - The price increase is updated after each purchase.
   - The loop continues until the required number of tickets (`k`) is bought.

3. **Heap Operations:**
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the cheapest available ticket is considered first, which aligns with the requirement to minimize the total cost.
   - The heap operations (push and pop) are efficient, ensuring that the overall complexity remains manageable.

4. **Price Increase Logic:**
   - The price increase logic correctly reflects the constraint that the price per ticket increases by the number of tickets purchased on any given day.
   - This ensures that the cost calculation is accurate and adheres to the problem constraints.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is less than `m` or when the number of days `n` is small.
   - The logic correctly manages the scenario where the required number of tickets can be bought within the first few days without exceeding the maximum limit `m`.

6. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.
   - The use of a min-heap ensures that the algorithm efficiently finds the optimal solution.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment accurately describes the functionality and correctness of the provided program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and accurately implements the solution to the problem.
