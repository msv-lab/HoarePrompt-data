Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its corresponding index, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap structure; `total_cost` is 0; `tickets_bought` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `tickets_bought` to 0. This does not affect the state of `pq` or `total_cost`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of `pq` being a heap and `total_cost` being 0, while adding that `tickets_bought` is now 0.
