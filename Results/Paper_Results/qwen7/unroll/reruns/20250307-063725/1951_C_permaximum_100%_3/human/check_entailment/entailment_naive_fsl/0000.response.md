Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) exceeds the product of the number of days (`n`) and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). In such cases, the program will incorrectly calculate the total cost because it does not account for the fact that once `k` tickets are bought, no further tickets can be purchased.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
5 10 15
1 2 3 4 5
```
Here, `n = 5`, `m = 10`, and `k = 15`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of tickets that can be bought is `nm = 50`, which is greater than `k = 15`. However, the program will still attempt to buy tickets beyond the available days, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program should ensure that it does not attempt to buy more tickets than the number of available days allow. Specifically, the loop should stop once the number of tickets bought reaches `k` or the number of days is exhausted.
