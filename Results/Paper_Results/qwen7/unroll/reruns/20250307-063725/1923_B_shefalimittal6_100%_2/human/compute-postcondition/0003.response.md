Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9), a (a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), and x (a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0). The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in the number of test cases, two integers `n` and `k` with specific ranges, a list of integers `a`, and another list of integers `x` with certain constraints. The exact nature of the return value is not specified in the provided information, but it implies that the function will process the lists `a` and `x` along with the integers `n` and `k` for each test case.
