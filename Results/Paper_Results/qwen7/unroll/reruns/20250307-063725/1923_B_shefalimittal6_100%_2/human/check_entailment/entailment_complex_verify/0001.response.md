### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's position (point 0).
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of firing bullets and checking if the player can survive.
   - The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It then iterates through these sorted indices, simulating the process of firing bullets.
   - For each group of monsters at the same distance, it checks if they can be killed before moving closer.
   - If at any point a monster reaches the player's position (distance 0), it returns `False`.

3. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - The sorting ensures that we handle the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival.
   - The logic of firing bullets and reducing their health correctly simulates the game mechanics.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where a monster can be killed by multiple bullets fired in the same second.

4. **Testing the Function:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is used to verify the correctness of the function.
   - The function passes all the examples given in the problem statement, indicating that it works as intended.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the game logic and checks if the player can survive.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and prints the result for each test case.

6. **Detailed Analysis of the Code:**
   - The function `func_1`:
     - Sorts the monsters by their distance from the player.
     - Iterates through the sorted indices, ensuring that the closest monsters are handled first.
     - Uses a `while` loop to simulate the firing of bullets and reduces the health of the monsters.
     - Checks if a monster reaches the player's position and returns `False` if it does.
     - Returns `True` if all monsters are defeated before any of them reach the player's position.
   - The function `func_2`:
     - Reads the input for each test case.
     - Calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
     - Prints the result ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem. They handle all the scenarios and examples given in the problem statement.
   - The logic and implementation in both functions are sound and correctly simulate the game mechanics.
