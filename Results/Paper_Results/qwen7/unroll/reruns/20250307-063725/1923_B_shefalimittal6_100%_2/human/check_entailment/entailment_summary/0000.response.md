Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**: This function correctly implements the logic to determine if all monsters can be defeated before reaching the player's position. It sorts the monsters by their distance from the origin and then attempts to reduce their health using the available bullets. If a monster's health can be reduced to zero before it reaches the player, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: This function handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly processes the input for each test case, extracts the necessary parameters (`n`, `k`, `a`, `x`), and then uses `func_1` to determine the outcome. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.

3. **Overall Program Logic**: The overall logic of the program matches the problem description. It processes multiple test cases, extracts the required parameters, and uses the correct method to determine if the player can survive and defeat all monsters.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
