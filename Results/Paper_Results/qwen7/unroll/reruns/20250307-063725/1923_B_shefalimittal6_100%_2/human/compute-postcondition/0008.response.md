Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns True if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given number of bullets per second, based on their positions and health. The function sorts the monsters by their distance from the origin, then attempts to fire bullets at them in order, reducing their health. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero using the available bullets, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.**
