### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (point 0).
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to simulate the process of firing bullets and checking if the player can survive.
   - The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It then iterates through these sorted indices, simulating the process of firing bullets.
   - For each group of monsters at the same distance, it checks if they can be killed before moving closer.
   - If at any point a monster reaches the player's position (distance 0), it returns `False`.

3. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - The sorting ensures that we handle the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival.
   - The logic of firing bullets and reducing their health correctly simulates the game mechanics.
   - However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
     - The function does not properly handle the scenario where multiple bullets can be fired at the same monster in the same second.
     - The function assumes that the player can always fire up to `k` bullets per second, but it does not account for the fact that bullets can be fired at different monsters simultaneously.
     - The function does not correctly handle the scenario where a monster can be killed by multiple bullets fired in the same second.

4. **Testing the Function:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is used to verify the correctness of the function.
   - Upon closer inspection, the example provided in the problem statement does not cover all edge cases. For instance, it does not check if the function correctly handles the scenario where a monster can be killed by multiple bullets fired in the same second.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the scenario where multiple bullets can be fired at the same monster in the same second.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and prints the result for each test case, but it relies on `func_1` which has logical flaws.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1` has logical flaws that prevent it from handling all scenarios correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
