### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `a` (health of monsters), `x` (positions of monsters), and `k` (number of bullets).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the player.
   - It then iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters, moving from the closest to the farthest.
   - The function checks if any monster reaches the player's position (point 0) and returns `False` if it does.
   - If no monster reaches the player, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
   - It calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if the player can survive.
   - Based on the result, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

3. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The main program calls `func_2()`, which processes each test case correctly.
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to handle the scenario where the player can fire bullets and move monsters appropriately to ensure no monster reaches the player.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the appropriate responses.

Given the descriptions and the logical flow, the program appears to correctly implement the rules of the game and determine whether the player can survive each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the logical flow of the functions.
