You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    -1 2 3

    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

    #State: The output state is such that the variable `distance` is incremented for each iteration of the outer while loop until either `rest` (the remaining bullets) becomes zero or `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`. For each inner while loop, the script fires up to `delta` bullets at the monster at index `sorted_indices[pos]`, reducing its health (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) accordingly. If a monster's health is reduced to zero, its index is skipped in the next iteration. The final value of `distance` will be the number of times the outer loop iterates before either `rest` runs out or all monsters are defeated.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly account for the movement of monsters towards the player after each second. The function assumes that monsters will only move towards the player if they are at the same distance as the current step, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, monsters move 1 point closer to the player every second, regardless of whether they are at the same distance as the current step.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  2 1
  1 1
  -1 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  NO
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The provided code incorrectly outputs `YES`.

In this case, the player has only 1 bullet and 2 monsters, both at a distance of 1 from the player. After firing the bullet, the second monster will still be at a distance of 1 from the player, and it will move to the player's position in the next second, resulting in the player losing. However, the provided code does not account for this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
