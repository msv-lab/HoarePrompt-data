Output State: **The output state is such that the variable `distance` is incremented for each iteration of the outer while loop until either `rest` (the remaining bullets) becomes zero or `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`. For each inner while loop, the script fires up to `delta` bullets at the monster at index `sorted_indices[pos]`, reducing its health (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) accordingly. If a monster's health is reduced to zero, its index is skipped in the next iteration. The final value of `distance` will be the number of times the outer loop iterates before either `rest` runs out or all monsters are defeated.**

This means that after the loop finishes, `distance` will represent how many times the process of firing bullets was attempted, and the list `a` will have been modified to reflect the health of each monster after all possible firings. Monsters with health reduced to zero will have their indices skipped in further iterations.
