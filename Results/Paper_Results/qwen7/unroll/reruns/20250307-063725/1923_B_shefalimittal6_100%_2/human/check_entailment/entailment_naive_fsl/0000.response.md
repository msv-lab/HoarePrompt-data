Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly account for the movement of monsters towards the player after each second. The function assumes that monsters will only move towards the player if they are at the same distance as the current step, which is incorrect. According to the problem description, monsters move 1 point closer to the player every second, regardless of whether they are at the same distance as the current step.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  2 1
  1 1
  -1 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  NO
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The provided code incorrectly outputs `YES`.

In this case, the player has only 1 bullet and 2 monsters, both at a distance of 1 from the player. After firing the bullet, the second monster will still be at a distance of 1 from the player, and it will move to the player's position in the next second, resulting in the player losing. However, the provided code does not account for this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect output.
