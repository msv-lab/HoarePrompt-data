You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0

    #State: The output state is such that the variable `distance` is incremented for each iteration of the outer while loop until either `rest` (the remaining bullets) becomes zero or `pos` reaches the length of `sorted_indices`. For each inner while loop, the script fires up to `delta` bullets at the monster at index `sorted_indices[pos]`, reducing its health (`a[sorted_indices[pos]]`) accordingly. If a monster's health is reduced to zero, its index is skipped in the next iteration. The final value of `distance` will be the number of times the outer loop iterates before either `rest` runs out or all monsters are defeated.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: a list of non-negative integers `a` representing the health of monsters, a list of integers `x` representing the initial positions of the monsters, and a non-negative integer `k` representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second. It returns True if it is possible to defeat all monsters using the given number of bullets per second, based on their positions and health. The function sorts the monsters by their distance from the origin, then attempts to fire bullets at them in order, reducing their health. If all monsters' health can be reduced to zero using the available bullets, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9; x is a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is the number of test cases executed, n and k are the last values read from the input for the current test case, a is the last list of integers read for the current test case, x is the last list of integers read for the current test case, the output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the evaluation of func_1(a, x, k).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), a list of integers \( a \), and another list of integers \( x \). It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to evaluate certain conditions. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (point 0).
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of firing bullets and checking if the player can survive.
   - The function `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It then iterates through these sorted indices, simulating the process of firing bullets.
   - For each group of monsters at the same distance, it checks if they can be killed before moving closer.
   - If at any point a monster reaches the player's position (distance 0), it returns `False`.

3. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - The sorting ensures that we handle the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival.
   - The logic of firing bullets and reducing their health correctly simulates the game mechanics.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where a monster can be killed by multiple bullets fired in the same second.

4. **Testing the Function:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is used to verify the correctness of the function.
   - The function passes all the examples given in the problem statement, indicating that it works as intended.

5. **Overall Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the game logic and checks if the player can survive.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes the input and prints the result for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the solution to the problem. They handle all the scenarios and examples given in the problem statement.
