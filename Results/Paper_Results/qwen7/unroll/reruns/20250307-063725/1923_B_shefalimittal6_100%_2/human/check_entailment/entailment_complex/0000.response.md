Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly sorts the monsters by their distance from the origin, which is crucial because it ensures that monsters closer to the player are dealt with first.
   - The function then iteratively reduces the health of the monsters using the available bullets (`k`). It checks if the monster's health can be reduced to zero and skips the monster if its health is already zero.
   - The function returns `True` if all monsters can be defeated before any of them reach the player (position 0).

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) and then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if the player can survive.
   - The output is correctly formatted as 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result of `func_1`.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
   - `func_1` ensures that the player can defeat all monsters before any of them reach the player.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and outputs the results based on the evaluations of `func_1`.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
