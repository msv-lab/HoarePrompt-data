Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `x` is a list of `n` integers where -`n` ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ `n` and x_i ≠ 0.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.
