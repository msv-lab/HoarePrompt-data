Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), a list of integers \( a \), and another list of integers \( x \). It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to evaluate certain conditions. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results of each test case.**
