### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `calculate_score` Analysis:
- The function `calculate_score` aims to compute the score for a single player given their starting position.
- It correctly handles the scenario where a cycle is detected and computes the score for the remaining steps within the cycle.
- However, the function only considers moving to `p[current_pos - 1]` and does not explicitly handle the scenario where a player can choose to stay at their current position.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores.
- If the scores are different, it returns the winner; otherwise, it returns "Draw".
- The issue lies in the fact that `calculate_score` does not fully simulate the game's rules, as mentioned in the original assessment.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input for multiple test cases and processes each test case using `func_1`.
- It correctly reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The function then prints the results for each test case.

#### Original Assessment Revisited:
- The original assessment correctly points out that the `calculate_score` function does not fully simulate the game's rules. Specifically, it does not handle the scenario where a player can choose to stay at their current position.
- The assessment also correctly notes that the function only considers moving to `p[current_pos - 1]`, which is not in line with the problem description.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for both players because it does not fully simulate the game's rules.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
