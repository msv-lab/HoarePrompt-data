### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `calculate_score` Analysis:
1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring:**
   - The function correctly identifies cycles and calculates the score within these cycles.
   - However, it does not fully account for the possibility of staying at the current position on each turn. The function assumes that a player will always move to `p[current_pos - 1]` unless a cycle is detected.

2. **Simultaneous Moves:**
   - The function simulates the game for one player at a time, which does not accurately represent the simultaneous moves of both players. Each player has the choice to either stay at their current position or move to `p[current_pos - 1]` on each turn.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores to determine the winner.
- The logic for determining the winner is correct, but it relies on the accuracy of `calculate_score`.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function reads input and processes multiple test cases.
- It correctly calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.

### Detailed Breakdown:
1. **Cycle Handling:**
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly handles cycles and calculates the score within these cycles.
   - However, it does not simulate the possibility of staying at the current position on each turn, which could lead to missed optimal scores.

2. **Simultaneous Moves:**
   - The function does not simulate the simultaneous moves of both players. It only considers one player's moves at a time, which is incorrect.

3. **Score Calculation:**
   - The score calculation is based on the assumption that a player will always move to `p[current_pos - 1]` unless a cycle is detected.
   - This assumption does not cover all possible strategies, especially when a player can choose to stay at their current position.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for both players because it does not fully account for the possibility of staying at the current position on each turn and does not simulate the simultaneous moves of both players.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the issues mentioned above.
