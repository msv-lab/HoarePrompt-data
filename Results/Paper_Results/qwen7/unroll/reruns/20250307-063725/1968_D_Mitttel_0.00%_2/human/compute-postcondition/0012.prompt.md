You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation; a is a list of n integers representing the array a.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 8 (since it starts from 2 and increments by 4 for each iteration), `t` is an integer from the list at position 0, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are integers or lists of integers determined during each iteration, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1` for each iteration.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: data is a list of strings, index is 8, t is an integer from the list at position 0, n, k, PB, PS, p, and a are integers or lists of integers determined during each iteration, results is a list containing the results of calling func_1 for each iteration, and no changes were made to the print statement inside the loop, so the loop simply prints each result in the results list without affecting any variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters including the number of test cases, constraints on n and k, indices PB and PS, a permutation list p, and an array a list a, without specifying the exact return value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
