Output State: **`cycle_length` is `steps - cycle_start`, `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1` with the indices wrapped around according to the array `p`, `cycle_pos` is `current_pos`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`.**

The code assigns the value of `k - steps` to the variable `remaining_steps`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged.
