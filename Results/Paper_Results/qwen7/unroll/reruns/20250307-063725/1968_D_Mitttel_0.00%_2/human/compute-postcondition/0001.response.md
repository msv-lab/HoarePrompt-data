Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input, `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `data = input().split()` reads a single line of input from the standard input (which is set to read from `sys.stdin`), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
