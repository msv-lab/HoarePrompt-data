The function `func_2` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`: a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n` and `k`: positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9.
- `PB` and `PS`: positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n.
- `p`: a list of n integers representing the permutation.
- `a`: a list of n integers representing the array a.

The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided output cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a set of parameters including the number of test cases, constraints on n and k, indices PB and PS, a permutation list p, and an array a list a, without specifying the exact return value in the given context.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters including the number of test cases, constraints on n and k, indices PB and PS, a permutation list p, and an array a list a, without specifying the exact return value.**
