Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function does not handle the scenario where a player can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p[current_pos - 1]` on each turn. Instead, it only considers moving to `p[current_pos - 1]` until a cycle is detected, which is not in line with the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible moves, leading to incorrect results.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Cycle Detection and Scoring:** The `calculate_score` function detects cycles but does not fully account for the possibility of staying at the current position. This means that the function might miss out on potential higher scores if a player chooses to stay at a position instead of moving to `p[current_pos - 1]`.

2. **Simultaneous Moves:** The problem description states that both players make moves simultaneously, but the current implementation does not properly simulate this behavior. The function only considers one player's moves at a time, which is not accurate.

To fix this, the program needs to properly simulate both players' moves simultaneously and ensure that the score calculation accounts for all possible choices (staying or moving) for each turn.
