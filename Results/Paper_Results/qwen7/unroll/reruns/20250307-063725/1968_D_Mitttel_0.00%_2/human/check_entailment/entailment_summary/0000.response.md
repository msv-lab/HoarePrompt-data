Reasoning:
1. The main function `func_2()` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It ensures that for each test case, the necessary parameters are extracted and passed to `func_1()`.
2. The `func_1()` function correctly calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score()` function. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
3. The `calculate_score()` function correctly computes the score for a given starting position. It handles both non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios appropriately, ensuring that the score is calculated accurately even when the player gets into a cycle.

Given the execution summaries and the logic in the code, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement. All functions work together to process each test case and determine the winner based on the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
