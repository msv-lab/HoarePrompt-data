Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `start_pos`, which is an integer representing the starting position (either P_B or P_S). It also accepts `n`, an integer representing the length of the permutation; `k`, an integer representing the duration of the game; `p`, a list of integers representing the permutation; and `a`, a list of integers representing the array a. The function calculates the final value of `score` based on the given rules and returns this score.**
