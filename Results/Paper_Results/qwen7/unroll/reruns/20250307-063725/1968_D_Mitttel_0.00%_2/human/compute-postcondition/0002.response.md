Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 0, `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of `data`, `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
