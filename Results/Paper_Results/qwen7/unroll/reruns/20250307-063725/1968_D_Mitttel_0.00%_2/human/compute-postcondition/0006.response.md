Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. This means the loop will execute `t` times.

2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Identify the states that need adjustment**: Since the loop depends on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state given is:
   - `data` is a list of strings split from the input.
   - `index` is 2.
   - `t` is an integer from the list at position 0.
   - `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
   - `results` is an empty list.

6. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`data`, `index`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, `a`, and `results`) do not affect the loop execution directly and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
