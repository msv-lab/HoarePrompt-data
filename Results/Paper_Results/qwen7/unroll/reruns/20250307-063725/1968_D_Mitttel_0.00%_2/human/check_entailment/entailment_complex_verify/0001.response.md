### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct as it directly uses the scores calculated by `calculate_score`.

2. **Function `calculate_score` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It handles two main scenarios:
     - **No Cycle**: If no cycle is detected within `k` steps, it simply adds up the scores for each step.
     - **Cycle Detection**: If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for one cycle and then determines how many full cycles fit into `k` steps and any remaining steps.
   - The logic for handling cycles is sound and correctly accounts for the periodic nature of the permutation.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each case.
   - It correctly parses the input and ensures that the input data is processed in the right order.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input string is a common technique for handling large inputs efficiently.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The overall structure of the program is correct. It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each case.
   - The functions are modular and handle different parts of the problem effectively.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a subtle issue with the way the scores are calculated for the cycle scenario. Specifically, the function `calculate_score` assumes that the cycle detection mechanism correctly identifies the cycle and its length. But the implementation of the cycle detection and subsequent score calculation might not handle all edge cases properly.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Cycle Detection**:
  - The function `calculate_score` uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles. However, the logic to update `current_pos` and `steps` might not handle all edge cases, especially when the permutation has complex cycles or when the cycle length is very close to `k`.

- **Score Calculation**:
  - The function correctly calculates the score for each step and handles the cycle scenario by breaking down the total steps into full cycles and the remaining steps. However, the implementation might not account for all possible permutations and their cycles accurately.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following permutation and array:
- Permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[10, 20, 30]`
- Starting positions: `P_B = 1`, `P_S = 2`
- Duration: `k = 2`

- **Bodya's Path**:
  - Start at position 1: Score = 10
  - Move to position 2: Score = 10 + 20 = 30

- **Sasha's Path**:
  - Start at position 2: Score = 20
  - Move to position 3: Score = 20 + 30 = 50

In this case, Sasha should win, but the current implementation might not handle this correctly due to the way the cycle detection and score calculation are implemented.

### Conclusion:
While the overall structure and logic of the program seem correct, the specific implementation of cycle detection and score calculation might not handle all edge cases accurately. Therefore, the original assessment might be slightly inaccurate due to potential edge cases not being fully accounted for.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
