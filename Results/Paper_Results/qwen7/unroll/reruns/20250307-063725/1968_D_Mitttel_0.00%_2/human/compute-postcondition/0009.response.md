Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The only variable here is `result`.

2. **Determine the State of `result`**: For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. This is because the loop iterates over each element in `results`.

3. **Adjust the States of Relevant Objects**: Since the loop depends on the `results` list having at least one element, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least one element.

Given the initial state:
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `index` is 8.
- `t` is an integer from the list at position 0.
- `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` are integers or lists of integers determined during each iteration.
- `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1` for each iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute, `results` must have at least one element.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`results` is a list that must have at least one element**
