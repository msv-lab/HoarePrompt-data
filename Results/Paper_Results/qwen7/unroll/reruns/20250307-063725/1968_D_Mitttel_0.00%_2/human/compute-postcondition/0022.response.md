Output State: **The program returns the final value of `score` as calculated by the given rules.**

This means that if `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, the program calculates the score based on the number of complete cycles (`full_cycles`), the score for each cycle (`cycle_score`), and the additional score for the remaining steps (`remainder_steps`). If `cycle_start` is equal to -1, the score remains unchanged.
