Postcondition: `score` is an integer. If `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, then `score` is updated by adding `full_cycles * cycle_score` where `full_cycles` is the number of complete cycles, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `(cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length)` to `(cycle_pos - 1)` with indices wrapped around according to the array `p`, and then adding the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `(current_pos - 1 - remainder_steps)` to `(current_pos - 1)` with indices wrapped around according to the array `p`. If `cycle_start` is equal to -1, `score` remains unchanged.
