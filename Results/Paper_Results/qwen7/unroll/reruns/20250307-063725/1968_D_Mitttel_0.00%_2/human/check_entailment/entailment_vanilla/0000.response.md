### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct as it directly uses the scores calculated by `calculate_score`.

2. **Function `calculate_score` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It handles two main scenarios:
     - **No Cycle**: If no cycle is detected within `k` steps, it simply adds up the scores for each step.
     - **Cycle Detection**: If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for one cycle and then determines how many full cycles fit into `k` steps and any remaining steps.
   - The logic for handling cycles is sound and correctly accounts for the periodic nature of the permutation.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each case.
   - It correctly parses the input and ensures that the input data is processed in the right order.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input string is a common technique for handling large inputs efficiently.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The overall structure of the program is correct. It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each case.
   - The functions are modular and handle different parts of the problem effectively.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
