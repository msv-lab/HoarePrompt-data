Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the score for both players based on their starting positions in the permutation. It uses the `calculate_score` function to get the score for a given starting position. The logic for handling cycles in the permutation is correct, ensuring that the score is accurately computed even if the players end up in a cycle.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function correctly computes the score for a given starting position. It handles both the case where a cycle is detected and the case where a cycle is not detected. The logic for calculating the score within a cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle is sound.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from stdin, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case. The logic for reading input and processing each test case is correct. The results are stored in a list and printed out correctly.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
