Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function.
3. The `calculate_score` function accurately computes the score for a given starting position, taking into account any cycles in the permutation.
4. The logic in `func_1` to compare the scores and return the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct.
5. The overall structure of the program matches the problem description and the sample input/output provided.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
