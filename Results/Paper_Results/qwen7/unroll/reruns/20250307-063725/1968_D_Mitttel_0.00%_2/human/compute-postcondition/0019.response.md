Output State: **full_cycles is remaining_steps // cycle_length, cycle_length is steps - cycle_start, cycle_score is the sum of elements in the array a from index (cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length) to (cycle_pos - 1) with the indices wrapped around according to the array p, cycle_pos is current_pos, remaining_steps is k - steps, remainder_steps is remaining_steps % cycle_length, score is score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum of elements in the array a from index (current_pos - 1 - remainder_steps) to (current_pos - 1) with the indices wrapped around according to the array p.**

This output state describes the final values of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop itself updates the `score` and `current_pos` based on the `remainder_steps`. The `score` is incremented by the sum of the elements in the array `a` from the position `(current_pos - 1 - remainder_steps)` to `(current_pos - 1)` with indices wrapped around using the array `p`.
