Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a; the function `input = sys.stdin.read` is assigned to the variable `input`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the built-in `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of any variables but affects how input is read from the standard input. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged.
