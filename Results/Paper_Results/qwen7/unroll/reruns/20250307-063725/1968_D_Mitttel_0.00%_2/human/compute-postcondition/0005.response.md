Output State: **`data` is a list of strings split from the input, `index` is 2, `t` is an integer from the list at position 0, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other changes are made to the existing variables, so their states remain as they were in the initial state.
