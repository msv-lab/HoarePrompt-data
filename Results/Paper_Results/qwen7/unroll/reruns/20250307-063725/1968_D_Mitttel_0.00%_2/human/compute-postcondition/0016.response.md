Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is `steps - cycle_start`, `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1` with the indices wrapped around according to the array `p`, `cycle_pos` is `current_pos`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the remainder of `remaining_steps` divided by `cycle_length` and assigns it to `remainder_steps`. The other variables (`full_cycles`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_start`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, and `remaining_steps`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
