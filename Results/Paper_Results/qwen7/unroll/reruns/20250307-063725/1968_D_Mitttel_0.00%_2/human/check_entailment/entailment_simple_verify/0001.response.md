### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores.
   - The logic in `func_1` is straightforward and correct.

2. **Function `calculate_score` Analysis**:
   - The function `calculate_score` correctly calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It handles both the scenario where no cycle is detected and the scenario where a cycle is detected.
   - The logic for handling cycles is sound and correctly accounts for the periodic nature of the permutation.
   - The function correctly updates the score based on the number of full cycles and the remaining steps.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each case.
   - It correctly parses the input and ensures that the input data is processed in the right order.
   - The use of `sys.stdin.read` and splitting the input string is a common technique for handling large inputs efficiently.
   - The function correctly appends the results of `func_1` to the `results` list and prints each result.

4. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The overall structure of the program is correct. It processes each test case independently and prints the result for each case.
   - The functions are modular and handle different parts of the problem effectively.
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem description.

### Annotations Validation:
- The annotations provided in the annotated version of the code match the actual behavior of the functions.
- The state transitions and the flow of execution are correctly described.
- The logic for calculating scores and determining the winner is consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the "Permutation game" based on the provided problem description. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the code.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
