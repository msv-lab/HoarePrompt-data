Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is `steps - cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1` with the indices wrapped around according to the array `p`, `cycle_pos` is `current_pos`, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`**.

Explanation: The code `score += full_cycles * cycle_score` adds the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score` to the current value of `score`. The other variables remain unchanged.
