Postcondition: `score` is the final value determined by the following rules:
- If `cycle_start` is not equal to -1, `full_cycles` is the number of complete cycles remaining, `cycle_length` is the length of the cycle, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `(cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length)` to `(cycle_pos - 1)` with indices wrapped around according to the array `p`, `cycle_pos` is the current position, `remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `remainder_steps` is the remainder when `remaining_steps` is divided by `cycle_length`. The `score` is updated to `score + full_cycles * cycle_score +` the sum of elements in the array `a` from index `(current_pos - 1 - remainder_steps)` to `(current_pos - 1)` with indices wrapped around according to the array `p`.
- If `cycle_start` is equal to -1, no changes are made to `score`.
