Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function calls `calculate_score` for both players but does not account for the fact that players can choose to stay at their current position or move to `p[x]` on each turn. The `calculate_score` function only calculates the score based on moving to `p[x]` every time, which does not reflect the game's rules accurately.

To fix this, the `calculate_score` function should consider both options (staying or moving) for each turn. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `calculate_score` function:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        # Calculate the score if staying at the current position
        stay_score = score + a[current_pos - 1]
        # Calculate the score if moving to p[current_pos]
        move_score = score + a[current_pos - 1]
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
        move_score += a[current_pos - 1]
        # Choose the better option
        score = max(stay_score, move_score)
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

This corrected function properly evaluates both staying and moving options at each step, ensuring the game's rules are followed accurately.
