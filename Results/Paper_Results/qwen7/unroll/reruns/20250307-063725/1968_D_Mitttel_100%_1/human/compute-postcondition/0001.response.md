Output State: **`mx` is 0**

The code initializes the variable `mx` to 0. This sets `mx` to a specific value without affecting the values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k`). Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `mx` and retains the initial states of the other variables.
