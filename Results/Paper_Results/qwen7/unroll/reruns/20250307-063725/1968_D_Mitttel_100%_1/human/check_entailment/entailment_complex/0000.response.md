Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It uses a while loop to simulate the game turns, updating the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) until either the position has been visited before or the game duration (`k`) reaches zero.
   - The function correctly updates `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times `a[s]`.
   - The function handles the game logic correctly, including staying at the current position or moving to the next position as per the permutation `p`.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly reads the input for each test case.
   - It adjusts the indices of the arrays `p` and `a` by subtracting 1, as the permutation and array indices should start from 0.
   - It calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha starting positions.
   - The result is determined based on the scores returned by `func_1` for both players, correctly identifying "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw" based on the comparison of the two scores.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - The use of `vis` list ensures that the same position is not revisited, preventing infinite loops.
   - The program processes each test case independently, ensuring that the results are accurate for each one.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to determine the winner of the game based on the provided starting positions and the rules of the game.

Correctness: **True**
