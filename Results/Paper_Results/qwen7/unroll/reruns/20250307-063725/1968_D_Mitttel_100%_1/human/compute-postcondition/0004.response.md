Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `not vis[s] and k > 0`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop condition are `vis[s]` and `k`.
3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the condition `not vis[s]` to be true, `vis[s]` must be `False`.
   - For the condition `k > 0` to be true, `k` must be greater than 0.

Given the initial state:
- `mx` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `cur` is 0 (not relevant to the loop condition).
- `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.

Since `vis[s]` is initially `False` (because all elements in `vis` are 0), the only variable that needs adjustment is `k`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
