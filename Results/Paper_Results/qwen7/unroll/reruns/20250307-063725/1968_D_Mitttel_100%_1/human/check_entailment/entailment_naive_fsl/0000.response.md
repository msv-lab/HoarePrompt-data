Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly simulate the moves and scoring for the players. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Simulation of Moves**: The function `func_1` only considers moving to the next position in the permutation and does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position. This means it does not fully simulate the rules of the game where a player can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.

2. **Missing Staying Option**: The function always moves to the next position in the permutation without considering the option to stay at the current position. This leads to an incorrect calculation of the maximum possible score for each player.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  - Bodya starts at position 3 and Sasha starts at position 2.
  - For Bodya:
    - First turn: Position 3, Score = 5 (stays at position 3).
    - Second turn: Position 3, Score = 5 + 5 = 10 (stays at position 3).
  - For Sasha:
    - First turn: Position 2, Score = 2 (moves to position 1).
    - Second turn: Position 1, Score = 2 + 7 = 9 (stays at position 1).

  Therefore, Bodya's final score is 10 and Sasha's final score is 9, so Bodya wins.

However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the scores and does not handle the staying option, leading to an incorrect result. Thus, the program is incorrect.
