### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), and `ps` (Sasha's starting position).
   - The permutation `p` and the array `a` are read and stored as lists.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions) to keep track of visited nodes.
   - It iterates while the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - During each iteration, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), and decrements the remaining turns (`k`).
   - It then updates the current position `s` to the next position in the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is higher, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the permutation might form cycles, ensuring that the player does not revisit the same position until all turns are used up.
   - The logic seems sound and should handle all given constraints and examples.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- The annotation mentions that `vis` is initialized as a list of zeros, but the code actually initializes it as a list of tuples containing zeros. This is a minor issue but does not affect the functionality since all elements are set to 0 immediately afterward.
- The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game for one player, updating the score and visiting nodes as needed.
- The comparison logic in the main loop is correct and ensures that the scores are compared accurately.

### Evaluation:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program handles the game logic and edge cases appropriately. The minor discrepancy in the initialization of `vis` does not impact the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately determines the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints.
