Output State: **`n` is the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game.**

Explanation: The line `n = len(p)` calculates the length of the list `p` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`a`, `s`, and `k`) remain unchanged.
