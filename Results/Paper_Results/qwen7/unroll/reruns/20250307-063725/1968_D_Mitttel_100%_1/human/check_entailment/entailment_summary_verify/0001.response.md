### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), and `ps` (Sasha's starting position).
   - The permutation `p` and the array `a` are read and stored as lists.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions) to keep track of visited nodes.
   - It iterates while the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - During each iteration, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), and decrements the remaining turns (`k`).
   - It then updates the current position `s` to the next position in the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is higher, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the permutation might form cycles, ensuring that the player does not revisit the same position until all turns are used up.
   - The logic seems sound and should handle all given constraints and examples.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a potential issue with the function `func_1`. Specifically, the function does not fully account for the possibility that a player might stay at their current position multiple times within a single turn. This could lead to an incorrect calculation of the maximum score.

### Detailed Analysis:

- In the function `func_1`, the player's score is updated by adding `a[s]` and then moving to the next position in the permutation `p`. However, the player can also choose to stay at the current position without moving to `p[s]`.
- The function only considers the scenario where the player moves to the next position in the permutation, but it does not account for the scenario where the player stays at the current position multiple times within a single turn.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

- Permutation: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[10, 20, 30]`
- Starting Position: `0`
- Turns: `2`

In this case, the function would calculate the score as follows:
- Turn 1: Stay at position 0, score = 10
- Turn 2: Move to position 1, score = 10 + 20 = 30

However, the player could potentially stay at position 0 for both turns, resulting in a score of 10 + 10 = 20.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_1` does not fully account for the possibility of staying at the current position multiple times within a single turn. This oversight could lead to incorrect calculations of the maximum score, thereby affecting the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` does not properly account for the possibility of staying at the current position multiple times within a single turn.
