Output State: **mx is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the sum of cur plus k times a[s], considering all iterations; cur is the sum of a[s] for all iterations; k is 0; s is the last index that was processed.**

In more detail:
- `mx` will be updated to the highest value it reaches during the loop, which is the maximum of its initial value (0) and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `cur` will accumulate the sum of `a[s]` for each iteration.
- `k` will be reduced by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0.
- `s` will be set to `p[s]` at the end of each iteration, eventually pointing to the last index that was processed before `k` becomes 0.
