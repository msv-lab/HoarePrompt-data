Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \).
   - It then reads the permutation \( p \) and the array \( a \).
   - It adjusts the indices of the permutation and array to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position \( s \) over \( k \) turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx`, `cur`, and `vis` to keep track of the maximum score, the current score, and visited positions, respectively.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game turns, updating the current score and checking if the position has been visited before.
   - The loop continues until either all positions are visited or \( k \) turns are completed.
   - The function returns the maximum score achievable from the starting position \( s \).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha using their respective starting positions.
   - It then compares the scores returned by `func_1` and prints the appropriate result based on the comparison.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the scores are equal (resulting in a draw) and where one player has a higher score than the other.

Given the above analysis, the program logic seems to be correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game for a given starting position and calculates the maximum score, and the main part of the program correctly compares these scores.

Correctness: **True**
