Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, who start at specific positions in a permutation and take turns moving according to the rules. Each player's score is incremented by the value at their current position, and they can choose to stay or move to the position specified by the permutation.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` simulates the game for a single player starting at position `s`.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns.
   - It keeps track of the maximum score (`mx`) that can be achieved.
   - It also keeps track of the current score (`cur`) and decrements the remaining turns (`k`).
   - The function correctly handles the movement and scoring according to the rules of the game.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes each test case by reading the necessary inputs.
   - It adjusts the indices of the permutation and array to be zero-based.
   - It calls `func_1` for both players' starting positions.
   - It compares the scores obtained from `func_1` and prints the result accordingly.

4. **Execution Summary Validation**:
   - The execution summary accurately describes how `func_1` works, which confirms the logic inside the function.
   - The main program correctly uses the function to determine the outcome of the game for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
