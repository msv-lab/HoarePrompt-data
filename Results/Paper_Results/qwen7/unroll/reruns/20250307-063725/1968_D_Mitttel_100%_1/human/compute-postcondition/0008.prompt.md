You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the array a, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, s is a list of integers representing the starting positions (P_B, P_S) for Bodya and Sasha, and k is a positive integer representing the duration of the game.
def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    mx = 0
    cur = 0
    vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
    while not vis[s] and k > 0:
        vis[s] = 1
        
        mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])
        
        cur += a[s]
        
        k -= 1
        
        s = p[s]
        
    #State: mx is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the sum of cur plus k times a[s], considering all iterations; cur is the sum of a[s] for all iterations; k is 0; s is the last index that was processed.
    return mx
    #The program returns mx, which is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the sum of cur plus k times a[s], considering all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers from 1 to n `p`, a list of integers `s` representing the starting positions, and a positive integer `k` representing the duration of the game. It returns the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times `a[s]` for all iterations.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns mx, which is the maximum value between its initial value (0) and the sum of cur plus k times a[s], considering all iterations.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
