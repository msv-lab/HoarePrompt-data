Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum possible score for a given starting position `s` over `k` turns. However, the logic inside the loop might not correctly simulate the game rules. Specifically, it only considers one path (staying or moving to the next position in the permutation) without considering the possibility of moving back to previous positions or staying in the same position multiple times.

2. **Edge Cases**: The provided solution assumes that the players will always follow the optimal path to maximize their scores, which might not be the case due to the constraints and the nature of permutations. The current implementation might miss some optimal paths, especially when the permutation allows for multiple valid moves.

3. **Input and Output Handling**: The code correctly reads the input and processes each test case, but the logic for determining the winner is based on the assumption that the players will always take the best possible path, which might not be accurate without a more detailed simulation.

To fix these issues, the `func_1` function needs to be revised to accurately simulate the game rules, considering all possible moves and states. Additionally, the main logic should ensure that both players' scores are calculated correctly and compared to determine the winner.

Here is a revised version of the `func_1` function and the main logic to address these issues:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

def func_1(a, p, s, k):
    n = len(p)
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(pos, remaining):
        if remaining == 0:
            return 0
        stay = a[pos] + dfs(pos, remaining - 1)
        move = a[pos] + dfs(p[pos], remaining - 1)
        return max(stay, move)
    
    return dfs(s, k)

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
        a[i] -= 1
    
    A = func_1(a, p, pb - 1, k)
    B = func_1(a, p, ps - 1, k)
    
    if A == B:
        print('Draw')
    elif A > B:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

This revised version uses dynamic programming with memoization (`@lru_cache`) to handle all possible moves and states, ensuring that the scores are calculated accurately.
