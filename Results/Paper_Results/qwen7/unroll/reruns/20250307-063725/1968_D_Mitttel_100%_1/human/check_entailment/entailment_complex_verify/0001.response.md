### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), and `ps` (Sasha's starting position).
   - The permutation `p` and the array `a` are read and stored as lists.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions) to keep track of visited nodes.
   - It iterates while the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - During each iteration, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), and decrements the remaining turns (`k`).
   - It then updates the current position `s` to the next position in the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is higher, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the permutation might form cycles, ensuring that the player does not revisit the same position until all turns are used up.
   - The logic seems sound and should handle all given constraints and examples.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the function `func_1`, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the function. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's rules. Here is why:

- In the function `func_1`, the variable `cur` accumulates the score for the current path taken by the player. However, the function only considers one path (the path determined by following the permutation `p` without any choice). This means it does not account for the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the next position in the permutation during each turn.
- The function `func_1` assumes that the player will always follow the permutation `p` and does not consider the option to stay at the current position, which is a crucial part of the game's rules.

To illustrate, let's consider the first test case from the example:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - `n = 4`, `k = 2`, `pb = 3`, `ps = 2`
  - `p = [4, 1, 2, 3]`
  - `a = [7, 2, 5, 6]`

The function `func_1` would calculate the score as follows:

- Starting at position 3 (Bodya):
  - Turn 1: Stay at position 3, score = 5
  - Turn 2: Move to position 2, score = 5 + 2 = 7

- Starting at position 2 (Sasha):
  - Turn 1: Move to position 1, score = 7
  - Turn 2: Move to position 4, score = 7 + 6 = 13

Clearly, the function `func_1` does not capture the full dynamics of the game, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
