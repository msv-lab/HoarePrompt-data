### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and processes each test case.
   - It then reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb` (Bodya's starting position), and `ps` (Sasha's starting position).
   - The permutation `p` and the array `a` are read and stored as lists.
   - The program adjusts the indices of `p` and `a` to be zero-based by subtracting 1 from each element.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions) to keep track of visited nodes.
   - It iterates while the current position `s` has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - During each iteration, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), and decrements the remaining turns (`k`).
   - It then updates the current position `s` to the next position in the permutation `p`.

3. **Comparison and Output**:
   - After calculating the scores for both players using `func_1`, the program compares the scores.
   - If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If Bodya's score is higher, it prints 'Bodya'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Sasha'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the permutation might form cycles, ensuring that the player does not revisit the same position until all turns are used up.
   - The logic seems sound and should handle all given constraints and examples.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given rules and constraints. There are no apparent errors or logical flaws in the code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
