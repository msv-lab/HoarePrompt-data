Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n(n-1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), and the graph is described by m edges, each represented by three integers u, v, and w where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6; the recursion limit is set to 10 ** 6.**

The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\), which does not change the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `u`, `v`, or `w`. It only affects how deep the recursion can go in the program. The initial conditions and constraints for `t`, `n`, `m`, and the edges of the graph remain unchanged.
