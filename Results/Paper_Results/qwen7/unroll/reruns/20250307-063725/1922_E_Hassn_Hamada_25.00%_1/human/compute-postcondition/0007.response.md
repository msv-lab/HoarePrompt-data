Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `size`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `size`. Therefore, the loop will start and continue as long as `size` is at least 1.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `size`**: Since the loop will increment `size` until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is greater than `number`, we need to ensure that `size` is initially set such that the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 > number` holds true after the loop starts.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can start, `size` must be set to a value where `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is greater than `number`. The smallest possible value for `size` that satisfies this condition can be found by solving the inequality.

Given that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` must be greater than `number`, let's find the minimum `size`:

- For `size = 0`: `(1 << 0 + 1) - 1 = (1 << 1) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0` (not greater than `number`)
- For `size = 1`: `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3` (greater than `number` if `number` is less than 3)

Therefore, the smallest `size` that ensures the loop can start is `1`.

5. **Final State Adjustment**: The initial state of `size` should be set to 1 to ensure the loop can start and execute.

**State:**
State: **`size` is 1**
