### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The provided solution attempts to use a recursive function to build such an array.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the size of the sequence needed.
   - The sequence is built by appending values and adjusting them recursively.

3. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` ensures that the sequence size is adjusted correctly.
   - The loop `for i in range(size)` appends values to the sequence.
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` adjusts the sequence values.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed such that it has the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The adjustments made in the recursive calls ensure that the final sequence meets the requirements.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop processes each test case, generating the sequence and printing its length and elements.
   - The sequence is printed using `' '.join(map(str, result))`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `X = 2`, the sequence `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).
   - For larger values of `X`, the sequence construction logic seems to handle the generation correctly.

7. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions in the code help ensure the correctness of the sequence construction process.

### Verification:

- The provided solution handles the generation of sequences for various values of `X` within the specified constraints.
- The recursive approach ensures that the sequence is built correctly to meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The output format matches the problem statement.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Sequence Generation for Larger Values of `X`**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all edge cases and may produce incorrect sequences for certain values of `X`.
   - For example, consider `X = 13`. The function should generate a sequence that has exactly 13 increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation may not always produce the correct sequence.

2. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions in the code are not sufficient to validate the correctness of the sequence generation for all possible values of `X`.

3. **Handling of Large `X` Values**:
   - The function `func_1` relies on bit manipulation to determine the size of the sequence, but this approach may not always produce the correct sequence for very large values of `X`.

### Conclusion:

Upon re-evaluation, the provided solution does not guarantee the correct generation of sequences for all possible values of `X`. While it works for some cases, it may fail for others due to the limitations in the recursive approach and the lack of comprehensive validation.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
