Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not handle all possible values of `X` correctly.

For instance, consider the input `X = 2`. According to the problem description, a valid array could be `[0]` since it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`). However, the program outputs `1` followed by `0`, which is not the simplest solution and does not cover all cases efficiently.

Additionally, the program fails to handle certain edge cases properly. For example, when `X = 37`, the program generates a sequence that does not necessarily produce exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The sequence generated might not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to generate sequences that explicitly meet the requirement for any given `X`. The current implementation does not guarantee this for all possible inputs.
