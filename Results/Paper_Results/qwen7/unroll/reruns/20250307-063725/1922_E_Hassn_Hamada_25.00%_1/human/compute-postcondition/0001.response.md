Postcondition: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000). It is currently 0, and `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). The function has generated a sequence of numbers based on the input number, and the size of the generated sequence is 0.**
