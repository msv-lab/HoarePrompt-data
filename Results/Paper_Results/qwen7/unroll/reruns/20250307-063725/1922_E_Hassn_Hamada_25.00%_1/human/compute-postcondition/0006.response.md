Output State: **The variable `size` will be incremented until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is greater than `number`.**

To explain this in more detail:
- The loop continues as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is less than or equal to `number`.
- `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is equivalent to \(2^{size+1} - 1\).
- This expression represents the largest value that can be represented with `size + 1` bits in binary form.
- Therefore, the loop increments `size` until it finds the smallest `size` such that \(2^{size+1} - 1 > number\).

In simpler terms, `size` will be the smallest integer such that the maximum value that can be represented with `size + 1` bits is just greater than `number`.
