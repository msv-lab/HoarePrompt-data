Output State: `size` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for each iteration `i` in the range `0` to `size-1`, and `result` remains unchanged.

To break it down further:
- The `size` variable does not change throughout the loop.
- The `sequence` list is modified such that for each `i` in the range `0` to `size-1`, the element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result`.
- The `result` variable remains the same after the loop completes.
