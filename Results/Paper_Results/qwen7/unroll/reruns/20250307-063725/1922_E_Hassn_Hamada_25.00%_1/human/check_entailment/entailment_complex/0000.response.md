Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The provided solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to construct a sequence that matches the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The base case is when `number == 0`, in which case it returns 0.
   - The function calculates the smallest `size` such that `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1` is just greater than `number`. This ensures that the sequence can generate the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - It then constructs a sequence of integers from 0 to `size - 1`.
   - A recursive call is made to handle the remaining part of `number` after subtracting `(1 << size) - 1`.
   - The sequence is updated by incrementing certain elements by the result of the recursive call.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to ensure that the sequence can generate the exact number of increasing subsequences required.
   - The recursive approach correctly handles the construction of sequences that meet the criteria.
   - The assertions in the code ensure that the indices being accessed are within bounds, although the exact values are not provided, the logic is sound.
   - The overall structure of the function aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
