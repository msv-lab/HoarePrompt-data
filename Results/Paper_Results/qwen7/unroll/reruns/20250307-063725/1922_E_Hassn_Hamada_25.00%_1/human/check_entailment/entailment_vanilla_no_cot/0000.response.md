Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Base Case Handling**: The base case handling in `func_1` is not properly managed. When `number` is 0, the function should return immediately, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

2. **Sequence Generation Logic**: The logic for generating the sequence in `func_1` is overly complex and does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The use of bitwise operations and assertions does not align with the problem requirements.

3. **Output Validation**: The program does not validate the output to ensure that the generated array indeed has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. It simply prints the generated sequence without checking its correctness.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be redesigned to correctly generate sequences that meet the problem constraints. A more straightforward approach would involve using combinatorial methods to construct the sequence directly, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the required value `X`.

Here is a conceptual outline of a correct solution:

1. **Identify the Required Sequence Length**: Determine the length of the sequence needed to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. **Construct the Sequence**: Use combinatorial methods to construct the sequence such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
3. **Validate the Output**: Ensure that the generated sequence meets the problem requirements before printing it.

Given the complexity of the problem, a detailed and correct implementation would require a more sophisticated algorithmic approach than the one provided.
