Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences, or report that it is impossible.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function aims to construct a sequence of integers that will yield the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The logic behind the function is based on binary representation and dynamic programming principles.
   - The function uses recursion to build the sequence and ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `n`.
   - The function correctly handles the base case when `number` is 0, returning 0.
   - The function calculates the appropriate `size` and constructs the initial part of the sequence.
   - The function recursively adjusts the sequence to ensure the correct count of increasing subsequences.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n = 2`, the function correctly outputs `[0]` because there is exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).
   - For larger values of `n`, the function constructs sequences that match the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - The function handles the case where it cannot form a valid sequence by returning `-1`.

Given the detailed analysis and the provided execution summary, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the required sequence for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
