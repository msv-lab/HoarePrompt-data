You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, sequence is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}).
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}), the function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence. The value of `number` is not 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: The variable `size` will be incremented until `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is greater than `number`.
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `size` is set such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, and `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size-1`.
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `size` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for each iteration `i` in the range `[0, size)`. The `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop iterates `size` times.
    #- For each iteration `i`, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and must hold true.
    #- If the condition holds, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `number`, `size`, `sequence`, and `result` are not provided, we can't give specific numerical values for the final state of `sequence`. However, the general structure of the output state is described above.
    return size + result
    #The program returns a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
