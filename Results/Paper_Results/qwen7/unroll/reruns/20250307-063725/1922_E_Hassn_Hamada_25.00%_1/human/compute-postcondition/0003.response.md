Postcondition: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}), the function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence. The value of `number` is not 0**
