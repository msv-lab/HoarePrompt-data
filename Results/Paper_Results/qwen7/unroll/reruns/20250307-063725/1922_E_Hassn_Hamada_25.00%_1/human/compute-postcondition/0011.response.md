Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(size)`. This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = size - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and increments by 1 in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be `0`.

3. **Determine the Value of `size`**: The value of `size` is such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`. This means `size` is already determined based on the condition involving `number`.

4. **Check the List `sequence`**: The list `sequence` contains integers from `0` to `size - 1`. This list remains unchanged during the loop execution.

5. **Check the Variable `result`**: The variable `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. This value is also determined before the loop starts and remains constant throughout the loop iterations.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i`, which should be `0`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 0, `size` is determined such that (1 << size + 1) - 1 is just greater than `number`, `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size-1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**
