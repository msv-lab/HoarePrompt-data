    #State: Output State: `size` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for each iteration `i` in the range `[0, size)`. The `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop iterates `size` times.
    #- For each iteration `i`, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and must hold true.
    #- If the condition holds, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `number`, `size`, `sequence`, and `result` are not provided, we can't give specific numerical values for the final state of `sequence`. However, the general structure of the output state is described above.
    return size + result
    #The program returns a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, appends a sequence of integers from 0 to `size-1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in `sequence` by the returned value from the recursive call and returns the final calculated value.
