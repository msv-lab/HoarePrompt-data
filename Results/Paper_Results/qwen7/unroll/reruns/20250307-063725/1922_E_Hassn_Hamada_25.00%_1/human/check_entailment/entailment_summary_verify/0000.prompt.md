You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1

    return size + result



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, appends a sequence of integers from 0 to `size-1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in `sequence` by the returned value from the recursive call and returns the final calculated value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not handle all possible values of `X` correctly.

For instance, consider the input `X = 2`. According to the problem description, a valid array could be `[0]` since it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`). However, the program outputs `1` followed by `0`, which is not the simplest solution and does not cover all cases efficiently.

Additionally, the program fails to handle certain edge cases properly. For example, when `X = 37`, the program generates a sequence that does not necessarily produce exactly 37 increasing subsequences. The sequence generated might not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

To ensure correctness, the program needs to generate sequences that explicitly meet the requirement for any given `X`. The current implementation does not guarantee this for all possible inputs.
