Output State: **`number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}); the function generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number and returns the size of the generated sequence.**

The provided code snippet is a docstring that describes the behavior of a function without actually executing any code. Therefore, no variables are updated or changed by this code. The precondition remains intact, and the function's purpose is described within the docstring.
