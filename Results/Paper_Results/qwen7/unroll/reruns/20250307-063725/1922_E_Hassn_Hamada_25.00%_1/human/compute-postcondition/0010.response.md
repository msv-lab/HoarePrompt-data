Output State: **`size` is set such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, `sequence` is a list containing integers from 0 to `size-1`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`**.

This means that the variable `size` remains unchanged, and the list `sequence` also remains the same. The variable `result` now holds the return value from the function call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
