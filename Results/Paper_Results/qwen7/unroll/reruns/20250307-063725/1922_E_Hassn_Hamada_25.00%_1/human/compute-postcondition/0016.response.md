Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, appends a sequence of integers from 0 to `size-1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in `sequence` by the returned value from the recursive call and returns the final calculated value.**
