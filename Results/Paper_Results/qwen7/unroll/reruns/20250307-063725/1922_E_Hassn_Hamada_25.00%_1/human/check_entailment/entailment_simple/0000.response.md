### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the total number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is exactly `n`.

2. **Base Case**: When `number == 0`, the function immediately returns `0`. This is a base case indicating that no additional elements need to be added to the sequence.

3. **Recursive Case**: For `number > 0`, the function uses a recursive approach to construct the sequence. It calculates the appropriate `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`. This ensures that the sequence can have exactly `number` increasing subsequences.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - A sequence of integers from `0` to `size-1` is appended to `sequence`.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with `number - (1 << size) + 1` and appends the result to the sequence.
   - Each element in the sequence is adjusted by adding the result of the recursive call to ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions in the code ensure that the indices being accessed are within bounds. Specifically, `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` ensures that the indices are valid.

6. **Final Return Value**:
   - The function returns the sum of `size` and the result of the recursive call, ensuring the total number of increasing subsequences matches `number`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly constructs a sequence that meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The recursive approach ensures that the sequence is built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences is precisely controlled.
- The assertions ensure that the indices used to modify the sequence are valid.

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program appears to be correct in generating a sequence with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
