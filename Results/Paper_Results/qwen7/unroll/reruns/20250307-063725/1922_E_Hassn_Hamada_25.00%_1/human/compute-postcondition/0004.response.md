Output State: **`size` is 1, `number` is an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and for each test case, `sequence` is a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18})**.

The code initializes the variable `size` to 1. This does not affect the values of `number` or the `sequence`. Therefore, the only change is that `size` is now 1.
