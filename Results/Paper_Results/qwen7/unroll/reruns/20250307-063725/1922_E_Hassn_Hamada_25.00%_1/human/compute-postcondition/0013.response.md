Output State: `size` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` is incremented by `result` for each iteration `i` in the range `[0, size)`. The `result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.

To break it down further:
- The loop iterates `size` times.
- For each iteration `i`, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and must hold true.
- If the condition holds, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.

Since the exact values of `number`, `size`, `sequence`, and `result` are not provided, we can't give specific numerical values for the final state of `sequence`. However, the general structure of the output state is described above.
