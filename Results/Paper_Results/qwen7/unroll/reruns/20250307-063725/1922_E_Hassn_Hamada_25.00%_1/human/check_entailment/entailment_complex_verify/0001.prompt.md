You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- The loop iterates `size` times.
    #- For each iteration `i`, the condition `-len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1` is checked and must hold true.
    #- If the condition holds, the element at index `-result - i - 1` in `sequence` is incremented by `result`.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `number`, `size`, `sequence`, and `result` are not provided, we can't give specific numerical values for the final state of `sequence`. However, the general structure of the output state is described above.
    return size + result
    #The program returns a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, an integer representing the number of test cases (1 ≤ number ≤ 1000), and `sequence`, a list of integers where each integer X satisfies (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}). It returns either 0 or a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`. If `number` is 0, the function immediately returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1` is just greater than `number`, appends a sequence of integers from 0 to `size-1` to `sequence`, and recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and `sequence`. After the recursive call, it increments specific elements in `sequence` by the returned value from the recursive call and returns the final calculated value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The provided solution attempts to use a recursive function to build such an array.

2. **Recursive Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the size of the sequence needed.
   - The sequence is built by appending values and adjusting them recursively.

3. **Bit Manipulation**:
   - The condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` ensures that the sequence size is adjusted correctly.
   - The loop `for i in range(size)` appends values to the sequence.
   - The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)` adjusts the sequence values.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed such that it has the desired number of increasing subsequences.
   - The adjustments made in the recursive calls ensure that the final sequence meets the requirements.

5. **Output Handling**:
   - The main loop processes each test case, generating the sequence and printing its length and elements.
   - The sequence is printed using `' '.join(map(str, result))`.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `X = 2`, the sequence `[0]` is generated, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).
   - For larger values of `X`, the sequence construction logic seems to handle the generation correctly.

7. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions in the code help ensure the correctness of the sequence construction process.

### Verification:

- The provided solution handles the generation of sequences for various values of `X` within the specified constraints.
- The recursive approach ensures that the sequence is built correctly to meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The output format matches the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program correctly generates an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
