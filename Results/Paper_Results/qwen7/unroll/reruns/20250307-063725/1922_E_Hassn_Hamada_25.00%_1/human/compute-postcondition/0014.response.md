Output State: **The program returns a value which is the sum of `size` and the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`.**

This means the program returns a value that is the sum of the initial `size` and the result of the function call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, where `number` and `sequence` are from the initial state.
