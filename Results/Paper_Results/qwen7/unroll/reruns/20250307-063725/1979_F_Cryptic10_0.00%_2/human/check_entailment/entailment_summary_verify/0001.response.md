### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Representation and Query Handling**:
   - The function `func_1(d)` correctly sends a query to the judge and processes the response. It returns the vertex `v` and its non-adjacent vertex `u` if `v` is not zero. If `v` is zero, it means no such vertex `v` exists with degree at least `d`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The function `func_2(n)` aims to construct a Hamiltonian path using the responses from the judge.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates over degrees from `n-1` down to 0. For each degree `d`, it queries the judge.
   - If the returned vertex `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

3. **Hamiltonian Path Validity**:
   - The logic ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once and forms a path.
   - Since the graph is initially complete and only \( n - 2 \) edges are removed, a Hamiltonian path always exists.
   - The algorithm correctly handles the removal of vertices and edges as specified by the judge's responses.

4. **Query Limitation**:
   - The function makes at most `n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The path is printed in the correct format, and the program flushes the output buffer after each query and the final path.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the path construction logic. Specifically, the function `func_2(n)` does not ensure that the path constructed is a Hamiltonian path. The current logic only ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, but it does not guarantee that the path is a Hamiltonian path (i.e., it does not pass through each vertex exactly once in a specific order).

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Degree-based Query**: The function `func_1(d)` correctly identifies the vertex `v` with the minimum degree and the non-adjacent vertex `u`. However, the choice of `v` based solely on degree might not lead to a Hamiltonian path.
- **Path Construction**: The function `func_2(n)` iterates over degrees from `n-1` down to 0, but it does not ensure that the path is a Hamiltonian path. The logic assumes that the first vertex found with a non-zero degree will always be part of the Hamiltonian path, which is not necessarily true.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider a graph with 4 vertices where the edges `(1, 2)`, `(2, 3)`, and `(3, 4)` are removed from the complete graph. The remaining edges are `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, and `(2, 4)`.

- Query `? 3`: Returns `1 0` (vertex 1 has the minimum degree and is not connected to vertex 4).
- Query `? 2`: Returns `4 2` (vertex 4 has the minimum degree and is not connected to vertex 2).
- Query `? 1`: Returns `2 3` (vertex 2 has the minimum degree and is not connected to vertex 3).

The path constructed would be `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3`, which is not a Hamiltonian path since it does not visit each vertex exactly once in a specific order.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided program does not guarantee that the constructed path is a Hamiltonian path. The logic only ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, but it does not ensure the correct order required for a Hamiltonian path.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
