Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and reads the response from the standard input.
   - It returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d`, and `u` is the vertex that `v` is not connected to (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
   - The function uses `sys.stdout.flush()` to ensure the query is sent immediately.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most `n` queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are added to the path.
     - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` and the non-connected vertex `u`.
     - If `v` is 0, it means no vertex with the current degree `d` was found, so it continues to the next degree.
     - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries by calling `func_1(d)` for decreasing values of `d` until it finds a valid vertex `v` with at least `d` connections.
   - This ensures that the vertex `v` is chosen with the minimum degree and the minimum number among those with the same degree.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program constructs the path by iteratively removing vertices with the minimum degree and ensuring that the path is constructed correctly.
   - By removing vertices with the minimum degree, the program ensures that the path remains valid and covers all vertices exactly once.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where no vertex with the current degree `d` is found by continuing to the next lower degree.
   - The program ensures that the path is constructed correctly by removing vertices and updating the set of remaining vertices.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most `n` queries. The program handles the queries and path construction as specified in the problem statement.
