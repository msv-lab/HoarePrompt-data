Output State: **The `path` list contains some vertices from 1 to n, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect any variables or change their values. It simply flushes the output buffer of the standard output stream, which means it ensures that all pending output is written to the terminal or file. Since no variables are modified by this operation, the initial state remains unchanged.
