Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly queries the graph for the next vertex in a Hamiltonian path starting from a given vertex `d`. It returns the next vertex `v` and the subsequent vertex `u` if `v` is not isolated. The function handles the case where `v` is 0, indicating that no such vertex exists, by continuing to the next iteration.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to construct a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the graph using `func_1`. It starts with all vertices in the `remaining_vertices` set and removes vertices from this set as they are added to the `path`. The loop continues until all vertices are included in the path. The function ensures that the path is constructed correctly by breaking out of the loop when a valid vertex `v` is found and added to the path.

3. **Overall Program Logic**: The program iterates over each test case, calling `func_2` with the number of vertices `n`. The function `func_2` constructs a Hamiltonian path and prints it. The logic seems sound and should work as intended within the constraints provided.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the specified interactive queries.

Correctness: **True**
