### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Representation and Query Handling**:
   - The graph is initially a complete graph minus \( n - 2 \) edges.
   - The function `func_1(d)` correctly sends a query to the judge and processes the response. It returns the vertex `v` and its non-adjacent vertex `u` if `v` is not zero. If `v` is zero, it means no such vertex `v` exists with degree at least `d`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The function `func_2(n)` aims to construct a Hamiltonian path using the responses from the judge.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It iterates over degrees from `n-1` down to 0. For each degree `d`, it queries the judge.
   - If the returned vertex `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

3. **Hamiltonian Path Validity**:
   - The logic ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once and forms a path.
   - Since the graph is initially complete and only \( n - 2 \) edges are removed, a Hamiltonian path always exists.
   - The algorithm correctly handles the removal of vertices and edges as specified by the judge's responses.

4. **Query Limitation**:
   - The function makes at most `n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The path is printed in the correct format, and the program flushes the output buffer after each query and the final path.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries and adheres to the constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
