The function accepts an integer `d` representing a vertex index in a graph with `n` vertices (where 0 <= d < n). It queries the graph to obtain the next vertex `v` in a Hamiltonian path starting from vertex `d`. After receiving `v`, it further queries the graph to get the subsequent vertex `u` in the path. The function then returns these two vertices `v` and `u`.
