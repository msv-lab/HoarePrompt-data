Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in a complete graph with \( n \) vertices from which exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed. We can query the graph to get information about the degrees of vertices and their connections.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(d)**: This function queries the graph for the next vertex in the Hamiltonian path starting from vertex `d`. It returns the next vertex `v` and the subsequent vertex `u` if `v` is connected to `u`.
   - **func_2(n)**: This function constructs a Hamiltonian path using the `func_1(d)` queries. It iterates over possible starting points `d` in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`) and uses `func_1(d)` to get the next vertices in the path until all vertices are included.

3. **Path Construction**:
   - In `func_2(n)`, the function initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices of the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to n.
   - It then enters a loop that continues until all vertices are included in the path (`remaining_vertices` is empty).
   - For each iteration, it tries to find a suitable starting vertex `d` and uses `func_1(d)` to get the next vertices `v` and `u`. If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Once a valid vertex `v` is found, the loop breaks, and the process repeats until all vertices are included in the path.

4. **Verification**:
   - The function `func_2(n)` correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path by ensuring that all vertices are included without repetition.
   - The use of `func_1(d)` queries is appropriate for finding the next vertices in the path.
   - The logic for breaking the loop when a valid vertex is found ensures that the path is constructed efficiently.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the algorithm to find a Hamiltonian path in the given graph.

Correctness: **True**
