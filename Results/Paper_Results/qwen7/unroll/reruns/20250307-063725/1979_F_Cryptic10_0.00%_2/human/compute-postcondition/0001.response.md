Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n.**

Explanation: The code initializes `remaining_vertices` as a set containing all integers from 1 to n (inclusive). This set represents all vertices that are yet to be included in the `path`. The values of `n` and `path` remain unchanged from the initial state.
