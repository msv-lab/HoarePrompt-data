### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its interaction with the graph to determine if it can indeed find a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Graph Structure**: The graph is a complete graph with \( n \) vertices minus exactly \( n - 2 \) edges.
2. **Query Functionality**: The function `func_1(d)` queries the graph to get the vertex with the minimum degree at least \( d \) and an adjacent vertex that is not connected to it.
3. **Path Construction**: The function `func_2(n)` constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively removing vertices with the smallest degrees and ensuring that the path is constructed correctly.

#### Analysis:
1. **Initial State**:
   - The program starts by calling `func_2(n)`, which initializes the `path` list and the `remaining_vertices` set.
   
2. **Query Process**:
   - For each \( d \) from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, the program calls `func_1(d)`.
   - If `v` (the vertex with the minimum degree at least \( d \)) is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to the path and removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - This process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

3. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The program ensures that it always selects the vertex with the minimum degree and, if necessary, the vertex with the minimum number among those not connected to the selected vertex.
   - By removing the selected vertex and its edges, the program effectively reduces the problem size.
   - Since the graph is complete minus \( n - 2 \) edges, the degree of each vertex is at least 1, and the program will always find a vertex to add to the path.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - The program iterates from \( d = n - 1 \) down to 0, ensuring that it progresses towards finding a Hamiltonian path.
   - Even if many vertices have low degrees initially, the program will eventually find a vertex to add to the path, and the removal of vertices ensures that the path construction remains feasible.

5. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most \( n \) queries, as it iterates from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, and each query either adds a vertex to the path or skips to the next \( d \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path within the allowed \( n \) queries. It ensures that it always progresses towards constructing the path and handles the graph structure appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and can find a Hamiltonian path within \( n \) queries for any valid input graph.
