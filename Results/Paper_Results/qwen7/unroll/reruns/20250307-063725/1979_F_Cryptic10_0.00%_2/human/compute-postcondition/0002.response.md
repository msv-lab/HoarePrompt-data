Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `remaining_vertices`. The loop will execute as long as `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `path` is an empty list.
   - `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\).

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - The loop will execute the first time if `remaining_vertices` is not empty.
   - Since `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\), it is guaranteed to be non-empty as long as \(n\) is at least 1 (which is true given the constraint \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\)).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the constraints and the initial state, `remaining_vertices` will always contain integers from 1 to \(n\) and thus will never be empty. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\); `path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to \(n\)**
