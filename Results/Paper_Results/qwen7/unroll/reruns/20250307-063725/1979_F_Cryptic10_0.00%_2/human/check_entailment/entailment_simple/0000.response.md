### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a complete undirected graph with \( n \) vertices from which exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed.
   - We can query the graph to get information about the degrees of vertices and the presence of edges.
   - The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path using at most \( n \) queries.

2. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to query the graph for the number of vertices with a degree at least `d` and the minimum vertex not connected to that vertex.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to iteratively build a Hamiltonian path by removing vertices one by one.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - **Query Handling:** `func_1` correctly prints the query and reads the response.
   - **Path Construction:** `func_2` correctly builds the path by querying the graph and removing vertices.
   - **Termination Condition:** The loop in `func_2` ensures that we remove vertices until the graph is empty, constructing a Hamiltonian path.

4. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - The code correctly handles the queries and updates the state of the graph.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by removing vertices one by one, ensuring that each vertex is visited exactly once.
   - The code adheres to the constraint of making at most \( n \) queries.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where a vertex has a degree less than `d` by continuing to the next value of `d`.
   - It correctly identifies the vertex with the minimum degree and the minimum number when there are ties.

### Conclusion:
The given code appears to follow the problem description and the interaction protocol correctly. It constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the graph and removing vertices, ensuring that each vertex is visited exactly once.

### Correctness:
**True**
