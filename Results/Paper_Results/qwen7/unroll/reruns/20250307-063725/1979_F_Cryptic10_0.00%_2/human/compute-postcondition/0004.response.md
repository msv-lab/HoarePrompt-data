Based on the initial state provided:

- `path` is a list containing some vertices from 1 to n.
- `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.

The `print` statement is:

```python
print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
```

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `path` is a list of vertices from 1 to n.
2. `map(str, path)` converts each element in the `path` list to a string.
3. `' '.join(...)` joins these string elements with a space in between.
4. The formatted string is then printed, prefixed with `!`.

Given that `path` contains some vertices from 1 to n, and assuming the exact content of `path` is not specified, the output will be a string that starts with `!` followed by the vertices in `path` separated by spaces.

Output: **! [vertex1] [vertex2] ... [vertexN]** (where [vertex1], [vertex2], ..., [vertexN] are the vertices in the `path` list)
