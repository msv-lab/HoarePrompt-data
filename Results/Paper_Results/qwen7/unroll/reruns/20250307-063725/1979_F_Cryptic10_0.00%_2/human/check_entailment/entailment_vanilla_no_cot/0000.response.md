To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and waits for the response.
   - It returns the values of `v` and `u` as a tuple.
   - This part seems correct and follows the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It enters a loop until all vertices are added to the path.
   - Inside the loop, it tries to find a suitable vertex `v` by querying for degrees from `n-1` down to 0.
   - If `v` is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes it from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Finally, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

### Analysis:
- **Finding the Minimum Degree Vertex**:
  - The function correctly attempts to find the vertex with the minimum degree by querying from `n-1` down to 0.
  - If `v` is found and is still in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to the path. This ensures that we are always adding a new vertex to the path.
  
- **Removing Vertices**:
  - When a vertex `v` is added to the path, it is removed from `remaining_vertices`. This ensures that the same vertex is not queried again.
  
- **Handling the Case When No Suitable Vertex is Found**:
  - If no suitable vertex is found (i.e., `v` is 0), the loop continues to the next iteration, ensuring that the search for a suitable vertex continues.

### Potential Issues:
- The function assumes that a Hamiltonian path always exists, which is stated in the problem. However, the implementation should handle all edge cases properly.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where the graph might be disconnected or the queries might fail (though the problem guarantees the existence of a Hamiltonian path).

### Conclusion:
Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function appears to correctly find a Hamiltonian path within the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: True**
