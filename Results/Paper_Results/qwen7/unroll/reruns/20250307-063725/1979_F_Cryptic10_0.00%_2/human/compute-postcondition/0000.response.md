Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `path` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `path`. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `n` still holds its initial condition of being an integer between 2 and \(10^5\), inclusive, and `path` is now an empty list.
