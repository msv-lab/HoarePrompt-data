Output State: **The `path` list contains some vertices from 1 to n, and `remaining_vertices` is an empty set.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as there are vertices in `remaining_vertices`. For each iteration of the outer `while` loop, the inner `for` loop runs from `n-1` down to `0`. If `func_1(d)` returns a non-zero value for `v`, and `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it gets added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`. This process repeats until `remaining_vertices` is empty. Therefore, once the loop finishes, `remaining_vertices` will be empty, and `path` will contain some or all of the vertices from 1 to n, depending on the logic inside `func_1(d)`.
