Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, the logic used to calculate the area is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Sorting the Coordinates**: The program sorts the coordinates, but sorting alone does not help in identifying the side length of the square. Sorting might not place the coordinates in a way that makes it easy to identify the side lengths directly.

2. **Distance Calculation**: The program calculates the squared distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`). This approach assumes that these points are adjacent vertices of the square, which is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to identify the side length by comparing the distances between all pairs of points.

3. **Area Calculation**: The program multiplies the square roots of these distances to get the area, which is incorrect. The correct method would involve finding the actual side length of the square and then squaring it to get the area.

Given the problem constraints and the need to correctly identify the side length of the square, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
