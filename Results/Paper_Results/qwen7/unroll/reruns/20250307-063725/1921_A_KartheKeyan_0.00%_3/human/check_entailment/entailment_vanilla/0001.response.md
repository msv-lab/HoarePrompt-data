### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the coordinates of the four corners.

3. **Coordinate Sorting**:
   - The program sorts the coordinates, which is unnecessary for determining the side length of the square but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

4. **Calculating Side Length**:
   - The program calculates the squared distances between pairs of adjacent points to determine the side length.
   - Specifically, it calculates the distance between the first and second point (`p1`) and the third and fourth point (`p2`).
   - This approach assumes that the points are sorted in such a way that the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, are adjacent vertices of the square.

5. **Area Calculation**:
   - The side length is calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.
   - The area is then computed as the product of the side lengths.
   - However, this approach might be incorrect because the distances calculated might not necessarily represent the side length of the square. The correct method should involve finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among all points.

6. **Potential Issue**:
   - The current implementation assumes that the distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points are the side lengths of the square, which is not always true. For example, if the points are not sorted in a way that reflects the adjacency of the square's vertices, the distances might not be correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly identify the side length of the square. Therefore, the solution is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
