Functionality: **The function reads input from standard input, where each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i, representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. The function processes t testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each testcase, it checks if the provided coordinates form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. If the conditions are met, it returns a confirmation; otherwise, it indicates failure.**
