The function takes no input parameters directly, but the input is read from standard input. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i, representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. There are t testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each testcase, the coordinates provided form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.
