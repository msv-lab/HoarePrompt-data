Functionality: The function reads a series of testcases from standard input, where each testcase consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It processes each testcase, calculates the area of the square formed by these coordinates, and prints the absolute value of the square root of the product of the squared distances between specific points. This process repeats for `n` testcases, where `n` is the initial input integer. The function outputs a series of results, each corresponding to the computed area for each testcase.
