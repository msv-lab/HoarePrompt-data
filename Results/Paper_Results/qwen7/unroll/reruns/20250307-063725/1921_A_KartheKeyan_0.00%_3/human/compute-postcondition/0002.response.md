Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Identify the Variables in the Loop Head
The loop condition is `n`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero.

### Step 2: Determine the Current State of `n`
The current state is given as `n` is an input integer.

### Step 3: Determine the Condition for the First Iteration
For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero. Since the problem does not specify any specific value for `n` other than it being an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is non-zero.

### Step 4: Adjust the State
The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we need to adjust `n` to be non-zero.

### Final Answer
State: **`n` must be non-zero**
