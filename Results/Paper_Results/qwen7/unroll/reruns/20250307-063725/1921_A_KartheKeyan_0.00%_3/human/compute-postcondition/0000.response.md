Output State: **`n` is decreased by 1 after each iteration of the while loop, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each value of `l`, and the result is printed.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` which presumably represents the side length of a square. It then calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` and prints the value of `s`. After processing each test case, `n` is decremented by 1. The output state reflects these changes, with `n` being reduced by 1 for each test case processed and `s` being calculated and printed for each `l`.
