Output State: The output state will consist of a series of printed results, each representing the computed value of `res` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the code processes four pairs of coordinates (input by the user), sorts them, calculates the squared distances between specific points, computes the product of the square roots of these distances, and then prints the absolute value of this product. This process repeats `n` times, with `n` being the initial input integer. Each printed result corresponds to the value of `res` for that particular iteration.
