Output State: The output state will be a series of results printed after each iteration of the loop, each representing the calculated distance product for a set of four coordinate pairs provided as input.

Each iteration of the loop processes four coordinate pairs (x, y) entered by the user. These coordinates are sorted, and then the Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points are calculated. The product of the square roots of these distances is computed and printed. This process repeats until `n` becomes zero.

The output state will consist of `n` such results, one for each iteration of the loop, with each result being the product of the distances as described.
