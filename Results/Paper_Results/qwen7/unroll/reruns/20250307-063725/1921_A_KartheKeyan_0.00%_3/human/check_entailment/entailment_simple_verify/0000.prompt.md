You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no input parameters directly, but the input is read from standard input. Each testcase consists of four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i, representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. There are t testcases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each testcase, the coordinates provided form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of printed results, each representing the computed value of `res` for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the code processes four pairs of coordinates (input by the user), sorts them, calculates the squared distances between specific points, computes the product of the square roots of these distances, and then prints the absolute value of this product. This process repeats `n` times, with `n` being the initial input integer. Each printed result corresponds to the value of `res` for that particular iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine the sides of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between two points and assumes this distance is the side length of the square, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct area of the square with these coordinates is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the area using the distance formula, leading to an incorrect result. The program should instead identify the maximum difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the side length of the square.
