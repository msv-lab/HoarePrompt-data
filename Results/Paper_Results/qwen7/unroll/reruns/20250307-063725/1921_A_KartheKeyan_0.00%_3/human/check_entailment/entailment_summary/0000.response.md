Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates, sorts them, and calculates the distance between specific points to determine the side length of the square. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case.
2. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are stored in a list `coord` and sorted. This step is necessary to ensure that the points are processed in a consistent manner.
3. **Calculating Distances**: The program calculates the squared distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points. These distances should represent the diagonals of the square since the sides are parallel to the coordinate axes.
4. **Determining Side Length**: The side length of the square is derived from the square root of these distances. Since the diagonals of a square are equal and related to the side length by the formula \(d = s\sqrt{2}\), the side length \(s\) can be found using \(s = \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}}\).
5. **Calculating Area**: The area of the square is then computed as \(s^2\).

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the program logic appears to be correct. It handles the sorting and distance calculations appropriately to determine the side length and subsequently the area of the square.

Correctness: **True**
