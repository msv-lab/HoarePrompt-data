Functionality: The function reads a series of testcases from standard input, where each testcase consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It processes each testcase to calculate the area of the square formed by these coordinates. Specifically, it sorts the coordinates, computes the squared distances between specific points, finds the product of the square roots of these distances, and prints the absolute value of this product for each testcase. After processing all testcases, the function concludes with a series of printed outputs, each representing the calculated area of the square for that testcase.
