You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
Functionality: The function reads a series of testcases from standard input, where each testcase consists of four pairs of coordinates representing the corners of a square. It processes each testcase to calculate the area of the square formed by these coordinates. Specifically, it sorts the coordinates, computes the squared distances between specific points, finds the product of the square roots of these distances, and prints the absolute value of this product for each testcase. After processing all testcases, the function concludes with a series of printed outputs, each representing the calculated area of the square for that testcase.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine the sides of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between two points and assumes this distance is the side length of the square, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct area of the square with these coordinates is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the area using the distance formula, leading to an incorrect result. The program should instead identify the maximum difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the side length of the square.
