Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic used to determine the sides of the square is flawed. Specifically, the program calculates the distance between two points and assumes this distance is the side length of the square, which is incorrect. 

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
-1 1
1 -1
1 1
-1 -1
```

The correct area of the square with these coordinates is 4, but the program will incorrectly calculate the area using the distance formula, leading to an incorrect result. The program should instead identify the maximum difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates to determine the side length of the square.
