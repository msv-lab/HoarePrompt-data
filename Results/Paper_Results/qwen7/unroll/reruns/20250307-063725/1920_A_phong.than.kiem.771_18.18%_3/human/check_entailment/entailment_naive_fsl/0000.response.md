Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` to represent the initial bounds for `k`.
2. It iterates through each constraint:
   - For constraints of type 1 (`t == 1`), it updates `start` to the maximum of its current value and `v`.
   - For constraints of type 2 (`t == 2`), it updates `end` to the minimum of its current value and `v`.
   - For constraints of type 3 (`t == 3`), it adds `v` to the list `num` to keep track of values that `k` must not be equal to.
3. After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid values from the total range `[start, end]`.

Given the constraints and the guarantees provided in the problem statement, the program handles all cases correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to fail under the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
