### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints are of three types:
   - \( k \geq x \)
   - \( k \leq x \)
   - \( k \neq x \)

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1` to `func_7`) but does not use them in the main logic.
   - The main function `func_7` processes the input and calculates the number of valid \( k \) values.

3. **Main Function Logic**:
   - `n = int(input())`: Reads the number of constraints.
   - `start = -1` and `end = 1000000000.0`: Initialize the range boundaries.
   - Loop through each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k \geq x`), update `start` to the maximum of `start` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k \leq x`), update `end` to the minimum of `end` and `x`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k \neq x`), add `x` to the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints:
     - Count how many numbers in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
     - Adjust the count if the range `[start, end]` is invalid (i.e., `start > end`).
     - Calculate the total number of valid \( k \) values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the range `[start, end]` where \( k \) must lie.
   - It correctly handles the exclusion of specific values (`num`) from this range.
   - The final calculation ensures that only valid \( k \) values within the range are counted.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

**Correctness: True**
