### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints are of three types:
   - \( k \geq x \)
   - \( k \leq x \)
   - \( k \neq x \)

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`), but these functions do not seem to be used in the main logic of the program. This suggests that the main logic is implemented in `func_7`.
   - In `func_7`, the program reads the number of constraints \( n \).
   - It initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1000000000.0.
   - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - If \( t = 1 \) (i.e., \( k \geq x \)), it sets `start` to the maximum of `start` and \( x \).
     - If \( t = 2 \) (i.e., \( k \leq x \)), it sets `end` to the minimum of `end` and \( x \).
     - If \( t = 3 \) (i.e., \( k \neq x \)), it adds \( x \) to a list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it counts how many elements in `num` fall within the range \([start, end]\).
   - Finally, it calculates the number of valid integers \( k \) by subtracting the count of invalid elements from the total range \([start, end]\).

3. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the range \([start, end]\) is properly adjusted.
   - The handling of non-equality constraints is correct by checking if they fall outside the range \([start, end]\).
   - The final calculation of the number of valid integers is accurate.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where `start` exceeds `end`, returning 0.
   - The solution correctly handles overlapping constraints and ensures the range is finite.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
