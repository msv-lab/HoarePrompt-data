Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_7` does not handle the constraints properly. Here's why:

1. **Initialization of `start` and `end`:**
   - The initial values for `start` and `end` are set to `-1` and `1000000000.0`, respectively. This is incorrect because `start` should be initialized to the maximum possible value that could be constrained by any `t=1` constraint, and `end` should be initialized to the minimum possible value that could be constrained by any `t=2` constraint.

2. **Handling Constraints:**
   - For `t=1`, the code correctly updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
   - For `t=2`, the code correctly updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
   - However, for `t=3`, the code appends the value `v` to the `num` list without considering whether this value already constrains `start` or `end`.

3. **Counting Valid `k`:**
   - The logic to count valid `k` values after processing all constraints is flawed. It checks if each `i` in `num` is within the range `[start, end]` but does not correctly account for the overlap between different constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_7`:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = float('-inf')
    num = set()

    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            num.add(v)

    # Calculate the number of valid k values
    if start > end:
        return 0
    valid_k_count = end - start + 1
    for v in num:
        if start <= v <= end:
            valid_k_count -= 1
    return valid_k_count
```

This corrected function initializes `start` and `end` correctly, processes the constraints accurately, and counts the valid `k` values correctly.
