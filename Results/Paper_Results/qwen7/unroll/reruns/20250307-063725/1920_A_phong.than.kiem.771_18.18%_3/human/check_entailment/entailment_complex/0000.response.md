Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly handles the input for the number of constraints. It returns an integer `n` which is the number of constraints for each test case.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is used to read the constraints for each test case. It correctly parses the input and returns a list of tuples representing the constraints.
3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is not used in the given program, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the program.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the given program, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the program.
5. **Function `func_5`**: This function is not used in the given program, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the program.
6. **Function `func_6`**: This function is not used in the given program, so it doesn't affect the correctness of the program.
7. **Function `func_7`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It identifies the range `[start, end]` from constraints of type 1 and 2, and then checks how many values from constraints of type 3 fall outside this range. The logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given that all functions work as intended and the main logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
