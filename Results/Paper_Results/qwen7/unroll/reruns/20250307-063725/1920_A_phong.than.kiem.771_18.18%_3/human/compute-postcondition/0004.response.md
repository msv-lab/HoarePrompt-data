Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the loop head, but it will start from 0 (the default starting value for `range(n)`).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).

3. **Check if the loop can execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. Since \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) ensures that `n` is always greater than or equal to 1, this condition is inherently satisfied.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - We need to ensure that `n` is within the specified range and that `i` starts from 0.

Given the above steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` should be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `i` should be 0 (the default starting value for `range(n)`).

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`start` is -1, `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
