Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being assigned values from the list `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the list `num`, the initial value of `i` will be the first element of `num`.

3. **Determine the State of `num`**: For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `num`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `start`: This is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1. The value of `start` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute.
   - `end`: This is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2. The value of `end` does not directly affect whether the loop can execute.
   - `num`: This list must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - `count_num`: This variable is not used in the loop condition and does not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num` to ensure it contains at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` must contain at least one element**
