#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return an integer input or the integer 1. If isOne is False, then the function expects an integer input representing the number of constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). If isOne is True, the function returns the integer 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer input if isOne is False, otherwise, it does not expect an integer input and returns nothing.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it returns an integer input provided by the user, which must be within the range of 2 to 100. If `isOne` is `True`, it returns the integer 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each line within a test case contains two integers separated by space, where the first integer (a) represents the type of constraint, and the second integer (x) represents the value associated with the constraint.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `line` is the next input string which is a line of input from the user, and `items` is a list of strings. If `line` contains spaces, `items` is obtained by splitting `line` at spaces. If `line` does not contain any spaces, `items` is a list containing each character of the string `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #A list of integers obtained by converting each item in the list 'items' to an integer.
    else :
        return items
        #`items` is a list containing each character of the string `line` if `line` does not contain any spaces, otherwise it remains as a list of strings as originally defined.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space`, which is a string, and `to_int`, which is a boolean. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is true, it splits the line based on spaces; otherwise, it treats the entire line as a single string and splits it into individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts each item in the resulting list to an integer and returns the list of integers. If `to_int` is false, it returns the list of items as strings or characters, depending on whether the line contained spaces or not.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string representing the separator between the integers.
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: Output State: `string` is a concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by the string `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is a concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by the string `sym`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates all integers in `arr` into a single string, using `sym` as a separator between each integer. The function then returns this resulting concatenated string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_4` does not seem to relate to the problem description given. The function `func_4` searches for all occurrences of a substring within a string and returns their indices. This function does not contribute to solving the problem described in the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the function signature, I will extract the precondition based on the variables in the function signature. However, since the function signature does not match the problem, I will provide the precondition based on the problem description instead.

### Problem Description
Alex is solving a problem where he has \( n \) constraints on what the integer \( k \) can be. There are three types of constraints:
1. \( k \) must be greater than or equal to some integer \( x \).
2. \( k \) must be less than or equal to some integer \( x \).
3. \( k \) must be not equal to some integer \( x \).

We need to find the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all \( n \) constraints.

### Precondition
**t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in \{1, 2, 3\} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Constraints of type 1 and type 2 are guaranteed to exist, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.**
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `indices` is a list containing a series of integers, and `index` is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns the list 'indices' which contains a series of integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. It searches for all occurrences of `substring` within `string` and returns a list of integers representing the starting indices of these occurrences. If no occurrences are found, it returns an empty list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer that exists within the list arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the integer 'element' exists within the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element`. It returns a list of indices where `element` is found within `arr`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly three integers (a, x, index), representing a constraint on k. index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(subArray), and value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly three integers (a, x, index). The loop iterates through each subArray in arr. If subArray[index] equals value, it returns the subArray. If no subArray satisfies the condition, the function returns None.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, an integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find a sublist where the element at the specified `index` matches the given `value`. If such a sublist is found, it returns that sublist; otherwise, it returns `None`. After executing the function, the program state is such that it either returns a matching sublist or `None`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (t, x) are distinct.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):

        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v

                end = v

            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:

    #State: Output State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are outside the range `[start, end]`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if this difference is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of constraints involving integers and calculates a specific value based on these constraints. It first identifies the minimum value (`start`) from constraints of type 1 and the maximum value (`end`) from constraints of type 2. It then collects all values from constraints of type 3 into a list (`num`). Afterward, it counts how many elements in `num` fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`. If the range defined by `start` and `end` is invalid (i.e., `start` is greater than `end`), the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of elements within the range, but only if this difference is greater than or equal to the count; otherwise, it returns 0.
