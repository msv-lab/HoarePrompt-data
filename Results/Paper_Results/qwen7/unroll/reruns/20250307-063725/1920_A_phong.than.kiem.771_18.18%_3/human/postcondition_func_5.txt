The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, an integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find a sublist where the element at the specified `index` matches the given `value`. If such a sublist is found, it returns that sublist; otherwise, it returns `None`. After executing the function, the program state is such that it either returns a matching sublist or `None`.
