The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space`, which is a string, and `to_int`, which is a boolean. It reads a line of input from the user. If `space` is true, it splits the line based on spaces; otherwise, it treats the entire line as a single string and splits it into individual characters. If `to_int` is true, it converts each item in the resulting list to an integer and returns the list of integers. If `to_int` is false, it returns the list of items as strings or characters, depending on whether the line contained spaces or not.
