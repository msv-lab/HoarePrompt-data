Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return an integer input or the integer 1. If isOne is False, then the function expects an integer input representing the number of constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100). If isOne is True, the function returns the integer 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer input if isOne is False, otherwise, it does not expect an integer input and returns nothing.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_4` does not seem to relate to the problem description given. The function `func_4` searches for all occurrences of a substring within a string and returns their indices. This function does not contribute to solving the problem described in the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the function signature, I will extract the precondition based on the variables in the function signature. However, since the function signature does not match the problem, I will provide the precondition based on the problem description instead.

### Problem Description
Alex is solving a problem where he has \( n \) constraints on what the integer \( k \) can be. There are three types of constraints:
1. \( k \) must be greater than or equal to some integer \( x \).
2. \( k \) must be less than or equal to some integer \( x \).
3. \( k \) must be not equal to some integer \( x \).

We need to find the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all \( n \) constraints.

### Precondition
**t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, representing the number of constraints. Each constraint is represented by a pair (a, x) where a is an integer in \{1, 2, 3\} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Constraints of type 1 and type 2 are guaranteed to exist, and all pairs (a, x) are distinct.**
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: The variable `t` remains unchanged, `indices` is a list containing a series of integers, and `index` is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns the list 'indices' which contains a series of integers.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer that exists within the list arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the integer 'element' exists within the list 'arr'

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly three integers (a, x, index), representing a constraint on k. index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(subArray), and value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: arr is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly three integers (a, x, index). The loop iterates through each subArray in arr. If subArray[index] equals value, it returns the subArray. If no subArray satisfies the condition, the function returns None.
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all pairs (t, x) are distinct.

                end = v

            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3.

    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are outside the range `[start, end]`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if this difference is greater than or equal to `count_num`; otherwise, it returns 0.
