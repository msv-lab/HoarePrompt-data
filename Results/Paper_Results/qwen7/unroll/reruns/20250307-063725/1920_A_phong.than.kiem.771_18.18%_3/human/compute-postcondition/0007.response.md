Output State: **`start` is the minimum value among all `v` where `t` equals 1, `end` is the maximum value among all `v` where `t` equals 2, `num` is a list containing all `v` where `t` equals 3, `count_num` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `count_num` to 0. This does not affect the values of `start`, `end`, or `num`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `count_num` to 0.
