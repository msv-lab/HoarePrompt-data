### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. There are three types of constraints:
   - \( k \geq x \) (type 1)
   - \( k \leq x \) (type 2)
   - \( k \neq x \) (type 3)

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(isOne=False)**: Returns the number of constraints \( n \).
   - **func_2(space=True, to_int=True)**: Reads and splits input into integers or characters.
   - **func_3(arr, sym)**: Concatenates integers with a separator.
   - **func_4(string, substring)**: Finds all occurrences of a substring within a string.
   - **func_5(arr, element)**: Finds all indices where an element appears in a list.
   - **func_6(arr, index, value)**: Searches for a sublist where a specific element matches.
   - **func_7()**: Processes the constraints and calculates the valid range of \( k \).

3. **Key Function: func_7()**:
   - Initializes `start` and `end` to handle constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - Collects all values from constraints of type 3 into a list `num`.
   - Checks if any value in `num` falls outside the range `[start, end]`.
   - Ensures the range `[start, end]` is valid before calculating the number of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Execution Summary of func_7()**:
   - Correctly identifies the minimum and maximum bounds from constraints of type 1 and 2.
   - Properly handles constraints of type 3 by excluding them from the valid range.
   - Ensures the range is valid before returning the count of valid \( k \) values.

5. **Program Flow**:
   - The main program correctly iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_7()` to get the number of valid \( k \) values.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. All functions work together to process the constraints and calculate the valid range of \( k \). Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
