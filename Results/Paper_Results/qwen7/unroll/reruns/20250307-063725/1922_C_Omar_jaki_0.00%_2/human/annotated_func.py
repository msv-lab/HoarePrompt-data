    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed values resulting from the operations within the loop, each line containing a pair of numbers separated by a space, followed by 'B'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs until `t` becomes 0. During each iteration, it performs several operations on the list `a` and prints the result of certain calculations based on the values generated by the lambda function `r()`. The exact output depends on the specific values returned by `r()` during each iteration, but generally, it will consist of pairs of numbers derived from the cumulative sums of differences between elements in `a`, adjusted based on conditions involving those differences.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t, then iterates t times. During each iteration, it reads additional data including a list a of n integers, and processes this list to compute certain cumulative sums based on differences between consecutive elements. It then reads m queries and for each query, calculates and prints a difference value based on the computed sums. The final output consists of multiple lines, each containing a pair of numbers followed by 'B', representing the calculated differences for each query.
