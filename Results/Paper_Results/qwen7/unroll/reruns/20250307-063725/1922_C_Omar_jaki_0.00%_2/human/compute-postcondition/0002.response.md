Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state of `t`**: According to the given state, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
3. **Understand the loop execution requirement**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

Given that `t` is initially an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), it is already guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t`.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `t` and it is already in a state where the loop can execute, no additional adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5**
