Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities. Specifically, the program uses a lambda function and a complex calculation involving `b` which seems to be intended to store cumulative distances but is not implemented correctly according to the problem description.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(5, 1)`.

The program should output:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the given program does not produce these results. For instance, for the query `(1, 4)`, the program incorrectly calculates the distance as if it were using a different logic, leading to an incorrect result of `3` instead of the correct value based on the closest city rule.

A correct implementation would involve identifying the closest city for each query and calculating the minimum cost based on the rules provided. The given program does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
