Output State: The output state will be a series of printed values resulting from the operations within the loop, each line containing a pair of numbers separated by a space, followed by 'B'.

Explanation: The loop runs until `t` becomes 0. During each iteration, it performs several operations on the list `a` and prints the result of certain calculations based on the values generated by the lambda function `r()`. The exact output depends on the specific values returned by `r()` during each iteration, but generally, it will consist of pairs of numbers derived from the cumulative sums of differences between elements in `a`, adjusted based on conditions involving those differences.
