You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed values resulting from the operations within the loop, each line containing a pair of numbers separated by a space, followed by 'B'.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs until `t` becomes 0. During each iteration, it performs several operations on the list `a` and prints the result of certain calculations based on the values generated by the lambda function `r()`. The exact output depends on the specific values returned by `r()` during each iteration, but generally, it will consist of pairs of numbers derived from the cumulative sums of differences between elements in `a`, adjusted based on conditions involving those differences.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`, but only processes one test case in the loop. This is incorrect because the function should handle all test cases as specified.
   
2. **Array Construction**:
   - The array `a` is constructed with additional boundary values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`. These values are used to simplify the logic for finding the closest city, but they are not necessary and might cause issues. Instead, we can directly use the list of city coordinates.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The distances between consecutive cities are calculated using `v = y - x`. However, the logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between cities seems overly complex and incorrect. Specifically, the use of `b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))` is not clear and does not seem to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum cost.

4. **Query Processing**:
   - The program attempts to process queries using the precomputed values in `b`, but the logic for computing these values is flawed. The values in `b` are not correctly representing the cumulative minimum costs for reaching each city.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is computed using `print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])` and similar expressions, which again suggests an incorrect approach to solving the problem.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It appears to have some misunderstandings about how to compute the minimum cost for traveling between cities and does not accurately represent the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for calculating the minimum cost and handling the test cases.
