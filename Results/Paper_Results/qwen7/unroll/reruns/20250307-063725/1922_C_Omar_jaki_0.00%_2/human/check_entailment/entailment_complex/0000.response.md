Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the calculation of the closest city and the subsequent minimum cost calculation are not implemented properly.
2. The variable `b` is being updated with cumulative sums of differences, but these differences do not directly represent the minimum cost to travel to the closest city.
3. The logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities is flawed. The current implementation does not account for the unique property that each city has a unique closest city.
4. The code does not handle the actual queries correctly. It seems to be trying to calculate some kind of cumulative sum, but this is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
