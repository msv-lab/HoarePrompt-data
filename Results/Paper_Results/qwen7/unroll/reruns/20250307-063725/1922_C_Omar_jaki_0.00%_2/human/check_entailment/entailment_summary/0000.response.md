Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by processing each test case and calculating the required cumulative sums.
2. The program reads the input correctly and processes it to compute the necessary values for each query.
3. The logic for computing the cumulative sums seems to be based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`, which is intended to represent the distances between closest cities.
4. However, there are several issues with the implementation:
   - The lambda function `r` is defined but not used in the main logic of the program.
   - The list `a` is constructed with additional boundary values (`-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`), which are not necessary and could lead to confusion.
   - The computation of `b` involves complex operations that do not directly relate to the problem requirements.
   - The final part of the program where it processes queries and prints results seems to be based on the incorrect computation of `b`.
5. The execution summary indicates that the program computes some cumulative sums and uses these sums to answer queries, but the actual logic for these computations does not align with the problem description.

Given these observations, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
