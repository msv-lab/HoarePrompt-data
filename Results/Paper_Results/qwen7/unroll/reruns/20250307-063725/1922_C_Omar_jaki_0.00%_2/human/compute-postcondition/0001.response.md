Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, `t` is assigned the value of the first element returned by the lambda function `r()`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is updated to be the first element returned by the lambda function `r()`, which splits the input and maps each element to an integer. All other variables remain unchanged with their initial conditions.
