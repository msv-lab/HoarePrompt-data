Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads input, splits it into multiple integers, and maps each integer to an integer type. However, no actual input is read or processed in this snippet, so the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `m` remain unchanged. The lambda function `r` is now available for use in subsequent code.
