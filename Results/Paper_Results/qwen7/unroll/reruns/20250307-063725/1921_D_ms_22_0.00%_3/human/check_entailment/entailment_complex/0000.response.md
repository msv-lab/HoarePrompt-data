Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases (`t`). It then iterates through each test case, reading the values of `n`, `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The program sorts the array `b` and initializes a max heap to keep track of the largest differences. This is a good approach to maximize the total difference.

3. **Heap Operations**: For each element in `a`, the program calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`. It pushes the larger of these differences into the max heap. This ensures that the largest possible differences are considered first.

4. **Adjusting Pointers**: The program uses two pointers (`tp1` and `tp2`) to adjust the indices of `b` when the current index in the heap no longer corresponds to the closest elements. This adjustment helps in maintaining the closest elements dynamically as the heap is processed.

5. **Accumulating Differences**: The program accumulates the differences from the heap, ensuring that the largest possible differences are used first. This maximizes the total difference `D`.

6. **Output**: The program prints the accumulated difference for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the strategy to maximize the total difference `D`. The use of a max heap and dynamic adjustment of pointers ensure that the largest possible differences are always considered first.

Correctness: **True**
