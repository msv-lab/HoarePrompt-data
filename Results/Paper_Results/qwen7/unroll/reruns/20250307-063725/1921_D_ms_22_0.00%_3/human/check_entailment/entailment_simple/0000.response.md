Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The program sorts the array `b` and initializes a max heap to keep track of the largest differences. This is a good approach to maximize the total difference.

3. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a heap to efficiently get the largest differences between elements of `a` and `b`. It correctly pushes the differences into the heap and pops the largest ones to update the indices `tp1` and `tp2`.

4. **Index Management**: The program manages the indices `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure they stay within bounds and correctly updates the answer `ans` by adding the appropriate differences.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum total difference `D`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic seems sound and should work as intended to maximize the total difference `D`.

Correctness: **True**
