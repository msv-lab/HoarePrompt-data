### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\).
   - To achieve this, we should pair each element \(a_i\) with either the smallest or the largest available \(b_j\) to maximize the absolute difference.
   - The program uses a min-heap to keep track of the differences between elements of \(a\) and the smallest and largest elements of \(b\).

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\), followed by arrays \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It sorts the array \(b\) to facilitate finding the smallest and largest elements efficiently.
   - A max-heap (`max_heap`) is used to store the differences along with the indices of the elements in \(b\) that were considered.
   - The logic inside the loop iterates through each element in \(a\), calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in \(b\), and pushes these differences into the heap.
   - The main loop pops elements from the heap and adjusts the indices of the elements in \(b\) to ensure they are within the current range `[tp1, tp2]`.
   - If the indices are out of range, it recalculates the differences using the closest available elements in the range.
   - Finally, it sums up the differences and prints the result.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases where the indices might go out of bounds by adjusting `tp1` and `tp2`.
   - The sorting and heap operations ensure that the differences are calculated efficiently.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The approach of using a max-heap to keep track of the maximum differences is sound.
   - The logic for adjusting indices and recalculating differences when necessary is correct.
   - The overall structure of the code matches the problem requirements.

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:**
   - **Initial State:** `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\). Arrays `a` and `b` contain integers such that \(1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9\).
   - **Sorting `b`:** The array `b` is sorted to facilitate efficient access to the smallest and largest elements.
   - **Max-Heap Initialization:** A max-heap is initialized to store tuples of differences and their corresponding indices in `b`.
   - **Main Loop:** For each element in `a`, the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b` are calculated and pushed into the heap.
   - **Heap Processing:** Elements are popped from the heap and adjusted indices are used to ensure they are within the current range `[tp1, tp2]`. If indices are out of range, the differences are recalculated using the closest available elements.
   - **Summing Differences:** The differences are summed up and printed.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\).
   - The use of a max-heap ensures that the maximum differences are always considered.
   - The handling of indices and boundary conditions is correct.
