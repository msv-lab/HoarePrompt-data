Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, t is a positive integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. a_i and b_i are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive for all i. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**
