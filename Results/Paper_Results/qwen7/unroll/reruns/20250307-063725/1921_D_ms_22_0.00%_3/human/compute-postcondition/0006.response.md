Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element in list a and the closest elements in list b. After processing all test cases, it prints the total sum of these minimum absolute differences.**
