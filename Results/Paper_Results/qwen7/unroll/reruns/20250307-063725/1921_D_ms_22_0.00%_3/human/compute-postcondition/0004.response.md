Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. If `t` is 0, the variable `ans` contains the sum of minimum absolute differences for each element in list `a` with the closest elements in list `b` as processed by the algorithm described in the loop. Otherwise, `t` remains unchanged and `ans` retains its previous value.**
