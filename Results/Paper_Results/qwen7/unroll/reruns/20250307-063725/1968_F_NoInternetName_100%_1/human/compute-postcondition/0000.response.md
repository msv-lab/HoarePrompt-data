Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, and the function `func_1` has been called to assign values to `n` and `q`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `n, q = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an argument of type `int`. The function returns two values, which are assigned to `n` and `q`. The initial conditions for `n` and `q` remain valid, and the values of `a`, `l`, and `r` are unchanged.
