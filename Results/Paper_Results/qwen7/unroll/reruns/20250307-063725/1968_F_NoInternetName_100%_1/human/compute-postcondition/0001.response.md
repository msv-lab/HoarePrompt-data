Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, and `a` is now a list of integers generated by `func_1(int)`**.

The code `a = list(func_1(int))` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `int`, which presumably returns a list of integers. This list replaces the existing list `a`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `l`, `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
