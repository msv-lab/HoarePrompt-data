You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Program:
from collections import defaultdict
#Function 1:
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    (l, r) = (0, len(arr))
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if predicate(arr[l]):
        return l
    return None

#Function 3:
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)

#Function 4:
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if result is not None:
        return result + 1
    return None

#Function 5:
def func_5():
    (n, q) = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
    for i in range(q):
        (l, r) = func_1(int)
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( q \), along with a list \( a \) of integers and multiple queries defined by pairs of positive integers \( l \) and \( r \). It constructs a list \( x \) where each element is the cumulative XOR of the previous element in \( x \) and the corresponding element in \( a \). For each query, it checks if there exists any valid pair \( (l, r) \) such that either \( x[l-1] == x[r] \) or the number of indices in the range \([lower, upper]\) where the condition holds true. If such a pair exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify the input list \( a \) or the dictionary \( inds \).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. This involves calculating the cumulative XOR up to each index and using binary search to find appropriate split points.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads space-separated integers from input and applies a specified cast.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the first element in the array that satisfies a given predicate.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is essentially a wrapper around `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function returns the index of the first element that satisfies the predicate plus one.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function processes the main logic of the problem.

3. **Main Logic in Function 5**:
   - Reads `n` and `q` from input.
   - Reads the array `a` and calculates the cumulative XOR values.
   - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs.
   - For each query, checks if the cumulative XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero (which would mean the subarray is already interesting).
   - Uses binary search to find the appropriate split points to check if the subarray can be divided into equal XOR parts.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code seems to correctly handle the logic for checking if a subarray is interesting.
   - The use of binary search and dictionaries appears to be appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - The overall structure and logic appear sound, but there is no explicit handling of edge cases or invalid inputs, which is generally good practice.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It handles the required operations efficiently and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms.
