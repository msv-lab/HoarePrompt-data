Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that all functions together correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function reads a space-separated string of integers and converts them to the appropriate type using the provided `cast` function. This is used to read the input values for `n`, `q`, and the array `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function performs a binary search to find the leftmost index where the predicate function returns `True`. This is used in `func_4` and `func_3`.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function simply calls `func_2` and returns its result. It is not directly used in the main logic but might be useful for some internal operations.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function increments the result of `func_2` by 1 if `func_2` returns a value. Otherwise, it returns `None`. This is used in the main logic to handle edge cases in binary search.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This is the main function that processes the input and handles the queries. It:
   - Reads `n` and `q` and the array `a`.
   - Constructs a list `x` where each element is the cumulative XOR of the previous element in `x` and the corresponding element in `a`.
   - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray is interesting by verifying if there exists a valid split such that the XOR of elements in each part is equal.

Given the detailed execution summaries, the logic in `func_5` seems to correctly implement the required functionality. It uses the cumulative XOR to efficiently check for interesting subarrays by leveraging the properties of XOR and the stored indices in `inds`.

Since the provided functions collectively implement the logic described in the problem statement accurately, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
