Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for checking if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program uses binary search to find indices in the dictionary `inds`, but it does not ensure that the subarray can be split into more than one segment with equal XOR values.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the array `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and the query `l = 1, r = 5`. The subarray is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`, and its XOR is `1 ^ 1 ^ 2 ^ 3 ^ 0 = 3`. However, the program incorrectly returns "Yes" because it checks if the XOR value matches at the boundaries without ensuring that the subarray can be split into more than one segment with equal XOR values.

A correct approach would involve checking if there are multiple segments with the same XOR value. The provided program does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
