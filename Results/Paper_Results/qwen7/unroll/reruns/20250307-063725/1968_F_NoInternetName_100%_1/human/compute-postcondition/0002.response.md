Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes `x` as a list containing a single element, which is `0`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, or `r`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
