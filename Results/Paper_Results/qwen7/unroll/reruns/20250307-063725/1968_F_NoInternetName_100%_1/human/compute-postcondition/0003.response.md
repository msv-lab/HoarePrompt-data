Output State: **`inds` is a dictionary where each key is a default list and no elements have been added to these lists yet; `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

The code initializes `inds` as a defaultdict of lists. This means that `inds` is now a dictionary where each key maps to a list, but no elements have been added to these lists yet. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
