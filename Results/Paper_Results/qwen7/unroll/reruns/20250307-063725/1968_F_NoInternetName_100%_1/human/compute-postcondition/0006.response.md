Output State: `inds` is a dictionary where each key is an integer generated by the expression `x[-1] ^ i` for each `i` in `a`, and the value for each key is a list of indices where that key appears in `x`. The list `x` contains integers generated by appending `x[-1] ^ i` to itself for each `i` in `a`. The variable `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `q` and `n` are also unchanged from their initial values.
