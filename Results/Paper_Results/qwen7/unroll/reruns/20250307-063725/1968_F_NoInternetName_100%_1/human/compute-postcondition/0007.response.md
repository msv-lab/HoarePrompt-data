Output State: `inds` is a dictionary where each key is an integer generated by the expression `x[-1] ^ i` for each iteration, and the value for each key is a list of indices where that key appears in the list `x`. The list `x` contains integers generated by XORing the previous element with each element in the list `a`. The variable `l`, `r`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state, with `x` containing a single element 0.
