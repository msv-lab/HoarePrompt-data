Output State: **`inds` is a dictionary where the key 0 has a list with one element [0], `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where 0 <= a_i < 2^30, `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n, `x` is a list containing the single element 0.**

In this output state, the dictionary `inds` now contains a key `0` with a list that has appended the value `0`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
