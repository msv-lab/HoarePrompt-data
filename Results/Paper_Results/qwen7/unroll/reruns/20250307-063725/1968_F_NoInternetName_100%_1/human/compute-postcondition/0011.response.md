Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( q \), along with a list \( a \) of integers and multiple queries defined by pairs of positive integers \( l \) and \( r \). It constructs a list \( x \) where each element is the cumulative XOR of the previous element in \( x \) and the corresponding element in \( a \). For each query, it checks if there exists any valid pair \( (l, r) \) such that either \( x[l-1] == x[r] \) or the number of indices in the range \([lower, upper]\) where the condition holds true. If such a pair exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not modify the input list \( a \) or the dictionary \( inds \).**
