### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to determine if a subarray is interesting, meaning it can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is the same.
   - The solution uses a prefix XOR array to efficiently check this condition.

2. **Key Components of the Solution:**
   - **Prefix XOR Array (`x`):** This array helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray.
   - **Query Handling:** The solution iterates through each query and checks if the subarray from index `l` to `r` is interesting.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function reads and maps input values, which is used to read integers and split them.
   - **Function `func_2` and `func_3`:** These functions perform binary search, but they are not directly used in the main logic of the program.
   - **Function `func_4` and `func_5`:** These functions handle the binary search results and are not used in the main logic either.
   - **Main Logic (`func_5`):**
     - **Reading Input:** It reads `n` and `q`, and the array `a`.
     - **Building Prefix XOR Array (`x`):** This array is built by taking the cumulative XOR of elements in `a`.
     - **Handling Queries:** For each query, it checks if the XOR of the entire subarray from `l` to `r` is zero (indicating the subarray is interesting).
     - **Binary Search Usage:** The binary search functions are not utilized in the current implementation, which is fine as they are not needed for the logic.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The code correctly builds the prefix XOR array and checks if the subarray is interesting by verifying if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
   - The logic for checking the subarray is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.
