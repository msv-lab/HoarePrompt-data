### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. This involves calculating the cumulative XOR up to each index and using binary search to find appropriate split points.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads space-separated integers from input and applies a specified cast.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function performs a binary search to find the first element in the array that satisfies a given predicate.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is essentially a wrapper around `func_2`.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function returns the index of the first element that satisfies the predicate plus one.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function processes the main logic of the problem.

3. **Main Logic in Function 5**:
   - Reads `n` and `q` from input.
   - Reads the array `a` and calculates the cumulative XOR values.
   - Uses a dictionary `inds` to store indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs.
   - For each query, checks if the cumulative XOR from `l-1` to `r` is zero (which would mean the subarray is already interesting).
   - Uses binary search to find the appropriate split points to check if the subarray can be divided into equal XOR parts.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - The code seems to correctly handle the logic for checking if a subarray is interesting.
   - The use of binary search and dictionaries appears to be appropriate for the problem constraints.
   - The overall structure and logic appear sound, but there is no explicit handling of edge cases or invalid inputs, which is generally good practice.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It handles the required operations efficiently and uses appropriate data structures and algorithms.
