Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly generates all possible subarray sums from a given list of subarray sums. It iterates through the list and accumulates sums, storing them in a new list `cts`. The function then sorts this list and returns it. This part is correct and necessary for generating the complete set of subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies and removes duplicates from the list of subarray sums. By checking if the current element is the same as the last element in the `odds` list, it ensures that only unique elements are kept. This is crucial for identifying the missing sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function constructs a palindrome array based on the unique subarray sums. It fills the middle (or middle elements if `n` is even) with the values from `odds` and mirrors these values symmetrically. This approach is sound for constructing a palindrome array.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the incomplete list (`smallList`). It removes matching elements from both lists until they differ, then returns the last element of `bigList`. This logic is correct for finding the missing sum.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly handles the case where the number of unique subarray sums is greater than `(n + 1) / 2` and uses `func_3` and `func_4` appropriately.
   - For the case where the number of unique subarray sums is less than or equal to `(n + 1) / 2`, it uses `func_3` and `func_4` to find the missing sum and construct the palindrome array.

Given that all functions are implemented correctly and the main logic properly handles the problem constraints, the program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
