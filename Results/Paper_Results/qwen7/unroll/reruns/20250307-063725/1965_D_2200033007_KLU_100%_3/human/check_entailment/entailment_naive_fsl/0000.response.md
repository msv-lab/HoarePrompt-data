Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums and sorts them. However, it does not handle the fact that the input list of subarray sums is missing exactly one sum. It simply generates all possible subarray sums and returns them sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to remove duplicate sums from the list. However, it does not account for the fact that the missing sum might not be a duplicate but rather a unique value that needs to be identified.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function tries to reconstruct the palindrome array from the list of unique subarray sums. However, it does not correctly handle the reconstruction process. Specifically, it does not ensure that the array remains a palindrome after reconstruction. For example, consider the following input:

   - Input: `n = 4`, subarray sums: `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
   - The missing sum is `4`.
   - The reconstructed array using the provided functions is `[7, 2, 2, 7]`, which is a palindrome.
   - However, another valid palindrome could be `[6, 4, 4, 6]`, which also fits the criteria but is not generated by the provided functions.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the provided solution and seems to be a placeholder or a helper function that is not relevant to the main logic.

Given these observations, the provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
