### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes all subarray sums and stores them in a list `cts`.
   - However, the order of these sums is not preserved in the context of the problem, as the goal is to find unique subarray sums, not all subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - The logic in `func_2` is flawed. It only checks the last element of `odds` and removes it if a duplicate is found. This approach will not correctly handle cases where multiple subarrays have the same sum but are not consecutive in the list of all subarray sums.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - The logic here is also flawed. It assumes that the middle element (or the two middle elements if `n` is even) can be directly derived from the first element of `odds`, and it fills the array symmetrically around the middle. However, this approach does not guarantee that the resulting array will be a valid palindrome based on the given subarray sums.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - As noted in the original assessment, this function is not used in the provided solution and seems redundant. Its purpose is unclear in the context of the problem.

Given the above points, the original assessment is inaccurate. The functions do not correctly implement the logic required to recover a valid palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Specifically, the methods for identifying unique subarray sums and reconstructing the palindrome array are flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
