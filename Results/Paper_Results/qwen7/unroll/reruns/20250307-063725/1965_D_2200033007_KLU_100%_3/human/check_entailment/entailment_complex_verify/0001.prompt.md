You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of a is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where \(n\) is the size of the unknown palindrome array a.

    #The program returns the sorted list `cts` containing all possible subarray sums of the list `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates all possible subarray sums starting from each index to any subsequent index in `a`, stores these sums in a list `cts`, sorts this list, and returns the sorted list `cts`.

#Function 2:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cts`, which represents all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. It removes any duplicate elements from this list and returns a new list `odds` containing only unique elements from the original list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array a, excluding one sum. n is an integer representing the size of the array a, and it is guaranteed that n is odd and 3 <= n <= 1000.

The first half of the list is mirrored in the second half, except for the middle element if `n` is odd. Since `odds` is an empty list, the list `a` will also be empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` as input. It constructs a list `a` of size `n` such that the middle element (or elements) are filled with the values from `odds`, and for each pair of symmetric indices, their values are equal. The first half of the list is mirrored in the second half, except for the middle element if `n` is odd. If `odds` is an empty list, the resulting list `a` will also be empty.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums of a palindrome array a, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a, with the last element of bigList being equal to the last element of smallList.

    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of bigList, which is different from the last element of smallList.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`. It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. After the loop ends, the function returns the last element of `bigList`, ensuring it is different from the last element of `smallList`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of all subarrays of the input list `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and accumulates the sum of subarrays starting from `i` to the end of the list.
   - The results are stored in `cts`, which is then sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of the sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (removing the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum `ct` to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reconstructs the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It sets the middle element (or the two middle elements if `n` is even) using the first element of `odds`.
   - For subsequent elements, it calculates the value needed to maintain the palindrome property by ensuring the sum of subarrays matches the given unique sums.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems redundant.
   - It attempts to remove the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` if they are equal, but it is not utilized in the main logic.

### Analysis:
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` collectively aim to identify the unique subarray sums and use them to reconstruct a valid palindrome array.
- Given the constraints and the nature of palindromes, the approach should work correctly for the provided problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to recover a possible palindrome array from the given subarray sums.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
