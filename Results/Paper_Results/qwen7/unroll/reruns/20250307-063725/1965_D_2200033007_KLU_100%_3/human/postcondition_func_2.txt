The function takes a list of integers `odds` and an integer `n` as input. It constructs a list `a` of size `n` such that the middle element (or elements) are filled with the values from `odds`, and for each pair of symmetric indices, their values are equal. The first half of the list is mirrored in the second half, except for the middle element if `n` is odd. If `odds` is an empty list, the resulting list `a` will also be empty.
