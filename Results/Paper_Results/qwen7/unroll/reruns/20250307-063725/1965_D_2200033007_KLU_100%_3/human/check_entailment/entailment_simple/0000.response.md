### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to recover a palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums, excluding one sum. The key insight is that the array `a` must be a palindrome, meaning `a[i] = a[n-1-i]` for all `1 ≤ i ≤ n`.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: Generates all possible subarray sums from the given list `a` and returns them sorted.
   - **func_2**: Removes duplicates from the list of subarray sums, leaving only unique sums.
   - **func_3**: Constructs a palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. It ensures that the array is symmetric around its center.
   - **func_4**: Removes the last element from both `bigList` and `smallList` until they differ, then returns the last element of `bigList`.

3. **Program Flow**:
   - The main program processes each test case.
   - It sorts the subarray sums and removes duplicates using `func_2`.
   - Depending on the number of unique sums, it either directly constructs the palindrome array or uses additional functions to handle edge cases.
   - Finally, it prints the recovered palindrome array.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles both even and odd lengths of the array `a`.
   - It ensures that the constructed array is a palindrome by mirroring the elements around the center.
   - The logic for handling the missing sum and constructing the palindrome array seems sound, given the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies the missing sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the provided ones.
   - It constructs the palindrome array by ensuring symmetry and correctness of the elements.
   - The use of `func_3` and `func_4` ensures that the array is built correctly and efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
