Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.
