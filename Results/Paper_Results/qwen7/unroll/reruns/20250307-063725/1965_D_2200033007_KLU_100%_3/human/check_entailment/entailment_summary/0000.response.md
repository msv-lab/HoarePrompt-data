Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic in each function aligns with the problem description and the overall goal of recovering a valid palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all possible subarray sums for a given list `a` and returns them sorted. This part is correct as it ensures we have all possible subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function removes duplicates from the list of subarray sums. This is necessary because the missing sum might be a duplicate of another sum, and removing duplicates helps in identifying the unique sums correctly.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function reconstructs the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums. It correctly fills the array by mirroring the values around the center. This function is crucial as it directly constructs the palindrome array based on the unique subarray sums.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function removes matching elements from the end of two lists until they differ, then returns the last element of the first list. This function is used to find the missing subarray sum by comparing the generated subarray sums with the given ones.

Given the execution summary and the problem constraints, the main logic in the main program seems to correctly identify the missing subarray sum and reconstruct the palindrome array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the main program works:

- It first sorts the subarray sums.
- It identifies the missing sum using the functions `func_3` and `func_4`.
- It appends the missing sum back to the list of unique subarray sums.
- Finally, it reconstructs the palindrome array using `func_3`.

Since the problem guarantees that there is always at least one valid solution and the functions are designed to handle the required operations correctly, the overall logic appears sound.

Correctness: **True**
