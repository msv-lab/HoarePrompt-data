Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `odds`, which is a list of integers, and a parameter `n`, which is an integer representing the size of the array `a`. It returns a list `a` where the middle element (if `n` is odd) or the elements around the center (if `n` is even) are filled with the values from `odds`, and for each pair of symmetric indices, their values are equal. The first half of the list is mirrored in the second half, except for the middle element if `n` is odd. Since `odds` is an empty list, the list `a` will also be empty.**
