Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, bigList and smallList. bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums of a palindrome array, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of the same palindrome array, with the last element of bigList being equal to the last element of smallList. The function returns the last element of bigList, which is different from the last element of smallList.**
