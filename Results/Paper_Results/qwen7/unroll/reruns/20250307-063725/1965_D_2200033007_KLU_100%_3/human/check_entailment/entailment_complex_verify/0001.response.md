### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates all subarray sums of the input list `a` and returns a sorted list of these sums.
   - The function iterates through each starting index `i` and accumulates the sum of subarrays starting from `i` to the end of the list.
   - The results are stored in `cts`, which is then sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function identifies unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of the sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (removing the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum `ct` to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reconstructs the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It sets the middle element (or the two middle elements if `n` is even) using the first element of `odds`.
   - For subsequent elements, it calculates the value needed to maintain the palindrome property by ensuring the sum of subarrays matches the given unique sums.
   - The function ensures that the first half of the array is mirrored in the second half, except for the middle element if `n` is odd.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems redundant.
   - It attempts to remove the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` if they are equal, but it is not utilized in the main logic.

### Analysis:
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` collectively aim to identify the unique subarray sums and use them to reconstruct a valid palindrome array.
- The logic in `func_3` ensures that the reconstructed array is a palindrome by mirroring the first half in the second half.
- The approach should work correctly for the provided problem description, as it handles the constraints and properties of palindromic arrays.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- In `func_3`, the logic for setting the middle element (or elements) is flawed. The function assumes that the first element of `odds` can be directly used to set the middle element(s), which might not always be true. For example, if the first element of `odds` is a sum that cannot be split into two equal halves, the palindrome property might be violated.
- The function `func_4` is not used, but its presence suggests that it might have been intended to handle some edge cases or additional logic, which is currently unused.

Given these observations, the original assessment might be slightly off due to the potential flaw in `func_3`.

### Conclusion:
While the overall approach is correct, there is a potential flaw in how the middle element(s) are set in `func_3`, which could lead to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
