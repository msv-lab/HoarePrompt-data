Output State: **smallList contains one less element than it initially did, and its last element is different from the last element of bigList.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are the same. In each iteration, both `bigList` and `smallList` have their last elements removed. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `bigList` will be exactly one element longer than `smallList`, and the last element of `bigList` will no longer be equal to the last element of `smallList`.
