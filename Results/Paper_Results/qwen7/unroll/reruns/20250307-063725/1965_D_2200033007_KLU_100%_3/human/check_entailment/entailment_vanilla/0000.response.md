### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the sum of all subarrays of the input list `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and accumulates the sum of subarrays starting from `i` to the end of the list.
   - The results are stored in `cts`, which is then sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of the sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (removing the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum `ct` to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reconstructs the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It sets the middle element (or the two middle elements if `n` is even) using the first element of `odds`.
   - For subsequent elements, it calculates the value needed to maintain the palindrome property by ensuring the sum of subarrays matches the given unique sums.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems redundant.
   - It attempts to remove the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` if they are equal, but it is not utilized in the main logic.

### Analysis:
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` collectively aim to identify the unique subarray sums and use them to reconstruct a valid palindrome array.
- Given the constraints and the nature of palindromes, the approach should work correctly for the provided problem description.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to recover a possible palindrome array from the given subarray sums.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
