Output State: `a` is a list where the middle element (if `n` is odd) or the elements around the center (if `n` is even) are filled with the values from `odds`, and for each pair of symmetric indices, their values are equal. The first half of the list is mirrored in the second half, except for the middle element if `n` is odd. `odds` is an empty list, `prev` is the last value of `x` in `odds`, and `idx` is -1.
