The function `func_4` accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`. It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. After the loop ends, the function returns the last element of `bigList`, ensuring it is different from the last element of `smallList`.
