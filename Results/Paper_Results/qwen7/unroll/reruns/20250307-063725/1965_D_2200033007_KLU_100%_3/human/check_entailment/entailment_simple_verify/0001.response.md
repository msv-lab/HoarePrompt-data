### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calculates all possible subarray sums of the input list `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and accumulates the sum of subarrays starting from `i` to the end of the list.
   - The results are stored in `cts`, which is then sorted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It uses a list `odds` to keep track of the sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (removing the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum `ct` to `odds`.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where the input list `cts` might contain negative sums or zero, which could lead to incorrect results if the input list contains such elements.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reconstructs the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It sets the middle element (or the two middle elements if `n` is even) using the first element of `odds`.
   - For subsequent elements, it calculates the value needed to maintain the palindrome property by ensuring the sum of subarrays matches the given unique sums.
   - The function correctly handles the reconstruction of the palindrome array, but it assumes that the unique subarray sums are sufficient to determine the entire array, which is not always true.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems redundant.
   - It attempts to remove the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList` if they are equal, but it is not utilized in the main logic.

### Analysis:
- The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` collectively aim to identify the unique subarray sums and use them to reconstruct a valid palindrome array.
- However, the function `func_2` does not handle the case where the input list `cts` might contain negative sums or zero, which could lead to incorrect results if the input list contains such elements.
- Additionally, the function `func_3` assumes that the unique subarray sums are sufficient to determine the entire array, which is not always true. For example, if the unique subarray sums do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the array, the function may produce an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has issues with handling negative sums or zero in the input list and may not always produce a correct palindrome array if the unique subarray sums do not provide enough information to uniquely determine the array.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The program is not guaranteed to be correct in all cases due to the potential issues with handling negative sums or zero in the input list and the assumption that the unique subarray sums are sufficient to determine the entire array.
