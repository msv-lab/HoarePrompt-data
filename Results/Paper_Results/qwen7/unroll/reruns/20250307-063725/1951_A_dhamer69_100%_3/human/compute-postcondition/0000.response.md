Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input (converted to an integer) to the variable `t`. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
