Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration where `n` and `s` are provided as inputs. Specifically, if `n` equals 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'. For other values of `n`, it checks if the count of '1's in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' with two '1's in total, printing 'NO' in these cases; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
