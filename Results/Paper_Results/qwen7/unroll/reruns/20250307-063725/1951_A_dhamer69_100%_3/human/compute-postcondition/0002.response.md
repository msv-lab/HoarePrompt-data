Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration where `n` and `s` are provided as inputs.

For each iteration of the loop:
- If `n` equals 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not 2, it checks if the number of '1's in `s` is odd, then prints 'NO'. If the number of '1's is even, it further checks if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and the count of '1's is exactly 2, in which case it prints 'NO'. In all other cases, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings corresponding to each iteration's condition evaluation.
