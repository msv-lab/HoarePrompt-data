Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program `func` does not match the problem description given in the comment above it. The comment suggests that the program should be generating `.py` files from `.html` files within specified directories, but the actual implementation of `func` reads input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the input string `s`. This function does not generate any files and does not interact with directories or HTML files as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the provided problem description.
