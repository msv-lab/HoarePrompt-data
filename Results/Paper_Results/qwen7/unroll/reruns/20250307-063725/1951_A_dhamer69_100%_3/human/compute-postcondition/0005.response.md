Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it reads two integers \( n \) and a string \( s \). If \( n \) is 2 and \( s \) is '00', it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if the number of '1's in \( s \) is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' with two '1's in total, in which case it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
