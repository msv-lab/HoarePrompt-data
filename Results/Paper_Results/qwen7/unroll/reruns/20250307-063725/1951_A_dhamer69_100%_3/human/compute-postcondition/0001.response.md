Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while t > 0:`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer.
   - `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the state of `t`**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer, we cannot directly change its value. However, we can express the required condition based on the given information.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` must be greater than 0**
