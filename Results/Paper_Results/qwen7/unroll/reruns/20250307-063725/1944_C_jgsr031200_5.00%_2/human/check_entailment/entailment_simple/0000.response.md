### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the resulting array `c`. Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The key insight is that Alice can always pick elements in such a way that the MEX of the final array `c` is maximized. This can be achieved by ensuring that the smallest missing integer in `c` is as large as possible.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not match the problem description. It includes unnecessary functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not used in solving the problem.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the MEX of the array `c` based on the optimal moves of Alice and Bob.
   - The logic in `func_1` iterates through the array `arr` and tries to find the smallest integer that is not present in the array. However, this approach does not correctly simulate the game dynamics between Alice and Bob.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice will always try to pick elements in such a way that the smallest missing integer in `c` is maximized.
   - Bob will remove elements from `a` without affecting the MEX calculation directly since he only removes elements.
   - The optimal strategy for Alice is to ensure that the smallest missing integer is as large as possible by picking elements strategically.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately reflect the game dynamics.

### Correctness:
**False**
