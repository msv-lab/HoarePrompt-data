The function accepts a list `arr` of non-negative integers and returns either a value or prints a value based on the elements in the list. Specifically, it iterates through the list, marking visited indices and decrementing their values. If it finds a sequence where the next index is valid and not visited, it continues; otherwise, it prints and returns the current index plus one. If it completes the loop without finding such a sequence, it prints and returns the current index.
