Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to counting consecutive elements, which is not relevant to the game described.

The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players play optimally. However, the given code does not simulate the game properly. It seems to be attempting to find the smallest missing number in a sequence, but it does not handle the turns of Alice and Bob as described.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

The expected output is `2`, as explained in the example. However, the provided code will not produce the correct result because it does not simulate the game correctly. The code tries to find the smallest missing number in the sequence of counts, which is not the intended solution for this game.

A correct implementation would simulate the game turns and keep track of the elements picked by Alice and Bob, ensuring that the MEX is calculated based on the final state of `c`.
