Reasoning:
The given program is intended to solve the problem by determining the optimal moves for Alice and Bob to achieve the game's score (MEX of array `c`). However, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to achieve this goal. Let's break down the issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` does not simulate the game's turns properly. It simply checks for the presence of consecutive numbers in the array and prints the first missing number it encounters. This does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

2. **Misinterpretation of Game Rules**: The function does not simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking and removing elements from the array `a`. Instead, it seems to be checking for gaps in a sequence of numbers, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

3. **Missing Game Logic**: There is no logic to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, nor any mechanism to ensure that Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob removes elements directly from `a`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
