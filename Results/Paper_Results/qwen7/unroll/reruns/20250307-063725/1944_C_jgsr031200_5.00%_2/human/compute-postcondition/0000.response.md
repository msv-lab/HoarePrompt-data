Output State: **arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\); nums is a Counter object containing the count of each element in arr.**

Explanation: The code `nums = collections.Counter(arr)` creates a `Counter` object named `nums` that counts the occurrences of each element in the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, and now `nums` holds the frequency of each element in `arr`.
