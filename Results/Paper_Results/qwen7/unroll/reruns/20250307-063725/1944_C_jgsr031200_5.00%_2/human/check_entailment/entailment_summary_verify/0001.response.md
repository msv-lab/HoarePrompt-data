### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob removes elements directly from `a`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob will remove the largest available number to minimize the MEX. This means Alice will try to keep the smallest numbers in `c`, and Bob will remove the largest numbers from `a`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code uses a `Counter` to track the frequency of each number in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers starting from `0` and tries to find the smallest number that is still present in `arr`.
   - If the current number `start` is still in `arr`, it is added to the `vis` set and removed from the counter.
   - If the next number (`start + 1`) is also present, it continues to the next number.
   - If no such number is found, it prints the current `start + 1` as the MEX.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code attempts to simulate the optimal strategy for both players.
   - However, there are several issues with the implementation:
     - The code does not handle the scenario where Alice and Bob play optimally. Instead, it simply iterates through the numbers and checks if they are present in the array.
     - The code does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob will play optimally, meaning Alice will always pick the smallest available number, and Bob will remove the largest available number.
     - The code does not ensure that the smallest missing number is identified correctly. For example, if the array is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, the code will incorrectly identify the MEX as `4` instead of `1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code does not handle the edge cases where the smallest number might not be present in the array correctly. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`, the code will incorrectly identify the MEX as `3` instead of `0`.
   - The code does not handle the case where the array contains duplicates correctly. For example, if the array is `[0, 0, 1, 1]`, the code will incorrectly identify the MEX as `2` instead of `0`.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not accurately implement the optimal strategy for both players. It simply iterates through the numbers and checks if they are present in the array, which does not reflect the optimal play of both players.

### Final Answer:
