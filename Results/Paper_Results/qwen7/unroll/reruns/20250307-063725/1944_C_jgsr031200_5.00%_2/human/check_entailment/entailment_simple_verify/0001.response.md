### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` of size `n`. Alice picks elements and appends them to her array `c`, while Bob removes elements directly from `a`. The goal is to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of `c` at the end of the game.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The key insight is that Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob will remove the largest available number to minimize the MEX. This means Alice will try to keep the smallest numbers in `c`, and Bob will remove the largest numbers from `a`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code attempts to solve the problem using a counter (`nums`) to track the frequency of each number in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the numbers starting from `0` and tries to find the smallest number that is still present in `arr`.
   - If the current number `start` is still in `arr`, it is added to the `vis` set and removed from the counter.
   - If the next number (`start + 1`) is also present, it continues to the next number.
   - If no such number is found, it prints the current `start + 1` as the MEX.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code correctly simulates the optimal strategy for both players.
   - Alice will always append the smallest available number to `c`, and Bob will remove the largest available number from `a`.
   - The loop ensures that the smallest missing number is identified, which aligns with the definition of MEX.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation. The code assumes that the smallest number will always be present in the array, but this is not guaranteed. For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 2, 2]`. According to the optimal strategy, Alice should pick `0` (the smallest missing number), but the code will not handle this case correctly because `0` is not in the array.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles arrays where the smallest number is not present (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 2]`), but it fails to handle the case where the smallest number is not in the array at all (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 2]`).
   - The code also correctly identifies the MEX even when the array contains duplicates (e.g., `[0, 0, 1, 1]`), but it does not account for the scenario where the smallest number is not present.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not accurately implement the optimal strategy for both players in all cases. Specifically, it fails to handle the scenario where the smallest number is not present in the array.

### Final Answer:
