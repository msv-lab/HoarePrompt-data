Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `start`.

2. **Understand the condition of the loop**: The loop continues as long as `nums.get(start, 0)` is truthy (i.e., non-zero).

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must be non-zero.
   - Since `start` is currently 0, we need to check if `nums[0]` (or `nums.get(0)`) is non-zero.

Given that `start` is 0, the loop will execute the first time if `nums[0]` is non-zero. Therefore, we need to ensure that `nums[0]` is non-zero.

5. **Final state**:
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.
   - `nums[0]` must be non-zero.

Thus, the final state right before the loop should be:

State: **`start` is 0, `vis` is an empty set, and `nums[0]` must be non-zero**
