### Reasoning:

The annotated program provided seems to be incomplete and contains unnecessary functions that do not relate to solving the problem at hand. However, the core logic of the `func_1` function appears to be attempting to solve the problem correctly, albeit with some issues.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the logic within `func_1`:

1. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses `c.Counter(arr)` to count the occurrences of each number in the array `arr`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `start` to 0 and a set `vis` to keep track of visited numbers.

3. **Main Loop**: The loop runs as long as there are still occurrences of the current `start` value in the counter. Inside the loop:
   - It marks the current `start` value as visited by adding it to the `vis` set.
   - It decrements the count of `start` in the counter.
   - If the next consecutive number (`start + 1`) exists and has not been visited, it moves to the next number.
   - If no such consecutive number exists, it prints and returns `start + 1`.

4. **Final Print**: If the loop completes without finding a sequence where the next index is valid and not visited, it prints and returns the current `start`.

### Issues with the Provided Code:

1. **Logic for Handling Visited Numbers**: The logic for handling visited numbers is somewhat unclear. The code should ensure that each number from 0 to `n-1` is considered and marked as visited appropriately.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the array might contain duplicate values or specific patterns that could affect the MEX calculation.

3. **Optimality**: The provided solution does not fully account for the optimal strategies of both players. It assumes a simple traversal and marking of numbers, which may not always yield the optimal result.

### Correct Solution:

Given the problem statement and the need to find the optimal MEX, a more appropriate approach would involve sorting the array and then determining the smallest missing non-negative integer.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    arr.sort()
    
    mex = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num > mex:
            break
    
    print(mex)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        func_1(arr)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sort the array to facilitate easy identification of the smallest missing non-negative integer.
2. **Iterate Through Sorted Array**: Iterate through the sorted array and check for the smallest missing integer.
3. **Determine MEX**: Increment `mex` until you find a number in the array that is greater than `mex`. The value of `mex` at this point is the MEX of the array.

### Conclusion:

The provided code snippet is incorrect due to its flawed logic and lack of proper handling of the problem constraints. The corrected solution above addresses these issues and provides the correct approach to finding the MEX under optimal play conditions.

**Correctness: **False**
