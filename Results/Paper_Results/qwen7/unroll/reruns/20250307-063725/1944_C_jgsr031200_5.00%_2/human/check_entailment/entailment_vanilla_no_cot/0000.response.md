Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The game involves two different types of moves by Alice and Bob, and the solution provided does not account for these differences in turns or the strategic placement of numbers in the resulting array `c`.

The given code attempts to solve the problem using a counter and a set to track visited numbers, but it does not simulate the turns taken by Alice and Bob or calculate the MEX of the final array `c` correctly. Instead, it seems to be trying to find the smallest missing number in a sequence, which is not directly related to the game's rules.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to simulate the game according to the rules provided, ensuring that Alice and Bob make their optimal moves, and then compute the MEX of the final array `c`.
