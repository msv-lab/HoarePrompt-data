The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `x` of `n-1` integers. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum sequence starting with 1000, and prints the result as a space-separated string. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of lists, each representing the cumulative sum sequence for the respective test case, with each list starting with 1000 followed by the cumulative sums of the input integers.
