Output State: **The output will be a series of lists, each representing the cumulative sum sequence for the respective test case. Each list will start with 1000, followed by the cumulative sums of the input integers for that test case.**

To break it down further:
- For each test case (determined by the value of `t`), the program reads an integer `n` and a line of space-separated integers.
- It then calculates a list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the input integers, starting with 1000.
- Finally, it prints the list `a` as a space-separated string for each test case.
- After all test cases are processed, the output consists of multiple lines, each line representing the output for one test case.
