You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. Additionally, a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n is provided where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1} for all i.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the remaining fuel `f` after processing each test case.
    #
    #To break it down:
    #- For each test case, the loop reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list of `n` integers `ls`.
    #- It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element, updating the fuel `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`.
    #- If `f` is greater than 0 after processing the entire list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
    #- This process repeats until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop ends.
    #
    #The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" strings corresponding to each test case processed within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), along with a list of \( n \) integers. It then calculates the remaining fuel \( f \) after traveling through the list, subtracting the minimum of \( a \times (m_i - m_{i-1}) \) or \( b \) for each segment between consecutive elements in the list. If the remaining fuel \( f \) is greater than 0 after processing all segments, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for each test case until all test cases are processed. The final output consists of a series of "YES" or "NO" strings corresponding to each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message sending times `ls`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes the remaining charge `f` and iterates through the list of message sending times.
   - For each pair of consecutive message sending times, it calculates the minimum cost between turning off and on the phone (`b`) and letting the phone run until the next message (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`).
   - It updates the remaining charge `f` accordingly.
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where turning off and on the phone might be more expensive than just letting the phone run continuously.
   - The logic ensures that the phone's charge is updated correctly for each message sending time.
   - The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `1 3 1 5` and `[3]`
  - Initial charge: 3
  - Message at moment 3
  - Cost: `max(3 - 1 * (3 - 0), 5) = 3` (since 3 - 3 = 0, no need to turn off)
  - Remaining charge: 0
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 2**: `7 21 1 3` and `[4, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 26]`
  - Initial charge: 21
  - Process each interval:
    - `[4, 6]`: `max(21 - 1 * (6 - 4), 3) = 19`
    - `[6, 10]`: `max(19 - 1 * (10 - 6), 3) = 15`
    - `[10, 13]`: `max(15 - 1 * (13 - 10), 3) = 11`
    - `[13, 17]`: `max(11 - 1 * (17 - 13), 3) = 7`
    - `[17, 20]`: `max(7 - 1 * (20 - 17), 3) = 3`
    - `[20, 26]`: `max(3 - 1 * (26 - 20), 3) = 0`
  - Remaining charge: 0
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 3**: `5 10 1 2` and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial charge: 10
  - Process each interval:
    - `[1, 2]`: `max(10 - 1 * (2 - 1), 2) = 8`
    - `[2, 3]`: `max(8 - 1 * (3 - 2), 2) = 6`
    - `[3, 4]`: `max(6 - 1 * (4 - 3), 2) = 4`
    - `[4, 5]`: `max(4 - 1 * (5 - 4), 2) = 2`
  - Remaining charge: 2
  - Output: `YES`

- **Example 4**: `1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000` and `[1000000000]`
  - Initial charge: 1000000000
  - Message at moment 1000000000
  - Cost: `max(1000000000 - 1000000000 * (1000000000 - 0), 1000000000) = 0`
  - Remaining charge: 0
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 5**: `3 11 9 6` and `[6, 8, 10]`
  - Initial charge: 11
  - Process each interval:
    - `[6, 8]`: `max(11 - 9 * (8 - 6), 6) = 2`
    - `[8, 10]`: `max(2 - 9 * (10 - 8), 6) = -16` (turn off and on)
  - Remaining charge: -16
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 6**: Large intervals with potential overflow
  - The program correctly handles large intervals and avoids overflow by using the `min` function to choose the cheaper option.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It handles edge cases and large inputs appropriately.
