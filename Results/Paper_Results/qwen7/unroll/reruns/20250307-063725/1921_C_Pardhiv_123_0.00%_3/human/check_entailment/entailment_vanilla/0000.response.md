Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message sending times `ls`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - The program initializes the remaining charge `f` and iterates through the list of message sending times.
   - For each pair of consecutive message sending times, it calculates the minimum cost between turning off and on the phone (`b`) and letting the phone run until the next message (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`).
   - It updates the remaining charge `f` accordingly.
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0. If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the scenario where turning off and on the phone might be more expensive than just letting the phone run continuously.
   - The logic ensures that the phone's charge is updated correctly for each message sending time.
   - The program handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1**: `1 3 1 5` and `[3]`
  - Initial charge: 3
  - Message at moment 3
  - Cost: `max(3 - 1 * (3 - 0), 5) = 3` (since 3 - 3 = 0, no need to turn off)
  - Remaining charge: 0
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 2**: `7 21 1 3` and `[4, 6, 10, 13, 17, 20, 26]`
  - Initial charge: 21
  - Process each interval:
    - `[4, 6]`: `max(21 - 1 * (6 - 4), 3) = 19`
    - `[6, 10]`: `max(19 - 1 * (10 - 6), 3) = 15`
    - `[10, 13]`: `max(15 - 1 * (13 - 10), 3) = 11`
    - `[13, 17]`: `max(11 - 1 * (17 - 13), 3) = 7`
    - `[17, 20]`: `max(7 - 1 * (20 - 17), 3) = 3`
    - `[20, 26]`: `max(3 - 1 * (26 - 20), 3) = 0`
  - Remaining charge: 0
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 3**: `5 10 1 2` and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Initial charge: 10
  - Process each interval:
    - `[1, 2]`: `max(10 - 1 * (2 - 1), 2) = 8`
    - `[2, 3]`: `max(8 - 1 * (3 - 2), 2) = 6`
    - `[3, 4]`: `max(6 - 1 * (4 - 3), 2) = 4`
    - `[4, 5]`: `max(4 - 1 * (5 - 4), 2) = 2`
  - Remaining charge: 2
  - Output: `YES`

- **Example 4**: `1 1000000000 1000000000 1000000000` and `[1000000000]`
  - Initial charge: 1000000000
  - Message at moment 1000000000
  - Cost: `max(1000000000 - 1000000000 * (1000000000 - 0), 1000000000) = 0`
  - Remaining charge: 0
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 5**: `3 11 9 6` and `[6, 8, 10]`
  - Initial charge: 11
  - Process each interval:
    - `[6, 8]`: `max(11 - 9 * (8 - 6), 6) = 2`
    - `[8, 10]`: `max(2 - 9 * (10 - 8), 6) = -16` (turn off and on)
  - Remaining charge: -16
  - Output: `NO`

- **Example 6**: Large intervals with potential overflow
  - The program correctly handles large intervals and avoids overflow by using the `min` function to choose the cheaper option.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It handles edge cases and large inputs appropriately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
