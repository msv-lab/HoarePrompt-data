Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the remaining fuel `f` after processing each test case.

To break it down:
- For each test case, the loop reads four integers `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list of `n` integers `ls`.
- It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element, updating the fuel `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`.
- If `f` is greater than 0 after processing the entire list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
- This process repeats until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop ends.

The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" strings corresponding to each test case processed within the loop.
