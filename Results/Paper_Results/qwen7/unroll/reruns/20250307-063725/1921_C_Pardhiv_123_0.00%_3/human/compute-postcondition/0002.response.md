Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the evaluation of each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the program reads values for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `ls`. It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element, updating the variable `f` by subtracting the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`) at each step. If `f` remains positive after processing all elements in `ls`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the initial value provided by the user. Each iteration's outcome ('YES' or 'NO') contributes to the final output state.
