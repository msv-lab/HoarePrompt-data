The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), along with a list of \( n \) integers. It then calculates the remaining fuel \( f \) after traveling through the list, subtracting the minimum of \( a \times (m_i - m_{i-1}) \) or \( b \) for each segment between consecutive elements in the list. If the remaining fuel \( f \) is greater than 0 after processing all segments, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for each test case until all test cases are processed. The final output consists of a series of "YES" or "NO" strings corresponding to each test case.
