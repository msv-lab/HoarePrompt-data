Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge becomes zero or negative during the process of sending messages. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the phone might lose more charge than available when turning it off and on between messages.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
3 10 5 3
1 6 11
```
- Expected Output:
```
NO
```
- Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the phone starts with 10 units of charge. The first message is sent at moment 1, which consumes \(5 \times (1 - 0) = 5\) units of charge, leaving 5 units. Turning off and on consumes 3 units, leaving 2 units. Sending the second message at moment 6 consumes \(5 \times (6 - 1) = 25\) units, but the phone only has 2 units left, which is insufficient. Therefore, the correct output should be "NO".

The program fails to handle this scenario because it does not properly update the charge level when turning off and on the phone, leading to incorrect results in cases where the charge becomes zero or negative.
