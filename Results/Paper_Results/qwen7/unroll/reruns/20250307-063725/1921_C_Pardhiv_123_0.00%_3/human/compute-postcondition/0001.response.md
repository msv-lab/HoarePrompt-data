State right before the while loop: `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and the input is guaranteed to be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `t` will always be greater than 0.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.
