Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a tree represented by an adjacency list. For each test case, it determines the maximum length of the largest connected component that can be obtained after making no more than `k` cuts, using a binary search approach combined with a depth-first search (DFS) traversal. After completing the binary search for each test case, it prints the value of `L`, which represents the maximum length of the cut under the given constraints.**
