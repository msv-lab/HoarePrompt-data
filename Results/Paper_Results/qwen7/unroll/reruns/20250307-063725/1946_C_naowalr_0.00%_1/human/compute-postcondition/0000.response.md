Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(sys.stdin.readline())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n`, `k`, `adj`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover` remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` now holds the value read from standard input, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while the other variables (`n`, `k`, `adj`, `x`, `numCuts`, and `leftover`) retain their previous states.
