t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The adjacency list adj represents a tree where adj[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex i. The variable x is the midpoint of the binary search range [L, R], and numCuts keeps track of the number of edges removed during the DFS traversal. The variable leftover represents the size of the largest connected component after removing the edges.
