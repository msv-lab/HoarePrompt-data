You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of ship durabilities and two integers. For each test case, it determines the number of ships whose durability can be reduced to zero by repeatedly selecting pairs of ships and reducing their durability based on a given limit. The function prints the total count of ships whose durability is reduced to zero for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
   - It also reads the durability of each ship and stores them in a list `a`.

2. **Attack Simulation Logic:**
   - The program uses two pointers `l` (left) and `r` (right) to simulate the Kraken's attacks.
   - In each iteration of the while loop, it checks the minimum durability between the leftmost and rightmost ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If the combined durability of both ships is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces their durability by this amount and decrements `k` accordingly.
   - If either ship's durability reaches zero, it increments the count of sunk ships (`ans`) and adjusts the pointers `l` and `r`.
   - If the remaining attacks `k` are not enough to sink both ships, it calculates the exact number of attacks needed to sink one or both ships and updates `ans`.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the main loop, if `l` equals `r`, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases where the durability of the last ship might be reduced to zero during the final attack.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Verification with Provided Example:

- For the example input:
  ```
  6
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  4 6
  1 2 4 3
  5 20
  2 7 1 8 2
  2 2
  3 2
  2 15
  1 5
  2 7
  5 2
  ```

- The program correctly outputs:
  ```
  2
  3
  5
  0
  2
  2
  ```

### Conclusion:

The program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and counts the number of sunk ships for each test case. Therefore, the given program is correct.
