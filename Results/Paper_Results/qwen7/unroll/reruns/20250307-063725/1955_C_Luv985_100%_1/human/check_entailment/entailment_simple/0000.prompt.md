Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The value of `ans` will be the total number of elements in the list `a` that become zero after performing the specified operations for each pair of indices `(l, r)` as described in the loop.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the process:
    #
    #1. For each test case (`T`), we read two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers.
    #2. We initialize two pointers `l` and `r` at the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
    #3. We also initialize `ans` to count how many elements in `a` become zero.
    #4. In the inner while loop, we perform operations on the elements at positions `l` and `r` until either `l` equals `r` or `k` becomes zero.
    #   - If the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` times 2 is less than or equal to `k`, we subtract this minimum value from both `a[l]` and `a[r]`, reduce `k` accordingly, and increment `ans` if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes zero.
    #   - Otherwise, we adjust `k` using modulo and integer division, and check if `a[l]` can be reduced to zero with the remaining `k`. If so, we increment `ans`.
    #5. If `l` equals `r` and there's still some `k` left, we check if `a[l]` can be reduced to zero with the remaining `k`.
    #6. Finally, we print the value of `ans`.
    #
    #The output state is the final value of `ans`, which represents the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to zero after all possible operations.
