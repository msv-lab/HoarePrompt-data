Output State: **`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial states.**

This means that the variable `T` is now set to an integer input value within the specified range, while `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
