You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the process:
    #
    #1. For each test case (`T`), we read two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers.
    #2. We initialize two pointers `l` and `r` at the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
    #3. We also initialize `ans` to count how many elements in `a` become zero.
    #4. In the inner while loop, we perform operations on the elements at positions `l` and `r` until either `l` equals `r` or `k` becomes zero.
    #   - If the minimum of `a[l]` and `a[r]` times 2 is less than or equal to `k`, we subtract this minimum value from both `a[l]` and `a[r]`, reduce `k` accordingly, and increment `ans` if either `a[l]` or `a[r]` becomes zero.
    #   - Otherwise, we adjust `k` using modulo and integer division, and check if `a[l]` can be reduced to zero with the remaining `k`. If so, we increment `ans`.
    #5. If `l` equals `r` and there's still some `k` left, we check if `a[l]` can be reduced to zero with the remaining `k`.
    #6. Finally, we print the value of `ans`.
    #
    #The output state is the final value of `ans`, which represents the total number of elements in `a` that have been reduced to zero after all possible operations.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where a ship's durability is reduced to zero but still needs to be considered in future attacks. Let's consider the following example:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

### Explanation:
In the given example, the initial durability of the ships is `[1, 2, 4, 3]`. The Kraken attacks 5 times in the specified order.

1. **First Attack:** The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to `0` and making it sink. Now, the list is `[0, 2, 4, 3]`.
2. **Second Attack:** The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to `2` and making it sink. Now, the list is `[0, 2, 4, 0]`.
3. **Third Attack:** The Kraken attacks the first ship again, which has already sunk, so no change. The list remains `[0, 2, 4, 0]`.
4. **Fourth Attack:** The Kraken attacks the last ship again, reducing its durability to `2` and making it sink. Now, the list is `[0, 2, 4, 0]`.
5. **Fifth Attack:** The Kraken attacks the first ship again, which has already sunk, so no change. The list remains `[0, 2, 4, 0]`.

After these attacks, two ships (`[1, 3]`) have sunk, but the program incorrectly outputs `0`, indicating that no ships have sunk. This is because the program does not properly handle the sinking of ships and their subsequent removal from the attack sequence.

Thus, the program fails to correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks and does not account for ships that have already sunk. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
