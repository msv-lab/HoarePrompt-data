The only variable in the loop head is `T`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be non-zero.

Given that `T` is assigned the value of an integer input from the user and is guaranteed to be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4, no adjustment is necessary because the condition `T` is already ensured to be true based on the problem statement.

However, to strictly follow the format and provide a clear answer:

State: **`T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 10^4**
