The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (size of the grid), an integer k (number of moves), and k pairs of integers (r, c) representing row and column moves. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to achieve a specific configuration on a grid of size n x n, based on the given moves. If the number of ways is zero, it prints 0; if one, it prints 1; otherwise, it computes the result using dynamic programming and prints it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
