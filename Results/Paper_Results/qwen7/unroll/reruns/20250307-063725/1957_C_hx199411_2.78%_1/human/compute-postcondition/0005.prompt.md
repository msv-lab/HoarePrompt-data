You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves you made are valid according to the problem description.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will depend on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. Specifically, it will be determined by the values of `n`, `k`, and the subsequent inputs for `c` and `r`. The final output will be one of the following based on the value of `m = n - num`:
    #
    #- If `m == 0`, it will print `0`.
    #- If `m == 1`, it will print `1`.
    #- Otherwise, it will compute a dynamic programming solution to find the number of ways to achieve `m` using a specific formula and print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    #
    #The exact output cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each iteration, but the process described above will be followed for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and lists of integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing row and column moves. For each test case, it returns either an error message indicating invalid input or a result based on the validity of the moves.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
