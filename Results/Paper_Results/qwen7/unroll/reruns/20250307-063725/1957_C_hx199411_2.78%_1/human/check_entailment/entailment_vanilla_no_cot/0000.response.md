Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations of the chessboard after the given moves. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`.
3. **Tracking Mirrored Moves**: It tracks whether a move was mirrored (`c == r`), which affects the number of available positions for subsequent moves.
4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations for the remaining empty spaces on the board. The states are defined based on the number of empty rows/columns left, and the transitions between states are handled correctly.
5. **Modulo Operation**: The calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring the results fit within standard integer limits.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps in the code, the program accurately computes the required output for each test case. Therefore, the provided solution is correct.
