### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` that have already been played.
   - It then reads `k` moves and determines how many of these moves are mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).

2. **Calculation of Remaining Moves:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of mirrored moves. Each mirrored move reduces the number of independent moves by 1 because the computer cannot mirror this move.
   - The remaining number of independent moves is calculated as `m = n - num`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `m == 0`, there are no valid moves left, so the program prints `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one independent move, so the program prints `1`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining independent moves.
   - The base cases for the DP array are set correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` independent moves.
   - This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for each new independent move, it can either be placed in a new row or column or in a previously unused row/column combination, leading to the given formula.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of possible configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to correctly solve the problem as described.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly handles the input, calculates the remaining independent moves, and uses dynamic programming to determine the number of possible configurations. The logic and the implementation match the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
