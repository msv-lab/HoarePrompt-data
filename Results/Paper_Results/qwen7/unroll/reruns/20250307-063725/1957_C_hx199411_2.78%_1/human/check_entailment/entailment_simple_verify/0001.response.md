### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` that have already been played.
   - It then reads `k` moves and determines how many of these moves are mirrored (i.e., `c == r`).

2. **Calculation of Remaining Moves:**
   - The variable `num` is used to count the number of mirrored moves. Each mirrored move reduces the number of independent moves by 1 because the computer cannot mirror this move.
   - The remaining number of independent moves is calculated as `m = n - num`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - If `m == 0`, there are no valid moves left, so the program prints `0`.
   - If `m == 1`, there is exactly one independent move, so the program prints `1`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining independent moves.
   - The base cases for the DP array are set correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `i` independent moves.
   - This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for each new independent move, it can either be placed in a new row or column or in a previously unused row/column combination, leading to the given formula.

5. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the number of possible configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **State Before Function Call:** 
  - `t` is the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are the dimensions and number of moves for each test case, and `r_i` and `c_i` are the coordinates of the moves.
  
- **State After Input Processing:**
  - `num` counts the number of mirrored moves.
  - `m` calculates the remaining number of independent moves.
  - The DP array is initialized and filled using the recurrence relation.

- **DP Array Initialization:**
  - `dp[1] = 1` because with one independent move, there is only one way to place the rook.
  - `dp[2] = 3` because with two independent moves, there are three ways to place the rooks (either in different rows and columns, or in the same row or column but different positions).

- **DP Array Filling:**
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` ensures that each new independent move is counted correctly, considering all possible placements.

- **Output Calculation:**
  - The program correctly computes the number of possible configurations for the remaining independent moves and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately handles edge cases, uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations, and outputs the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The annotated code confirms that the program follows the correct steps and logic.
