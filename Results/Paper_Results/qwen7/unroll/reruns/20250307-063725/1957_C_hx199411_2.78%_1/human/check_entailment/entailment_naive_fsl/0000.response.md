Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the computer cannot mirror your move because `r = c`. According to the problem description, if `r = c`, the computer skips its turn. However, the current implementation always increments `num` by 2, regardless of whether `r` equals `c`.

For example, consider the following input:

```
8 1
7 6
```

In this case, since `r != c`, the program correctly increments `num` by 2. However, if the input were:

```
8 1
7 7
```

Here, `r = c`, so the computer should skip its turn. The program incorrectly increments `num` by 2, leading to an incorrect calculation of the number of possible final configurations.

To fix this, the program should check if `r == c` and only increment `num` by 1 in that case.
