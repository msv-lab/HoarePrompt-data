Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `t` (that it is an integer between 1 and 10^4) are preserved, and now `t` holds the specific value entered by the user within that range. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were not involved in the current operation.
