Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k` along with the positions of the rooks placed so far. This part is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program correctly handles the mirroring logic. If the rook is placed at `(r, c)` and `r != c`, it adds 2 to `num` (indicating two independent placements). If `r == c`, it adds 1 to `num` (indicating a single placement due to the mirroring rule).

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining empty cells. The base cases and the recurrence relation are correctly implemented. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is appropriate for calculating the number of configurations for `i` empty cells, considering the constraints and the problem requirements.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.

Given that the program follows the problem's requirements and constraints correctly, and the logic for handling the rook placements and the dynamic programming calculation is sound, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
