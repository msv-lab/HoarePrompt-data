Output State: The output state will depend on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. Specifically, it will be determined by the values of `n`, `k`, and the subsequent inputs for `c` and `r`. The final output will be one of the following based on the value of `m = n - num`:

- If `m == 0`, it will print `0`.
- If `m == 1`, it will print `1`.
- Otherwise, it will compute a dynamic programming solution to find the number of ways to achieve `m` using a specific formula and print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The exact output cannot be determined without knowing the specific inputs for each iteration, but the process described above will be followed for each iteration of the loop.
