Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard with the constraint that no two rooks can attack each other. Given \(k\) moves already made, the task is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after continuing the game.

2. **Key Logic**:
   - If a move \((r, c)\) is mirrored (i.e., \(r \neq c\)), it contributes 2 to the count of "free" positions (since both \((r, c)\) and \((c, r)\) are occupied).
   - If a move \((r, c)\) is not mirrored (i.e., \(r = c\)), it only occupies one unique position.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining free positions.
   - The base cases handle scenarios where the remaining positions are 0 or 1.
   - For more than one position, it uses a recurrence relation to build up the solution.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When no positions are left (\(m = 0\)), the number of configurations is 0.
   - When exactly one position is left (\(m = 1\)), the number of configurations is 1.
   - For more than one position, the recurrence relation ensures that all valid configurations are counted correctly.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers, ensuring the output fits within standard integer limits.

6. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases, processing each one independently.
   - It reads inputs, processes them according to the rules, and outputs the results as specified.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
