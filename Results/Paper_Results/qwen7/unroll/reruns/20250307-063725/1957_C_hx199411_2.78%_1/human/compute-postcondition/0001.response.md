Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `while t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: According to the given state, `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `t` is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\) (which means it is non-zero), no adjustment is necessary for `t` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
