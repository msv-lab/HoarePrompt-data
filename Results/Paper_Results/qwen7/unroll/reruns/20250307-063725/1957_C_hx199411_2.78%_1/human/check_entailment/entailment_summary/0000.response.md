Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the number of moves `k`.
3. It then iterates through the `k` moves, counting how many of them are diagonal moves (`c == r`) and how many are non-diagonal moves.
4. Based on the count of non-diagonal moves, it calculates the remaining empty positions on the grid.
5. If there are no remaining empty positions (`m == 0`), it correctly prints `0`.
6. If there is exactly one remaining empty position (`m == 1`), it correctly prints `1`.
7. For more than one remaining empty position, it uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. The base cases and recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming solution are correct.
8. The result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly, including edge cases and the dynamic programming solution.

Correctness: **True**
