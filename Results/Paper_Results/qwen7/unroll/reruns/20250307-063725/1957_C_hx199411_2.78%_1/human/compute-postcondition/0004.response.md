Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ n), and lists of integers r_i and c_i (1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n) representing row and column moves. For each test case, it returns either an error message indicating invalid input or a result based on the validity of the moves.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and move lists, and returns appropriate outputs based on the validity of the moves within the given constraints.
