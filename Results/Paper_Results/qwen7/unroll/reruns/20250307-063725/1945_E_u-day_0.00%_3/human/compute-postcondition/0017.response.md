Functionality: **The function determines whether the integer `k` is present in the permutation array `arr`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints `0` and exits. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the smallest index greater than or equal to `k` and `-1`. The function returns an integer indicating whether `k` was found (`0`) or not found (`1`).**
