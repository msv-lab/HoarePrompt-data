Postcondition: **The variable `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low] == k`, or -1 if no such index exists. The variable `st` contains all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, which are calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The variables `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the condition `if arr[mid] > k: high = mid; else: low = mid`, until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `pos` will be -1.**
