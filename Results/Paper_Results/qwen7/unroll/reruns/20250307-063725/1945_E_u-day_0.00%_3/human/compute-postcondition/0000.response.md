Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` have been updated by the function `func_1`.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. Since the exact values returned by `func_1()` are not specified, we know that `n` and `k` have been updated, but their specific values are not known. However, we maintain the conditions that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
