Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation array so that the element `x` is at position `l` when performing a binary search.
- Function `func_3()` is supposed to find the position of `x` in the permutation array and then perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l] = x` after the binary search.
- The current implementation of `func_3()` does not actually perform any swaps and instead just checks if `x` is in the array. If `x` is not found, it prints `1` and `low + 1, -1`, which does not help in rearranging the array.
- The problem statement specifies that the binary search should be modified by performing at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l]` is `x` after the search. The current implementation does not achieve this.
- Therefore, the function `func_3()` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
