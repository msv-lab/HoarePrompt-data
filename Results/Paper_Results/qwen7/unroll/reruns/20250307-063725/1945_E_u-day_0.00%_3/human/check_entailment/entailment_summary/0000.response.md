Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation array `p` such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing binary search.
- The solution provided uses a binary search approach but does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` after the binary search.
- Specifically, the function `func_3` does not perform any swaps to ensure that `x` is at the correct position; instead, it just prints the index of the smallest element greater than or equal to `x` if `x` is not found.
- The problem statement clearly states that the array should be rearranged using at most 2 swaps, but the provided function does not achieve this.
- Therefore, the given implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
