Postcondition: **The variable `pos` will be the index `i` where `arr[i] == k`, or -1 if no such index exists. The variable `st` will contain all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, which are calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The variables `low` and `high` will be adjusted based on the condition `if arr[mid] > k: high = mid; else: low = mid`, until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`. Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.**
