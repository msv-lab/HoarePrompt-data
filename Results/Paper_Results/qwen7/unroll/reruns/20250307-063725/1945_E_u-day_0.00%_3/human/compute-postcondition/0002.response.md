Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The variable `pos` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states.
