Postcondition: **The variable `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low] == k`, the variable `st` contains all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, which are calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The variable `low` is such that `arr[low] == k`, and `high` is adjusted accordingly so that `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.**
