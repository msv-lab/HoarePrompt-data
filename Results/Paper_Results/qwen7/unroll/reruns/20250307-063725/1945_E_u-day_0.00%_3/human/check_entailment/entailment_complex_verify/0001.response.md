### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**:
   - The task is to rearrange a permutation array to find a specific element `k` using at most 2 swaps before performing a binary search.
   - The provided code attempts to find the position of `k` and then perform a binary search-like operation, but it does not correctly implement the binary search logic.

2. **Code Review**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Converts the result of `func_1` into a list.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: Attempts to solve the problem.
     - It finds the position of `k` in the array.
     - It then performs a binary search-like operation, but the implementation is incorrect.
     - The set `st` is used to store midpoints, which is unnecessary and incorrect for a binary search.
     - The logic to update `low` and `high` is flawed, and the code does not correctly handle the conditions for the binary search.

3. **Flaws in the Code**:
   - The binary search-like operation is not implemented correctly. The set `st` is used to store midpoints, which is unnecessary and incorrect for a binary search.
   - The logic to determine the correct position using the binary search is flawed. The code does not correctly handle the conditions to update `low` and `high`.
   - The code does not actually perform the required swaps to rearrange the array before performing the binary search.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the position of `k` in the array.
   - We then need to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` when the binary search is performed.
   - The provided code does not correctly implement these steps.

5. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly identifies the state transitions and the intended logic, but the actual implementation is flawed.
   - The binary search-like operation is not correctly implemented, and the set `st` is unnecessary.
   - The code does not perform the required swaps to rearrange the array.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The binary search-like operation is flawed, and the code does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
