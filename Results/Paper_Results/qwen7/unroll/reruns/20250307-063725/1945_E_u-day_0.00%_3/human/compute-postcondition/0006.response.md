Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`, and `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists after all iterations.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively. These changes only affect the values of `low` and `high`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
