State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`, `i` is 0, and `pos` is -1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is defined in the loop head as `for i in range(n)`.
2. The loop will start with `i` being 0 and increment `i` until `i` is no longer less than `n`.
3. Since `i` starts at 0, it needs to be explicitly set to 0 before the loop begins.
4. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos`) are not directly involved in the loop's condition or incrementation, but they should remain consistent with their initial states as provided.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` being set to 0, while the other variables retain their initial values.
