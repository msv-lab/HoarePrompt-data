Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` will be the index `i` where `arr[i] == k`, or -1 if no such index exists.
- `st` will contain all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, which are calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `low` and `high` will be adjusted based on the condition `if arr[mid] > k: high = mid; else: low = mid`, until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`. This means it will print the integer `1` regardless of the values of `pos`, `st`, `low`, `high`, and `arr`.

Output: **1**
