Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The program attempts to find the position of `k` in the array and then performs a binary search-like operation. However, it does not actually rearrange the array to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` using at most 2 swaps. Instead, it tries to perform a binary search directly on the given permutation, which is not the correct approach according to the problem statement.

The correct approach involves rearranging the array with at most 2 swaps to make sure that `p_l` is equal to `x` before performing the binary search. The provided code does not include the logic to rearrange the array, hence it is incorrect.
