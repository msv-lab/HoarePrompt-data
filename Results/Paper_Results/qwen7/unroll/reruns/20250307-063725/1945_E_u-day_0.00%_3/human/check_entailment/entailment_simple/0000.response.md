Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation array with at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the position `l` when performing a binary search.
2. The annotated program does not actually implement the required logic for finding and swapping elements to achieve the desired outcome. Instead, it performs a binary search on the permutation array without any swaps.
3. The function `func_3()` does not correctly identify the position of `x` in the permutation array and does not perform any swaps to place `x` at the start of the array.
4. The binary search performed in `func_3()` does not guarantee that the element `x` will be at the start of the array after the search completes.
5. The annotated comments suggest that the program should output the number of swaps and the indices to be swapped, but the actual implementation does not perform these actions correctly.

Given the above points, the annotated program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
