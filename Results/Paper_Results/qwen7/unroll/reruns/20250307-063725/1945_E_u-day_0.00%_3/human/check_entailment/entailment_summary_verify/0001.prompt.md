You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function determines whether the integer `k` is present in the permutation array `arr`. If `k` is found in `arr`, it prints `0` and exits. If `k` is not found, it prints `1` followed by the smallest index greater than or equal to `k` and `-1`. The function returns an integer indicating whether `k` was found (`0`) or not found (`1`).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation array to find a specific element using at most 2 swaps before performing a binary search. The provided code attempts to find the position of the target element `k` in the array and then performs a binary search-like operation.

2. **Code Review**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function converts the result of `func_1` into a list.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is supposed to solve the problem.
     - It first finds the position of the target element `k` in the array.
     - It then attempts to perform a binary search-like operation to find the correct position.
     - However, the binary search-like operation is flawed because it uses a set to store midpoints and does not correctly implement the binary search logic.

3. **Flaws in the Code**:
   - The binary search-like operation is not implemented correctly. The set `st` is used to store midpoints, which is unnecessary and incorrect for a binary search.
   - The logic to determine the correct position using the binary search is flawed. The code does not correctly handle the conditions to update `low` and `high`.
   - The code does not actually perform the required swaps to rearrange the array before performing the binary search.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the position of `k` in the array.
   - We then need to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` when the binary search is performed.
   - The provided code does not correctly implement these steps.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
