Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`**.

This means that the variable `arr` has been assigned the return value of the function `func_2()`, while the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their updated values by the function `func_1`.
