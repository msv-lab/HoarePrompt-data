Output State: **The variable `pos` will be the index `i` where `arr[i] == k`, or -1 if no such index exists. The variable `st` will contain all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, which are calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. The variables `low` and `high` will be adjusted based on the condition `if arr[mid] > k: high = mid; else: low = mid`, until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.**

This means that after the loop finishes, `pos` will hold the index of `k` in the array `arr` if it exists, otherwise, it will be -1. The set `st` will contain all the midpoints calculated during the binary search process. The variables `low` and `high` will be the final bounds where `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`, effectively narrowing down the search range to a point where further division is not possible.
