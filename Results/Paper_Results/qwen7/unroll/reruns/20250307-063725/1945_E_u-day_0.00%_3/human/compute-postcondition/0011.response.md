Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is the index `low` where `arr[low] == k`.
- `st` contains all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, where `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `low` is such that `arr[low] == k`.
- `high` is adjusted so that `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
