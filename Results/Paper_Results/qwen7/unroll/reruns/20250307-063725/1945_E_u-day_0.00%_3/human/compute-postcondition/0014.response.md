Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is the index `i` where `arr[i] == k`, or -1 if no such index exists.
- `st` contains all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop iterations, which are calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
- `low` and `high` are adjusted based on the condition `if arr[mid] > k: high = mid; else: low = mid`, until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

When the loop terminates, `low + 1` will be the position right after the last valid midpoint check, and `pos` will either be the correct index where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index was found.

Given that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it means that the binary search did not find `k` in the array. Therefore, `pos` will be -1.

The value of `low + 1` will be the smallest index greater than any midpoint checked during the search, which effectively represents the insertion point for `k` in the sorted array `arr`.

Thus, the output will be:

Output: **low + 1, -1**
