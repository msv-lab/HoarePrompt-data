Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an integer.**

If `k` is within the valid range (1 to `n`), the function processes the permutation array `arr` and returns an integer based on some unspecified logic. If `k` is out of the valid range, the behavior is not specified in the given information.
