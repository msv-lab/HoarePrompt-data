Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`, `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists after all iterations, `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`low`, `high`, `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`). Therefore, the output state includes all the original conditions plus the new fact that `st` is now an empty set.
