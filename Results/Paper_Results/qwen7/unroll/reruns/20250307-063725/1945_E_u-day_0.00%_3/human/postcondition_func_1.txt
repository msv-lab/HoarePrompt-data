The function processes the variables t, n, x, and p, where t is an integer between 1 and 20000, n and x are integers between 1 and 200000, and p is a list of n integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n. It then calls another function, func_1(), with these variables as input and returns the list generated by func_1().
