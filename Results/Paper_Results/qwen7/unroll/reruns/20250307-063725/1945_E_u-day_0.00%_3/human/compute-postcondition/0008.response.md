Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while low + 1 < high:`. The variables involved here are `low` and `high`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `low + 1 < high`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array.
   - `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`.
   - `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists after all iterations.
   - `st` is an empty set.

4. **Check the current values of `low` and `high`**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.

5. **Evaluate the loop condition**:
   - The condition `low + 1 < high` translates to `0 + 1 < n - 1`, which simplifies to `1 < n - 1` or `n > 2`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 2. This ensures that `low + 1 < high` is true.
   - No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect that `n` must be greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`, `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists after all iterations, `st` is an empty set**.
