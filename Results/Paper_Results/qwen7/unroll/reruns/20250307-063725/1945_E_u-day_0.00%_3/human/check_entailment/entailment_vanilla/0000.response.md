### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation array to find a specific element using at most 2 swaps before performing a binary search. The provided code attempts to find the position of the target element `k` in the array and then performs a binary search-like operation.

2. **Code Review**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function converts the result of `func_1` into a list.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is supposed to solve the problem.
     - It first finds the position of the target element `k` in the array.
     - It then attempts to perform a binary search-like operation to find the correct position.
     - However, the binary search-like operation is flawed because it uses a set to store midpoints and does not correctly implement the binary search logic.

3. **Flaws in the Code**:
   - The binary search-like operation is not implemented correctly. The set `st` is used to store midpoints, which is unnecessary and incorrect for a binary search.
   - The logic to determine the correct position using the binary search is flawed. The code does not correctly handle the conditions to update `low` and `high`.
   - The code does not actually perform the required swaps to rearrange the array before performing the binary search.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find the position of `k` in the array.
   - We then need to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` when the binary search is performed.
   - The provided code does not correctly implement these steps.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
