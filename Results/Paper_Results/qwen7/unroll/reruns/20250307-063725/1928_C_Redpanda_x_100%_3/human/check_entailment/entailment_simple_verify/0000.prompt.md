You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:

            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Annotated Code: 
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 1
    h = n - x
    ans = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))
    ans2 = set()
    if x != 1:
        h = n + x - 2
        ans2 = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))
    ans = ans.union(ans2)
    print(len(ans))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, where n represents Vasya's position in the line. The function `generate(0)` is expected to yield prime factors, though it is not defined in the provided code snippet.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The variable `i` is 3, `factors` is a dictionary with key-value pairs indicating the prime factorization of `nn`, and `nn` is reduced to its product of prime factors each raised to their respective powers.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `i` is 3, `factors` is a dictionary with the key `nn` having a value of 1 (since the original value was 0 and we added 1), and `nn` is reduced to its product of prime factors each raised to their respective powers.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 3, `factors` is a dictionary with the key `nn` having a value of 1, and `primes` is a list containing the prime factors of `nn`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify any of the variables `i`, `factors`, or `primes`. It only contains a `yield` statement that generates factors but does not assign them to any variable outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `factors`, and `primes` remain unchanged after the loop executes.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `factor` has been iterated over all elements in `rest`, generating multiples of `factor * prime_to_i` up to `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is either equal to the length of the list `primes` or not, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `factor` has been iterated over all elements in `rest`, generating multiples of `factor * prime_to_i` up to `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, then 1 is yielded.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to address the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are related to generating factors and prime numbers, which are not relevant to the problem of determining the number of possible values of \( k \) given Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

The problem requires finding how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints, but the provided code does not contain any logic to solve this problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
