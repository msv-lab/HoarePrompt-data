### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya can fit into the settling pattern described.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code provided includes two functions `func_1` and `generate`, but neither function appears to be used in solving the problem as stated. The problem requires determining the number of possible \( k \) values, which should involve some form of mathematical analysis rather than generating factors or prime numbers.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that the settling pattern fits.
   - The key observation is that the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. Therefore, \( n \mod (2k - 2) \) must equal 0 for the pattern to fit.
   - Additionally, \( x \) must be within the range of the numbers assigned in one cycle of the pattern, which is from 1 to \( k \).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and check if both conditions are satisfied.
   - Specifically, we need to check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( x \) is within the range 1 to \( k \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - We can implement a simple loop to check for valid \( k \) values starting from 2 (since \( k = 1 \) is not allowed).
   - For each \( k \), we check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( 1 \leq x \leq k \).

6. **Code Evaluation:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it involves unnecessary factor generation and does not perform the required checks.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It generates factors and prime numbers, which are not relevant to determining the number of possible \( k \) values.
