You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and returns a sequence of integers. If `k` is equal to the length of the list `primes`, it yields 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates multiples of prime numbers up to `factors[prime] + 1` times for each factor in the sequence generated by the recursive call `generate(k + 1)`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya can fit into the settling pattern described.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code provided includes two functions `func_1` and `generate`, but neither function appears to be used in solving the problem as stated. The problem requires determining the number of possible \( k \) values, which should involve some form of mathematical analysis rather than generating factors or prime numbers.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that the settling pattern fits.
   - The key observation is that the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions. Therefore, \( n \mod (2k - 2) \) must equal 0 for the pattern to fit.
   - Additionally, \( x \) must be within the range of the numbers assigned in one cycle of the pattern, which is from 1 to \( k \).

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) and check if both conditions are satisfied.
   - Specifically, we need to check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( x \) is within the range 1 to \( k \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - We can implement a simple loop to check for valid \( k \) values starting from 2 (since \( k = 1 \) is not allowed).
   - For each \( k \), we check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( 1 \leq x \leq k \).

6. **Code Evaluation:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it involves unnecessary factor generation and does not perform the required checks.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It generates factors and prime numbers, which are not relevant to determining the number of possible \( k \) values.
