Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to address the problem description at all. The functions `func_1` and `generate` are related to generating factors and prime numbers, which are not relevant to the problem of determining the number of possible values of \( k \) given Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling.

The problem requires finding how many natural numbers \( k \) fit the given constraints, but the provided code does not contain any logic to solve this problem. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
