### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya can fit into the settling pattern described.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and within each cycle, the numbers assigned are from 1 to \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The provided code includes two functions `func_1` and `generate`, but neither function directly addresses the problem at hand. `func_1` generates factors of a number, and `generate` generates multiples of prime numbers, which are not relevant to solving the problem.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - To determine the number of possible \( k \) values, we need to check two conditions:
     1. \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) to ensure the position \( n \) fits into the repeating pattern.
     2. \( 1 \leq x \leq k \) to ensure the number \( x \) is within the range of the current cycle.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 (since \( k = 1 \) is not allowed) and check if both conditions are satisfied.
   - Specifically, for each \( k \), we check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( 1 \leq x \leq k \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - We can implement a simple loop to check for valid \( k \) values.
   - For each \( k \), we check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( 1 \leq x \leq k \).

6. **Code Evaluation:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not perform the necessary checks to determine the number of possible \( k \) values.

### Correct Implementation:
```python
def count_possible_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    k = 2
    while True:
        if (n % (2 * k - 2) == 0) and (1 <= x <= k):
            count += 1
        k += 1
        if (2 * k - 2) > n:
            break
    return count
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it involves unnecessary factor generation and does not perform the required checks.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
