Functionality: **The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and returns a sequence of integers. If `k` is equal to the length of the list `primes`, it yields 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates multiples of prime numbers up to `factors[prime] + 1` times for each factor in the sequence generated by the recursive call `generate(k + 1)`.**
