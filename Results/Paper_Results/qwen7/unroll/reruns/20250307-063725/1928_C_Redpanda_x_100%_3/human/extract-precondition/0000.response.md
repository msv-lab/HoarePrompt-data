Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.** 

Note: The provided function `generate` does not seem to be related to the problem description or the variables in the main function that processes the test cases. It appears to be a separate function dealing with prime factors, which is not relevant to solving the given problem about Vasya's position and number during the settling process.
