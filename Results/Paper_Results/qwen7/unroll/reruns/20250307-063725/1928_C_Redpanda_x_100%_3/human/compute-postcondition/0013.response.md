The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The function does not define its own logic but is expected to return prime factors generated by the function `generate(0)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return the prime factors generated by the function `generate(0)`.
