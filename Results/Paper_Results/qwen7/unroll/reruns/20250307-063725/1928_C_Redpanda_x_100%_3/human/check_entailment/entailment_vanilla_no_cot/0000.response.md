Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not address the logic needed to determine the number of possible values for `k` based on Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to determine how many values of `k` can satisfy the given conditions. The key observation is that the sequence repeats every `2k-2` positions. Given `n` and `x`, we can derive the possible values of `k` by checking the conditions within one period of the sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_possible_k(n, x):
    # Calculate the remainder when n is divided by 2k-2
    remainder = n % (2 * x - 2)
    
    # If remainder is less than x, there are x possible values of k
    if remainder < x:
        return x
    # Otherwise, there are x-1 possible values of k
    else:
        return x - 1

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_possible_k(n, x))
```

This function directly calculates the number of possible values for `k` based on the given position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received. It does not require complex factorization or generating functions.
