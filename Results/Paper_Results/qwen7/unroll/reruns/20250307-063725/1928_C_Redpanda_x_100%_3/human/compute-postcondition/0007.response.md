Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `factor` has gone through all values in the list `rest`. For each `factor` in `rest`, the variable `prime_to_i` was updated in the inner loop, and the generator yielded multiple values based on the value of `factors[prime] + 1`. The exact values yielded depend on the specific values of `factor`, `prime`, and `factors[prime]`.
