### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the settling pattern fits the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing segments of length \( k \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly identifies the constraints and the nature of the settling pattern.
   - It calculates the possible values of \( k \) using the function `func_1`, which should generate prime factors.
   - The logic checks if the generated \( k \) values satisfy the conditions \( k \mod 2 = 0 \) and \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \geq x \).

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to generate prime factors of a given number `n`.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is incomplete and relies on an undefined `generate` function, which should yield prime factors.
   - The current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly generate prime factors but instead yields the same value repeatedly.

4. **Function `generate`:**
   - The `generate` function is intended to generate all divisors of a number based on its prime factorization.
   - The implementation is flawed because it does not correctly handle the generation of divisors from the prime factorization.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly calculates the possible values of \( k \) by considering both \( n - x \) and \( n + x - 2 \).
   - It uses sets to avoid duplicate values and union them to get the final set of possible \( k \) values.
   - The length of the resulting set is printed as the number of valid \( k \) values.

### Conclusion:

Given the incomplete and flawed implementation of the `func_1` and `generate` functions, the provided code will not produce the correct results. The logic for determining the valid \( k \) values is sound, but the functions used to generate the necessary data are incorrect.

### Correctness:

**False**

The provided code is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` and `generate` functions.
