Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, and k is equal to the length of the list primes, and 1 is yielded.**

The code `yield 1` does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, or `k`. Instead, it yields the value `1`. Since the `yield` keyword is used in a generator context, the yielded value is returned when iterating over the generator. However, since no iteration is mentioned in the given context, the yielded value is simply part of the output state. All other variables retain their initial states.
