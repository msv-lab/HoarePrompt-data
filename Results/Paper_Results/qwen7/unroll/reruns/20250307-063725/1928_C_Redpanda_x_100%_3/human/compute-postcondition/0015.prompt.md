You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, where n represents Vasya's position in the line. The function `generate(0)` is expected to yield prime factors, though it is not defined in the provided code snippet.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The variable `i` is 3, `factors` is a dictionary with key-value pairs indicating the prime factorization of `nn`, and `nn` is reduced to its product of prime factors each raised to their respective powers.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: `i` is 3, `factors` is a dictionary with the key `nn` having a value of 1 (since the original value was 0 and we added 1), and `nn` is reduced to its product of prime factors each raised to their respective powers.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: `i` is 3, `factors` is a dictionary with the key `nn` having a value of 1, and `primes` is a list containing the prime factors of `nn`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify any of the variables `i`, `factors`, or `primes`. It only contains a `yield` statement that generates factors but does not assign them to any variable outside the loop. Therefore, the values of `i`, `factors`, and `primes` remain unchanged after the loop executes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^9, and returns the prime factors of `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
