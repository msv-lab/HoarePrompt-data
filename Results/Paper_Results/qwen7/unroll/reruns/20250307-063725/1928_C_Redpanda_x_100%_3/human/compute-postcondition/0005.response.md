Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `factor` and the object `rest`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `factor`**: The variable `factor` is being iterated over the elements of the list `rest`. Before the loop starts, `factor` has not yet been assigned any value from `rest`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `rest`**: The state of `rest` is given as `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`. This means `rest` is a list generated by the function `generate(k + 1)`.

4. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `rest`. Therefore, `rest` must not be an empty list.

5. **Adjust the States**: Since `factor` is not yet assigned any value from `rest` at the start of the loop, we don't need to adjust its initial state. However, we need to ensure that `rest` is not an empty list.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `rest` must not be an empty list.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is a non-empty list resulting from `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, `factor` is not yet assigned any value from `rest`**.

However, since the question specifically asks to focus on the states of objects in the loop head (which are `factor` and `rest`), the simplified answer is:

**State: `rest` is a non-empty list resulting from `generate(k + 1)`**.
