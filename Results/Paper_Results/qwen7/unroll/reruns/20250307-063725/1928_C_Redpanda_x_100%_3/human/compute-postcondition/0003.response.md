Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`**

Explanation: The code `rest = generate(k + 1)` assigns the result of calling the function `generate(k + 1)` to the variable `rest`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `primes` remain unchanged from their initial state.
