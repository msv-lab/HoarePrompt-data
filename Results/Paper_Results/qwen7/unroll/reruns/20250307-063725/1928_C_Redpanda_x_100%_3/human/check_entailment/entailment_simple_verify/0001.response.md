### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya can fit into the settling pattern described.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code provided includes two functions `func_1` and `generate`, but neither function appears to be used in solving the problem as stated. The problem requires determining the number of possible \( k \) values, which should involve some form of mathematical analysis rather than generating factors or prime numbers.
   - The code instead uses these functions to generate factors and prime numbers, which are not directly relevant to the problem.

3. **Mathematical Analysis:**
   - For a given position \( n \) and number \( x \), we need to check if there exists a \( k \) such that the given conditions are met:
     - \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \)
     - \( 1 \leq x \leq k \)

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate over possible values of \( k \) starting from 2 (since \( k = 1 \) is not allowed).
   - For each \( k \), we check if \( n \mod (2k - 2) = 0 \) and if \( 1 \leq x \leq k \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It generates factors and prime numbers, which are not relevant to determining the number of possible \( k \) values. Instead, it should directly check the conditions mentioned above.

6. **Code Evaluation:**
   - The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as it involves unnecessary factor generation and does not perform the required checks.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It generates factors and prime numbers, which are not relevant to determining the number of possible \( k \) values.

**Correctness: False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
