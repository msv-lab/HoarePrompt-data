Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the element at index `k` in the list `primes`, the loop has executed all its iterations, and `factor` has been iterated over all elements in `rest`, generating multiples of `factor * prime_to_i` up to `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.
