Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `tickets_bought < k`.

2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `total_cost` is 0.
   - `pq` is a heap.
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days.
   - `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day.
   - `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.
   - `tickets_bought` is 0.
   - `price_increase` is 0.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `tickets_bought < k` must be true.

4. **Current state of `tickets_bought`**: `tickets_bought` is currently 0.

5. **Adjust the state**: To satisfy the condition `tickets_bought < k`, `tickets_bought` must be less than `k`. Since `tickets_bought` is currently 0, it is already less than `k` as long as `k` is a positive integer (which it is, as stated in the problem).

6. **Conclusion**: No adjustments are necessary for `tickets_bought` because it is already 0, which satisfies the condition `tickets_bought < k`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0**.
