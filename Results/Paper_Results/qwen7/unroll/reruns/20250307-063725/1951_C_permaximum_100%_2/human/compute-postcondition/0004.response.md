Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, `tickets_bought` is 0, `price_increase` is 0.**

The code initializes `price_increase` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new value of `price_increase`.
