The function accepts four parameters: the number of sale days (`n`), the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day (`m`), the number of tickets to be bought at the end (`k`), and a list of ticket prices for each day (`prices`). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets over the sale days, with the price increasing each day based on the number of tickets bought.
