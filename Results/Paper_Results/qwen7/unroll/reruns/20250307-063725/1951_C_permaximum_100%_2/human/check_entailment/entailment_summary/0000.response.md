Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it should be considered correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with tuples containing the ticket prices and their respective days. This allows us to always consider the cheapest available ticket first.

2. **Heap Operations**: The program uses a heap to efficiently get the lowest price ticket each iteration. This ensures that we are always considering the best possible option to minimize the total cost.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: For each iteration, the program calculates how many tickets can be bought on the current day without exceeding the daily limit `m`. The cost is then updated by adding the price increase due to previous purchases.

4. **Cost Calculation**: The total cost is accumulated by multiplying the price of the tickets by the number of tickets bought each day.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the number of available days or the daily limit.

Given these points, the program should correctly compute the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
