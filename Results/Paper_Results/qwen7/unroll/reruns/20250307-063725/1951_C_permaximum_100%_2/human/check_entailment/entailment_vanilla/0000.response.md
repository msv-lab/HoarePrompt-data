### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
   - Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets, and buying `x` tickets on a day increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by `x`.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`, followed by the list of ticket prices for each day.
   - It then calls a function `func_1` to calculate the minimum cost.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples of `(price, day)` for each day's price.
   - Uses a heap to efficiently get the day with the lowest current price.
   - While the total number of tickets bought is less than `k`:
     - Pops the day with the lowest current price.
     - Increases the price for subsequent days by the number of tickets bought on the current day.
     - Buys the maximum possible tickets on the current day without exceeding `k`.
     - Updates the total cost and the price increase.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the constraints and logic correctly.
   - It uses a priority queue to always consider the cheapest option first, ensuring the minimum cost is achieved.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly implements the problem's requirements.
   - The use of a priority queue ensures that the algorithm efficiently finds the minimum cost.
   - The logic for increasing prices and buying tickets is consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
