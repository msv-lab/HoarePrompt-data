Output State: **The total_cost is the sum of the cost of buying `k` tickets over the sale days, with the price increasing each day based on the number of tickets bought. The tickets_bought equals `k`, and the price_increase reflects the cumulative increase in price due to the number of tickets bought each day.**

To break it down:
- `total_cost` will be the accumulated cost of buying `k` tickets, considering the price increase for each purchase.
- `tickets_bought` will be exactly `k` after the loop finishes.
- `price_increase` will be the total increase in price from the start of the loop to the end, based on the number of tickets bought each day.
