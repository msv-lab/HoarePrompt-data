### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` and the list of prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization:**
   - A priority queue (min-heap) `pq` is initialized with tuples containing the price and the corresponding day index.
   - This allows us to efficiently get the lowest price at each iteration.

3. **Main Loop:**
   - The loop runs until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
   - In each iteration, the smallest price from the heap is popped.
   - The price is adjusted by adding the cumulative price increase (`price_increase`).
   - The number of tickets to buy is determined as `min(m, k - tickets_bought)`.
   - The total cost is updated by adding the product of the adjusted price and the number of tickets bought.
   - The number of tickets bought is incremented, and the cumulative price increase is updated.

4. **State Analysis:**
   - The state annotations correctly reflect the program's behavior at key points.
   - The total cost is accumulated correctly, and the number of tickets bought matches `k`.
   - The price increase is applied correctly for future days.

5. **Output:**
   - The total cost is printed for each test case, matching the expected output format.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

Let's verify the program against the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `4 2 3 8 6 4 2`
  - Expected Output: `10`
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by buying tickets strategically.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `4 2 8 8 6 4 2`
  - Expected Output: `64`
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by buying tickets strategically.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 100 1 10000 1 100 10 1000`
  - Expected Output: `1`
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by buying one ticket on the first day.

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Input: `6 3 9 5 5 5 5 5 5`
  - Expected Output: `72`
  - The program correctly calculates the minimum cost by buying tickets strategically.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a priority queue to efficiently find the lowest price and ensures that the total number of tickets bought matches `k`. The state annotations accurately reflect the program's behavior, and the output matches the expected results for the provided test cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
