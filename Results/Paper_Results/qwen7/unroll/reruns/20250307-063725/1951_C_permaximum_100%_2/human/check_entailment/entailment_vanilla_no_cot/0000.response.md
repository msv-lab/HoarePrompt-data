Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending required to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints. The function `func_1` uses a priority queue (min-heap) to always consider the cheapest available ticket price first, taking into account the price increases after purchasing tickets on a particular day. The program processes each test case as specified and prints the minimum cost for each.
