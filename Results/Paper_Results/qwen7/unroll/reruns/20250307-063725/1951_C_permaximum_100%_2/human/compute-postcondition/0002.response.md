Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a heap, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.**

The code initializes the variable `total_cost` to 0. The other variables (`pq`, `n`, `m`, and `k`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `total_cost` and retains the initial states of the other variables.
