Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraints given.
2. The function initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the price and index of each day's ticket price. This ensures that the lowest price is always processed first.
3. It uses a while loop to keep buying tickets until the total number of tickets bought (`tickets_bought`) reaches `k`.
4. For each iteration, it pops the smallest price from the priority queue, increments the price by the `price_increase`, calculates the number of tickets to buy (`tickets_to_buy`), and updates the total cost accordingly.
5. The `price_increase` is updated by adding the number of tickets bought each day, ensuring that the price increases correctly as per the problem statement.
6. The function returns the `total_cost` once `k` tickets are bought.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
