Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of purchasing `k` tickets over `n` days with the constraints provided.
2. The function initializes a priority queue (min-heap) with the prices and their corresponding indices.
3. It iteratively pops the smallest price from the heap, adjusts it based on the cumulative increase, and buys the maximum possible tickets without exceeding `k`.
4. The price increase is updated accordingly after each purchase.
5. The loop continues until `k` tickets are bought.
6. The provided example and the logic within the function align with the problem statement and examples given.

Given the explanation and the logical flow of the code, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
