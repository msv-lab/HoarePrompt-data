Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.**

Explanation: The code creates a list of tuples named `pq`. Each tuple in the list contains a price from the `prices` list and the index of that price in the `prices` list. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
