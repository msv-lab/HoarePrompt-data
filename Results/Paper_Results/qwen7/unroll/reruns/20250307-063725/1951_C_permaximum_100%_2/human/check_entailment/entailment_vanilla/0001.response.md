Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the input correctly and processes each test case as specified.
2. It initializes a priority queue (min-heap) to store the prices and their corresponding days.
3. The `func_1` function iteratively pops the smallest price from the heap, calculates the adjusted price considering any previous price increases, and buys the maximum possible number of tickets without exceeding `k`.
4. The price increase is applied to future days as required by the problem statement.
5. The function correctly accumulates the total cost and ensures that the total number of tickets bought equals `k`.
6. The output format matches the expected output, printing the total cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
