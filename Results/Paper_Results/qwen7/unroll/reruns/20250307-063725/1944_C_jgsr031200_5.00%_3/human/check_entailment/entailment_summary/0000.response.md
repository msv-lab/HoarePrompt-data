Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the game's final score based on the optimal strategies of Alice and Bob.
2. The provided code does not accurately implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described.
3. The function `func_1` attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the array by iterating through the numbers and decrementing their counts using a counter. However, this approach does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob and does not ensure that the game is played optimally according to the rules.
4. The execution summary mentions that the function prints the final value of `start` or the successor of `start` if applicable, but this does not align with the expected behavior of the game as described in the problem statement.
5. The problem requires simulating the game where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements, and the final score is determined by the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
