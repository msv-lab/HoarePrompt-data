### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX (Minimum Excludant) of the resulting array `c`. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`.
   - Bob can only pick elements from `a` without appending them to `c`.
   - The goal is to determine the final MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) which are not relevant to solving the problem.
   - The `func_1` function is the core logic that processes the array `arr` and determines the final MEX.

4. **Core Logic in `func_1`**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` counts the occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - `start = 0` initializes the starting point for finding the MEX.
   - A loop iterates through the numbers in `arr` to ensure that all numbers up to `start` are included in the `vis` set.
   - If `start + 1` is available in `nums`, it increments `start` and continues.
   - If `start + 1` is not available, it prints `start + 1` as the MEX.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the smallest missing integer in the sequence of numbers from `0` to `n-1` that are present in `arr`.
   - This approach ensures that both players play optimally, as Alice will always try to include the smallest missing integer, and Bob will remove elements without affecting the MEX calculation directly.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where the smallest missing integer is found and printed correctly.
   - It also handles the scenario where no missing integer is found within the range, which should not happen given the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the optimal MEX for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
