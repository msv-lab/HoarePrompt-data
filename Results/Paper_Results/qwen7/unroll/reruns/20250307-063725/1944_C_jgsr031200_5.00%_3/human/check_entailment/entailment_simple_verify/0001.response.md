### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, respectively.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob picks elements from `a` and removes them directly.
   - The goal is to determine the optimal strategy for both players and compute the final MEX of `c`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The game alternates between Alice and Bob, and the process continues until `a` is empty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should always pick the smallest number from `a` that is not already in `c`.
   - Bob should pick the smallest number from `a` that is not already in `c`.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not relevant to the problem.
   - The function `func_1` is the only active part of the code, which attempts to solve the problem using a counter and a set to track visited numbers.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` counts the frequency of each number in the array.
   - `start = 0` initializes the starting point for finding the smallest missing number.
   - `vis` is a set used to track visited numbers.
   - The while loop iterates until `start` is no longer present in `nums`:
     - If `start` is in `nums`, it is added to `vis` and its count is decremented.
     - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it is processed similarly.
     - If neither `start` nor `start + 1` are in `nums`, the smallest missing number is printed.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The current implementation does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` attempts to find the smallest missing number by iterating through the numbers and decrementing their counts in the counter.
   - However, this approach does not simulate the game correctly. Alice and Bob should take turns picking the smallest available number, not just iterate through the numbers.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game described. It does not simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
