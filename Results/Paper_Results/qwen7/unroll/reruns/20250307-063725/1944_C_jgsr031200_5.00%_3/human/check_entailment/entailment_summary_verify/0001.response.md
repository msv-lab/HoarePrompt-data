### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c`, and removing it from `a`.
   - Bob then picks an element from `a` and removes it.
   - The game continues until `a` is empty.
   - The final score is the MEX of the array `c`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`), which are irrelevant to the problem.
   - The active function `func_1` uses a counter to track the frequency of each number in the array and iterates through the array to find the smallest missing number.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` counts the frequency of each number in the array.
   - `start = 0` initializes the starting point for finding the smallest missing number.
   - `vis` is a set used to track visited numbers.
   - The while loop iterates until `start` is no longer present in `nums`:
     - If `start` is in `nums`, it is added to `vis` and its count is decremented.
     - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it is processed similarly.
     - If neither `start` nor `start + 1` are in `nums`, the smallest missing number is printed.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The current implementation does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly.

7. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly simulate the game, we need to ensure that Alice and Bob take turns picking the smallest available number.
   - We can use a priority queue (or sorted list) to keep track of the smallest available numbers and alternate turns between Alice and Bob.

8. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game. It only checks for the smallest missing number without considering the turns taken by Alice and Bob.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game described. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
