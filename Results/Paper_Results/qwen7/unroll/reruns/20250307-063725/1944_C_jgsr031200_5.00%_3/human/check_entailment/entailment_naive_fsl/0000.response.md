Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. The function `func_1` attempts to find the smallest missing integer in a sequence of counts, but it does not accurately model the turns of Alice and Bob or the process of building the array `c`.

Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that Alice always appends an element to `c` and removes it from `a`, while Bob only removes elements from `a`. Additionally, the logic for determining the MEX of `c` is not correctly implemented. The program seems to be trying to find the smallest integer that is not present in the counts, which is not equivalent to finding the MEX of the elements appended to `c`.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to simulate the turns of Alice and Bob and construct the array `c` accordingly. The current implementation does not handle the turns correctly and does not build the array `c` as required by the game rules.
