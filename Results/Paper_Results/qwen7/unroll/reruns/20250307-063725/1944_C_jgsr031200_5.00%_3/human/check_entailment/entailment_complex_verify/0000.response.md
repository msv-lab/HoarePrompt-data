### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly simulates the game between Alice and Bob and computes the MEX of the array `c` as required.

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice starts by picking an element from `a`, appending it to `c`, and removing it from `a`.
   - Bob then picks an element from `a` and removes it from `a`.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.
   - The MEX of `c` is computed at the end of the game.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1` which is supposed to compute the MEX of `c`.
   - The function uses a `Counter` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - It then iterates through the elements, decrementing the count of the current element and its successor if it exists.
   - If it encounters an element whose count is zero and its successor also has a count of zero, it prints the successor and returns.
   - Otherwise, it continues until it reaches the end of the list, printing the final value of `start`.

3. **Key Issues:**
   - The function `func_1` does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob correctly.
   - It does not append elements to `c` as Alice does.
   - It does not remove elements from `a` as Bob does.
   - The logic for determining the MEX is not correctly implemented.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - Alice should append elements to `c` and remove them from `a`.
   - Bob should only remove elements from `a`.
   - The MEX of `c` should be computed at the end of the game.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly simulate the game and compute the MEX of `c`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
