Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\), and \(n\) is the length of the list. It uses a counter to track the occurrences of each integer in the list. The function then iterates through the list, decrementing the count of the current element and its successor if it exists. If it encounters an element whose count is zero and its successor also has a count of zero, it prints the successor and returns. Otherwise, it continues until it reaches the end of the list, printing the final value of `start`. The function does not return any value but prints the final value of `start` or the successor of `start` if applicable.**
