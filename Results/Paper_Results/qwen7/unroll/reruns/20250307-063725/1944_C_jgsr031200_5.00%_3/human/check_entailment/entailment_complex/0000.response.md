Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after both Alice and Bob have played optimally. However, the provided code does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described.
2. The function `func_1` does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Instead, it seems to be trying to find the smallest missing number in the array `arr` by iterating through it and decrementing counts of elements.
3. The logic inside `func_1` does not reflect the game rules where Alice can pick any element from `arr` and append it to `c`, and Bob can only pick an element from `arr` and remove it without appending it to `c`.
4. The provided code does not handle the alternating turns of Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and thus cannot produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
