### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX of the resulting array `c`, respectively. Alice starts by appending elements to `c` and deleting them from `a`, while Bob directly deletes elements from `a`.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob's goal is to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number to ensure the highest possible MEX.
   - Bob should pick the smallest available number to ensure the lowest possible MEX.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) that are not relevant to the problem.
   - The function `func_1` is the only active part of the code, which attempts to solve the problem using a counter and a set to track visited numbers.

5. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` counts the frequency of each number in the array.
   - `start = 0` initializes the starting point for finding the smallest missing number.
   - `vis` is a set used to track visited numbers.
   - The while loop iterates until `start` is no longer present in `nums`:
     - If `start` is in `nums`, it is added to `vis` and its count is decremented.
     - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it is processed similarly.
     - If neither `start` nor `start + 1` are in `nums`, the smallest missing number is printed.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns.
   - Alice should always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob should pick the smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
   - The current implementation does not handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob properly. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that Alice and Bob take turns, and it does not ensure that Alice always picks first.

7. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game. It processes the array in a linear fashion without considering the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - The function does not ensure that Alice always picks first and that Bob picks next, which is crucial for determining the optimal strategy.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for the game described. It fails to simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and does not ensure that Alice always picks first.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and does not ensure that Alice always picks first.
