Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Here’s why:

1. **Game Logic Mismatch**: The game involves two different types of moves by Alice and Bob, and the current implementation does not account for these differences. Specifically:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it, without appending to `c`.

2. **Incorrect Strategy**: The current function `func_1` does not simulate the optimal play for both Alice and Bob. Instead, it seems to be trying to find the first missing number in a sequence, which does not align with the game rules.

3. **Missing Core Logic**: There is no logic to handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob, nor is there any mechanism to ensure that both players play optimally according to their respective strategies.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game with the following steps:
- Use a counter to keep track of the elements in `a`.
- Simulate the turns for Alice and Bob optimally.
- Ensure that Alice maximizes the MEX and Bob minimizes it.

Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def find_game_score(n, arr):
    # Count the frequency of each element in the array
    freq = Counter(arr)
    
    # Initialize variables to keep track of the optimal game state
    mex = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    while freq:
        # Alice's turn: Pick the smallest available element
        while freq[mex] == 0:
            mex += 1
        
        # Remove the chosen element from the frequency counter
        freq[mex] -= 1
        
        # If the element was the last occurrence, remove it completely
        if freq[mex] == 0:
            del freq[mex]
        
        # Bob's turn: Remove the smallest available element
        while freq[mex] == 0:
            mex += 1
        
        # Remove the chosen element from the frequency counter
        freq[mex] -= 1
        
        # If the element was the last occurrence, remove it completely
        if freq[mex] == 0:
            del freq[mex]
    
    return mex

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(find_game_score(n, arr))
```

This code correctly simulates the game with Alice and Bob taking turns optimally, ensuring that the final MEX is calculated accurately.
