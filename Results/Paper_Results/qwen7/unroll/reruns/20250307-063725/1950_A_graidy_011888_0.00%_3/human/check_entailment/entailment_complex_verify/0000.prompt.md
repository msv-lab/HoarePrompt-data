You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''

            elif y < z:

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements: three integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) representing `x`, `y`, and `z`, and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') representing the result of the conditional checks.
    #
    #Each line will be formatted as follows:
    #- The first integer (`x`) will be compared with the second integer (`y`).
    #- If `x` is less than `y`, then `y` will be compared with `z`.
    #  - If `y` is greater than `z`, the result will be 'peak'.
    #  - If `y` is less than `z`, the result will be 'stair'.
    #  - If `y` equals `z`, the result will be 'none'.
    #- If `x` is not less than `y`, the result will always be 'none'.
    #
    #The loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = 1000`, generating new random values for `x`, `y`, and `z` on each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the result is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the result is 'stair'; otherwise, the result is 'none'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair or a peak. The program generates random digits and prints them along with a result, but this does not address the actual problem description. Specifically, the logic inside the `func` function does not correctly identify whether the digits form a stair or a peak based on the given conditions.

For example, consider the input `1 5 3`. According to the problem description, this should be classified as a "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly classify this as "none" because it does not properly handle the comparison logic.

To fix this, the program should compare the digits according to the definitions of a stair and a peak directly, rather than generating random values. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print("STAIR")
        elif a < b > c:
            print("PEAK")
        else:
            print("NONE")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version reads the input values and correctly classifies them based on the given conditions.
