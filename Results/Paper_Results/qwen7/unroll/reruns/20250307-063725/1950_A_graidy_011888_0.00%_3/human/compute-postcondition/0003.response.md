Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements: three integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) representing `x`, `y`, and `z`, and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') representing the result of the conditional checks.

Each line will be formatted as follows:
- The first integer (`x`) will be compared with the second integer (`y`).
- If `x` is less than `y`, then `y` will be compared with `z`.
  - If `y` is greater than `z`, the result will be 'peak'.
  - If `y` is less than `z`, the result will be 'stair'.
  - If `y` equals `z`, the result will be 'none'.
- If `x` is not less than `y`, the result will always be 'none'.

The loop will iterate from `i = 1` to `i = 1000`, generating new random values for `x`, `y`, and `z` on each iteration.
