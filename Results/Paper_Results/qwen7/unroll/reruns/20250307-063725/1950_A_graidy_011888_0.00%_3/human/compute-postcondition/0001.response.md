State: **`i` is 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `i <= 1000`.
2. Right before the loop, `i` is 1.
3. For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= 1000` must be true.
4. Since `i` is already 1, it satisfies the condition `i <= 1000`.

No adjustments are necessary because the condition is already met.
