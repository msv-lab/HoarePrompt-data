You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the result is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the result is 'stair'; otherwise, the result is 'none'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the digits form a stair or a peak. The program generates random digits and prints them along with a result, but this does not address the actual problem description. Specifically, the logic inside the `func` function does not correctly identify whether the digits form a stair or a peak based on the given conditions.

For example, consider the input `1 5 3`. According to the problem description, this should be classified as a "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`. However, the current implementation would incorrectly classify this as "none" because it does not properly handle the comparison logic.

To fix this, the program should compare the digits according to the definitions of a stair and a peak directly, rather than generating random values. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print("STAIR")
        elif a < b > c:
            print("PEAK")
        else:
            print("NONE")

# Example usage:
# func()
```

This corrected version reads the input values and correctly classifies them based on the given conditions.
