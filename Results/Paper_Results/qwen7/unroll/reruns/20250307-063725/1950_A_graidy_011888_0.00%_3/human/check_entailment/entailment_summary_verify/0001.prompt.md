You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the result is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the result is 'stair'; otherwise, the result is 'none'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description vs. Provided Program**:
   - The problem requires determining whether three given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither based on specific conditions.
   - The provided program uses `randint` to generate random numbers for `x`, `y`, and `z` instead of reading input from the user.

2. **Random Number Generation**:
   - The program generates 1000 sets of random numbers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and prints them out along with their classification.
   - This does not match the problem's requirement of processing a specified number of test cases (up to 1000) where the test cases are provided as input.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The problem specifies that the first line contains an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines of three digits each.
   - The provided program does not read any input from the user; it generates random numbers internally.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The problem requires printing "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case.
   - The provided program prints the generated numbers and their classification, which does not follow the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. It generates random numbers and prints them without reading any input from the user, and it does not produce the correct output format.

### Correctness:
**False**

Correctness: False
