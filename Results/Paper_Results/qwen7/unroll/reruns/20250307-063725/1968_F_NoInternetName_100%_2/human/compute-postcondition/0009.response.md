Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' and 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` in the range `q`, the program checks three conditions:
1. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next iteration.
2. Otherwise, it finds the lower bound (`lower`) and upper bound (`upper`) of indices in `inds` for the values `x[r]` and `x[l - 1]` respectively, considering certain conditions.
3. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The `inds` dictionary will remain unchanged as it is initialized before the loop and not modified within the loop. The `x` list will also remain unchanged because the loop does not modify it; it only reads from it.
