Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions, but this approach is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Prefixes**: The program tries to use binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions. However, the logic for determining these indices is incorrect. The binary search functions `func_3` and `func_4` are not used appropriately to solve the problem.

2. **Misuse of Binary Search**: The binary search functions are not correctly utilized to find the appropriate indices for the XOR values. The logic inside `func_3` and `func_4` does not accurately reflect the necessary operations to determine if a subarray is interesting.

3. **Logic Flaws in XOR Matching**: The program checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` to determine if the subarray is interesting, which is not sufficient. It also incorrectly uses binary search to find matching indices without properly accounting for the conditions required for the subarray to be interesting.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Given the array `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and the query `(1, 5)`:

- The prefix XOR values are: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 2]`.
- The subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` has a prefix XOR value of `2` at index `4`.

However, the program would incorrectly handle this case because it does not properly account for the conditions required to split the array into multiple parts with equal XOR values.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
