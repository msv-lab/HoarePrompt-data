Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, and the function `func_1(int)` has been called to assign values to `n` and `q`.**

The code snippet `n, q = func_1(int)` calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument (though the exact integer is not specified) and assigns the returned values to `n` and `q`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact values of `n` and `q` from this line alone, but we know they are within the specified ranges. The other variables (`a`, `l`, and `r`) remain unchanged.
