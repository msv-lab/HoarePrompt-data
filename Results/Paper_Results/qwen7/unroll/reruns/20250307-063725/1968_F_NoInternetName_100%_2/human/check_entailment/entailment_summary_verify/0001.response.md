### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a subarray can be divided into `k` parts such that the bitwise XOR of each part is equal. The solution uses a prefix XOR array to efficiently check this condition.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Prefix XOR Array**: This array helps in quickly calculating the XOR of any subarray.
   - **Query Handling**: For each query, the solution checks if the XOR of the entire subarray is zero (since if the XOR is zero, it can always be divided into multiple parts with the same XOR value). If not, it checks if there exists a point within the subarray where the XOR values match the required conditions.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function reads and maps input data. It is used correctly to read integers and split them.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This is a binary search function that finds the first index satisfying a predicate. However, it is not used in the main logic, which is a potential redundancy.
   - **Function 3 (`func_3`)**: This function is essentially a wrapper around `func_2`, which is redundant.
   - **Function 4 (`func_4`)**: This function is another wrapper around `func_2`, also redundant.
   - **Function 5 (`func_5`)**: This function handles the main logic.
     - **Initialization**: Reads `n` and `q`, and constructs the prefix XOR array.
     - **Query Processing**: For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero.
     - **Binary Search Usage**: Uses binary search to find indices where the XOR matches the required conditions.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The logic for constructing the prefix XOR array and checking subarray XORs is correct.
   - The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are not necessary and can be simplified.
   - The main logic correctly identifies if a subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.

However, the original assessment did not fully address the following points:
- The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are indeed redundant and do not contribute to the correctness of the program.
- The function summaries provided do not accurately reflect the actual usage of these functions in the main logic.

### Conclusion:
While the core logic of the program is correct, the presence of redundant functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) makes the code unnecessarily complex and less efficient. The function summaries provided do not fully capture the actual usage of these functions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is correct in terms of functionality, but the presence of redundant functions makes it less optimal and the function summaries do not accurately describe the usage of these functions.
