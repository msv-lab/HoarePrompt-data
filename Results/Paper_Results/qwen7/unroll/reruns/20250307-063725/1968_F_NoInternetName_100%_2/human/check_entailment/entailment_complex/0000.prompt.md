Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_5()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a callable function that can convert string inputs to appropriate types (e.g., int, float), and the input is a space-separated string of integers or other types that can be converted by cast.
def func_1(cast):
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the callable function `cast` to each element of the input string after splitting it by spaces. The input string should contain space-separated values that can be converted by the `cast` function.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a callable function `cast` and a space-separated string of values. It splits the string into individual elements, then applies the `cast` function to each element, converting them to their appropriate types. The function returns a map object containing these converted values.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
def func_2(arr, predicate):
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: l is the index of the first element that satisfies the predicate, or l is equal to the length of arr if no such element exists.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the index of the first element that satisfies the predicate, or the length of `arr` if no such element exists.
    #State: l is the index of the first element that does not satisfy the predicate, or l is equal to the length of arr if no such element exists
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function. It searches for the first element in `arr` that satisfies the predicate. If such an element is found, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns either the length of `arr` if no element satisfies the predicate, or `None` if no element satisfies the predicate.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and predicate is a function that takes an integer as input and returns a boolean.
def func_3(arr, predicate):
    return func_2(arr, predicate)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the predicate function returns True for all elements in the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a predicate function `predicate`. It checks if the predicate function returns True for every element in the list `arr`. If the predicate returns True for all elements, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), and predicate is a function that takes an integer and returns a boolean.
def func_4(arr, predicate):
    result = func_2(arr, predicate)
    if (result is not None) :
        return result + 1
        #The program returns the value of `result` plus 1, where `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`
    #State: Postcondition: `arr` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `result` is the return value of `func_2(arr, predicate)`, and `result` is `None`.
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of integers and a predicate function `predicate`. It calls `func_2(arr, predicate)` and returns the value of the result from `func_2` plus one, if `func_2` returns a non-None value. If `func_2` returns `None`, the function returns `None`.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30). l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query.
def func_5():
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer generated by the XOR operation of elements in `a`, and the value is a list of indices where that key appears in the list `x`. The list `x` is constructed by starting with `x[0] = 0` and then appending `x[-1] ^ i` for each `i` in `a`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The length of `x` is `len(a) + 1`.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][func_4(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or 0]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][func_3(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)]
        
        if upper > lower:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` in the range `q`, the program checks three conditions:
    #1. If `x[l-1]` is equal to `x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next iteration.
    #2. Otherwise, it finds the lower bound (`lower`) and upper bound (`upper`) of indices in `inds` where the keys match `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` respectively, considering the constraints provided by `func_3` and `func_4`.
    #3. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.
    #
    #The final output state will be a sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' based on these checks for each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list `a` of integers and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists any index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of the sublist `a[l-1:i]` is equal to the XOR of the sublist `a[i:r]`. If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.
