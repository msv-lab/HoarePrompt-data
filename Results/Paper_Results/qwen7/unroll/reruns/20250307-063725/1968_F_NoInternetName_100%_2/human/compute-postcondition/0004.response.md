Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where the key 0 maps to a list containing the value 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, and `x` is a list containing a single element 0.**

In this output state, the defaultdict `inds` has been updated such that the key `0` now maps to a list containing the value `0`. All other variables (`n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
