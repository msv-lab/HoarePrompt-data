Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop. Specifically, for each iteration `i` in the range `q`, the program checks three conditions:
1. If `x[l-1]` is equal to `x[r]`, it prints 'Yes' and continues to the next iteration.
2. Otherwise, it finds the lower bound (`lower`) and upper bound (`upper`) of indices in `inds` where the keys match `x[r]` and `x[l-1]` respectively, considering the constraints provided by `func_3` and `func_4`.
3. If `upper` is greater than `lower`, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' based on these checks for each iteration of the loop.
