Functionality: **The function processes a list `a` of integers and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists any index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of the sublist `a[l-1:i]` is equal to the XOR of the sublist `a[i:r]`. If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.**
