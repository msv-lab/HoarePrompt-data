Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer generated by the XOR operation of elements in `a`, and the value is a list of indices where that key appears in the list `x`. The list `x` is constructed by starting with `x[0] = 0` and then appending `x[-1] ^ i` for each `i` in `a`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The length of `x` is `len(a) + 1`.
