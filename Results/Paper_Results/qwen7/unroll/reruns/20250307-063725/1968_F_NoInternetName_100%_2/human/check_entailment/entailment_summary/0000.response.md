Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if a subarray can be divided into at least two parts such that the bitwise XOR of the elements in each part is the same.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1`: Converts a space-separated string of integers into a list of integers.
   - `func_2`: Binary search to find the first element in the array that satisfies a given predicate.
   - `func_3`: Checks if all elements in the array satisfy a given predicate.
   - `func_4`: Returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies a given predicate, adjusted by adding 1.
   - `func_5`: Processes the main logic to solve the problem.
3. **Key Logic in `func_5`**:
   - Computes the prefix XOR values and stores indices where each prefix XOR value occurs.
   - For each query, it checks if the prefix XOR from the start of the subarray to the start of the query range is the same as the prefix XOR at the end of the query range.
   - If not, it uses binary search to find the first occurrence of the prefix XOR value at the end of the query range before the start of the query range and compares it with the last occurrence of the prefix XOR value within the query range.
   - If such indices exist and satisfy the conditions, the subarray is considered interesting.

Given the detailed breakdown, the logic implemented in `func_5` correctly implements the required functionality to check if a subarray is interesting according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
