You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 5 : The function processes a list `a` of integers and for each query defined by `l` and `r`, it checks if there exists any index `i` in the range `[l, r]` such that the XOR of the sublist `a[l-1:i]` is equal to the XOR of the sublist `a[i:r]`. If such an index exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program attempts to use binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions, but this approach is flawed.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of XOR Prefixes**: The program tries to use binary search to find indices where the prefix XOR matches certain conditions. However, the logic for determining these indices is incorrect. The binary search functions `func_3` and `func_4` are not used appropriately to solve the problem.

2. **Misuse of Binary Search**: The binary search functions are not correctly utilized to find the appropriate indices for the XOR values. The logic inside `func_3` and `func_4` does not accurately reflect the necessary operations to determine if a subarray is interesting.

3. **Logic Flaws in XOR Matching**: The program checks if `x[l-1] == x[r]` to determine if the subarray is interesting, which is not sufficient. It also incorrectly uses binary search to find matching indices without properly accounting for the conditions required for the subarray to be interesting.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

Given the array `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` and the query `(1, 5)`:

- The prefix XOR values are: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 2]`.
- The subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` has a prefix XOR value of `2` at index `4`.

However, the program would incorrectly handle this case because it does not properly account for the conditions required to split the array into multiple parts with equal XOR values.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
