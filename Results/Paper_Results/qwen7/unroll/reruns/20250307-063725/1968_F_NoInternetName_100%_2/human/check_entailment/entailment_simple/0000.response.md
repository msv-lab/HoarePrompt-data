### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose**:
   - **func_1**: Converts a space-separated string of integers into a list of integers.
   - **func_2**: Implements binary search to find the first index where the predicate function returns `True`.
   - **func_3**: Calls `func_2` and returns its result.
   - **func_4**: Calls `func_2` and adds 1 to its result.
   - **func_5**: Processes the main logic to determine if a subarray is interesting.

2. **Main Logic in `func_5`**:
   - **Initialization**:
     - Reads `n` and `q` and constructs the array `a`.
     - Initializes `x` with `x[0] = 0` and populates it with cumulative XOR values.
     - Uses a `defaultdict` to store indices where each cumulative XOR value occurs.
   - **Query Processing**:
     - For each query, it checks if the cumulative XOR values at the start and end of the subarray are equal.
     - If they are equal, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the first and last occurrence of the required XOR values within the specified range and checks if the upper bound is greater than the lower bound.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_5` correctly identifies if a subarray is interesting by leveraging the properties of XOR and the precomputed indices stored in `inds`.
   - The binary search functions (`func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are implemented correctly and used appropriately.
   - The overall approach ensures that the subarray is divided into segments where the XOR values are equal, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the correct implementation of the functions and the logic in `func_5`, the program accurately determines if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: **True**
