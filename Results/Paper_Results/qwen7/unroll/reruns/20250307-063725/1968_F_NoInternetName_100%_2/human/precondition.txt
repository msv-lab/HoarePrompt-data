t is a positive integer; each test case consists of n and q, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5; the next line contains n integers a_1,...,a_n, where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}; each query is represented by two integers l and r, where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
