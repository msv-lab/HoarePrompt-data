Output State: `inds` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer in the range [0, 2^30) and the value is a list of integers representing the indices at which that integer appears in the list `x`. The list `x` is constructed by starting with `x[0] = 0` and for each `i` in `a`, appending `x[-1] ^ i` to `x`. The variable `n` and `q` remain unchanged, and `l`, `r`, and `x` are not directly involved in the loop and thus their states are not specified in the output.
