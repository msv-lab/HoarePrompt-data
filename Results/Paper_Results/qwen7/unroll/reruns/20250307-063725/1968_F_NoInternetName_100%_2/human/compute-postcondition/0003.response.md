Output State: **`inds` is a defaultdict where each key maps to a list, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `q` is a positive integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of integers where each element is in the range [0, 2^30), `l` and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n for each query, and `x` is a list containing a single element 0.**

The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `inds` where each key maps to a list. This does not affect the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `l`, `r`, or `x`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
