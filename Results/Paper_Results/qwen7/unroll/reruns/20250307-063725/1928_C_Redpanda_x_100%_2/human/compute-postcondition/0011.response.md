Output State: i is 3, nn is 2, factors is {2: 2}, primes is [2].

Explanation: The loop provided does not modify any of the given variables (`i`, `nn`, `factors`, or `primes`). It only contains a `yield` statement which does not assign any value to these variables or perform any operations on them. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged after the loop has executed all its iterations.
