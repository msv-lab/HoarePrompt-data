Postcondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, if k (the length of the list primes) equals the number of primes found, 1 is yielded. Otherwise, a sequence of numbers is generated based on the factors and prime numbers derived from the `rest` list. The sequence is created by multiplying the `factor` from the `rest` list with `prime_to_i`, which is incremented in a nested loop, running `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.**
