Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 1
    h = n - x
    ans = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))
    ans2 = set()
    if x != 1:
        h = n + x - 2
        ans2 = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))
    ans = ans.union(ans2)
    print(len(ans))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The variable `i` is 3, `nn` is 1, and `factors` is {2: 1}.
    if (nn > 1) :
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    #State: Postcondition: `i` is 3, `nn` is 2, and `factors` is {2: 2}, if `nn` is greater than 1.
    primes = list(factors.keys())
    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor
        
    #State: Output State: i is 3, nn is 2, factors is {2: 2}, primes is [2].
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify any of the variables `i`, `nn`, `factors`, or `primes`. It only contains a `yield` statement for each iteration over `generate(0)`, which does not affect the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values after the loop completes its execution.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers n and x where 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: t test cases, each test case generates a sequence of numbers based on the factors and prime numbers derived from the `rest` list. The sequence is generated by multiplying the `factor` from the `rest` list with `prime_to_i`, which is incremented in a nested loop. The outer loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.
    #State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, if k (the length of the list primes) equals the number of primes found, 1 is yielded. Otherwise, a sequence of numbers is generated based on the factors and prime numbers derived from the `rest` list. The sequence is created by multiplying the `factor` from the `rest` list with `prime_to_i`, which is incremented in a nested loop, running `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.
