Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem at hand. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not appear to be relevant to the problem of determining the number of possible values for `k` based on Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling process.

To solve the problem, we need to understand the pattern of the settling process and use it to determine the possible values of `k`. Hereâ€™s a correct approach to solve the problem:

```python
def count_possible_k(n, x):
    # The settling repeats every 2k-2 positions, so k must divide (n - x + k - 1)
    # We need to find all divisors of (n - x + k - 1) that are greater than 1
    possible_ks = []
    for k in range(2, n):
        if (n - x + k - 1) % k == 0:
            possible_ks.append(k)
    return len(possible_ks)

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_possible_k(n, x))
```

This code directly calculates the number of possible values for `k` based on the given constraints without using the unnecessary functions provided in the original solution.
