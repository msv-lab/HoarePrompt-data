Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers n and x where 1 â‰¤ x < n â‰¤ 10^9, k is equal to the length of the list primes, and 1 is yielded.**

The code `yield 1` simply yields the value `1`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `k`, or the list `primes`. It only adds `1` to the yielded values. Therefore, the output state remains as described in the initial state, with the addition that `1` is yielded.
