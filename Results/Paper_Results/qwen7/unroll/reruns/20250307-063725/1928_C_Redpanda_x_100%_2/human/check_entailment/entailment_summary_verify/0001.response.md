### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` fit the settling pattern described.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` must satisfy the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern depends on the value of `k`.

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to find all factors of `n`. However, it is incomplete and does not return the factors but instead yields an infinite sequence of factors.
   - **Function `generate`**: This function is supposed to generate all possible products of the prime factors of `n` raised to various powers. It is also incomplete and does not return the correct set of factors.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find all divisors of `2n - 2` because the settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - We then check which of these divisors can be written in the form `2k-2` where `k > 1`.
   - For each valid divisor `d`, we need to check if `x` fits the pattern for some `k` derived from `d`.

5. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The `func_1` function attempts to find factors of `n`, but it is not implemented correctly and yields an infinite sequence.
   - The `generate` function is meant to generate all possible products of prime factors, but it is also not implemented correctly and does not produce the required set of factors.

6. **Function Summaries**:
   - The summaries indicate that the functions should generate all possible products of prime factors, but they do not match the actual implementation details.
   - The summaries suggest that the functions should return a generator object with tuples `(n, x)`, but the actual implementation does not align with this.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. The summaries suggest a different approach than what is actually implemented, leading to an incorrect solution.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
