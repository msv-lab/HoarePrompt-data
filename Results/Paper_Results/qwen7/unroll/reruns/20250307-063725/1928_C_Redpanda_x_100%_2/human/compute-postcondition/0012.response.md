Output State: i is 3, nn is 2, factors is {2: 2}, primes is [2].

Explanation: The given loop does not modify any of the variables `i`, `nn`, `factors`, or `primes`. It only contains a `yield` statement for each iteration over `generate(0)`, which does not affect the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values after the loop completes its execution.
