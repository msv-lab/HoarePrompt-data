You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1
    primes = list(factors.keys())

    for factor in generate(0):
        yield factor

#Function 2:
def generate(k):
    if k == len(primes):
        yield 1
    else:
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `generate(k)` accepts a parameter `k`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it generates a sequence of numbers based on prime factors and yields a series of values. The final state of the program is that it returns a generator object producing tuples, each containing two integers `(n, x)` where `1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` fit the settling pattern described.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` must satisfy the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern depends on the value of `k`.

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to find all factors of `n`. However, it is incomplete and does not return the factors but instead yields an infinite sequence of factors.
   - **Function `generate`**: This function is supposed to generate all possible products of the prime factors of `n` raised to various powers. It is also incomplete and does not return the correct set of factors.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find all divisors of `2n - 2` because the settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - We then check which of these divisors can be written in the form `2k-2` where `k > 1`.
   - For each valid divisor `d`, we need to check if `x` fits the pattern for some `k` derived from `d`.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It attempts to generate factors but does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
