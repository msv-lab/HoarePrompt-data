You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i
        i += 1
    if nn > 1:
        factors[nn] = factors.get(nn, 0) + 1

            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())

    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:

    #Explanation: The given loop does not modify any of the variables `i`, `nn`, `factors`, or `primes`. It only contains a `yield` statement for each iteration over `generate(0)`, which does not affect the variables listed in the initial state. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values after the loop completes its execution.

        #State: t test cases, each test case generates a sequence of numbers based on the factors and prime numbers derived from the `rest` list. The sequence is generated by multiplying the `factor` from the `rest` list with `prime_to_i`, which is incremented in a nested loop. The outer loop runs `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.
    #State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, if k (the length of the list primes) equals the number of primes found, 1 is yielded. Otherwise, a sequence of numbers is generated based on the factors and prime numbers derived from the `rest` list. The sequence is created by multiplying the `factor` from the `rest` list with `prime_to_i`, which is incremented in a nested loop, running `factors[prime] + 1` times for each `factor`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not seem to address the problem description correctly. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not appear to be related to the problem of determining the number of possible values for `k` based on Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling. Instead, they seem to be dealing with prime factors and generating combinations of those factors, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many values of `k` fit the given constraints. Given Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received, we need to check how many values of `k` would result in `x` being the number at position `n` in the settling sequence.

Here’s a more appropriate solution:

```python
def count_possible_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    # Check for even k
    if n >= 2 * x:
        count += 1
    # Check for odd k
    if n >= 2 * x - 1:
        count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(count_possible_k(n, x))
```

This solution checks both even and odd values of `k` to see if they can produce the given position `n` with the given number `x`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `2*x`, there is at least one valid `k` (even). If `n` is also greater than or equal to `2*x - 1`, there is another valid `k` (odd).

Since the provided program does not implement this logic, it is incorrect.
