### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for `k` such that Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` fit the settling pattern described.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - Vasya's position `n` and the number he received `x` must satisfy the settling pattern.
   - The settling pattern depends on the value of `k`.

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to find all factors of `n`. However, it is incomplete and does not return the factors but instead yields an infinite sequence of factors.
   - **Function `generate`**: This function is supposed to generate all possible products of the prime factors of `n` raised to various powers. It is also incomplete and does not return the correct set of factors.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to find all divisors of `2n - 2` because the settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions.
   - We then check which of these divisors can be written in the form `2k-2` where `k > 1`.
   - For each valid divisor `d`, we need to check if `x` fits the pattern for some `k` derived from `d`.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It attempts to generate factors but does not correctly handle the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incomplete and does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
