Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x` where 1 â‰¤ `x` < `n` â‰¤ 10^9, and `k` is not equal to the length of the list of primes; `prime` is the `k`-th prime number in the list of primes; `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the `k`-th prime number from the list of primes to the variable `prime`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `k`, and `rest` remain unchanged from their initial states.
