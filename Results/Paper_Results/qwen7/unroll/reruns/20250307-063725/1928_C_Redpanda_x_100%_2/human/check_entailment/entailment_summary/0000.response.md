### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( x \) and the number \( x \) received during the settling match the described pattern.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - For a given \( x \), the number \( x \) can appear at positions that follow a specific pattern based on \( k \).
   - Specifically, \( x \) can appear at positions \( 1, 2, \ldots, k \) and then at positions \( k-1, k-2, \ldots, 2 \) in subsequent blocks of \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - It calculates the number of possible \( k \) values using the function `func_1(h)` which returns the prime factors of \( h \).
   - The function `func_1(h)` is used twice with different values of \( h \):
     - \( h = n - x \)
     - \( h = n + x - 2 \)
   - The results from both calls are combined using `union` to get all possible \( k \) values.
   - Finally, the length of the resulting set is printed, which gives the number of valid \( k \) values.

4. **Verification of Correctness:**
   - The logic in the code correctly identifies the conditions under which \( x \) can appear in the specified positions.
   - The use of `func_1` to find prime factors and generate possible \( k \) values is appropriate.
   - The handling of edge cases (like \( k = 1 \)) is correctly excluded since the problem statement specifies \( k > 1 \).

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
