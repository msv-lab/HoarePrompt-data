Output State: **The variable `low` will be equal to `high - 1`, `high` will be the index of the last element checked or `n` if `k` was not found, `pos` will be `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`, and `st` will contain all the indices from `low` to `high - 1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`. During each iteration, the middle index `mid` of the current search range is calculated and added to the set `st`. Depending on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`, the `low` or `high` boundary is adjusted. Once the loop exits, `low` will be one less than `high`, indicating the final search range. If `k` is found, `low` will eventually equal `high` and `pos` will be the index of `k`. If `k` is not found, `low` will be `high - 1` and `pos` will remain `-1`. The set `st` will contain all the indices that were checked during the binary search process.
