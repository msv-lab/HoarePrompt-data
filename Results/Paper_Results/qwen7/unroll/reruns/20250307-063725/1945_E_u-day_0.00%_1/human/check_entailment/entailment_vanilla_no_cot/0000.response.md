Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it attempts to find the position of `x` in the array using binary search directly, which is not the intended approach. The problem requires rearranging the array with at most two swaps to make the binary search start with `p_l = x`.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:
- The function `func_3` tries to find the position of `x` in the array and then performs a binary search to find the correct position.
- This approach does not consider the requirement to rearrange the array with at most two swaps to ensure the binary search starts with `p_l = x`.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Identify the position of `x` in the array.
2. Determine if swapping any two elements can achieve the desired result.
3. Output the necessary swaps if needed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
            break
    if pos == 0:
        print(0)
        return
    if arr[0] == k:
        print(0)
        return
    # Try to swap with the first element
    if arr[0] < k and arr[1] >= k:
        print(1)
        print(1, pos + 1)
        return
    # Try to swap with the last element
    if arr[-1] < k and arr[-2] >= k:
        print(1)
        print(pos + 1, n)
        return
    # Swap the first and last element
    print(2)
    print(1, n)
    print(pos + 1, n - 1)

# Main execution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_3()
```

This corrected version checks if `x` is already in the correct position or if it can be brought to the correct position with at most two swaps.
