### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation `p` of size `n` and a number `x` to find.
- We need to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that `p_l` (where `l` is the smallest index such that `p_l >= x`) equals `x`.
- After rearranging, we perform a binary search to find `x` and ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   
2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - Converts the result of `func_1` into a list of integers.
   
3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - Accepts `n`, `k`, and a list `arr` representing the permutation.
   - Searches for `k` in `arr` using binary search.
   - Prints `0` if `k` is found at `low + 1`.
   - Prints `1` and the positions of the swap if `k` is not found at `low + 1`.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_3` is supposed to find `k` in the permutation and perform at most 2 swaps to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The current implementation only performs a binary search and does not handle the swaps correctly.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The function `func_3` correctly identifies the position of `k` using binary search.
- However, it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The function assumes that the binary search will directly place `k` at `p_l`, which is not always true without proper rearrangement.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```
- The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The number to find is `3`.
- Binary search proceeds as follows:
  1. `low = 0`, `high = 5`.
  2. `mid = 2`, `arr[2] = 1`, so `high = 2`.
  3. `low = 0`, `high = 2`.
  4. `mid = 1`, `arr[1] = 3`, so `low = 1`.
- At this point, `low + 1 = 2` and `arr[2] = 1`, which is not equal to `3`.
- The function should swap elements to make `p_l` equal to `3`, but it does not perform any swaps and incorrectly prints `2`.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality because it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
