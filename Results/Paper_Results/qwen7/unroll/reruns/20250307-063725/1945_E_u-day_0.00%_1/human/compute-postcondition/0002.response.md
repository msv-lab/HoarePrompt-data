Output State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation.**

Explanation: The variable `pos` is assigned the value `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial states because no operations are performed on them in the given code snippet.
