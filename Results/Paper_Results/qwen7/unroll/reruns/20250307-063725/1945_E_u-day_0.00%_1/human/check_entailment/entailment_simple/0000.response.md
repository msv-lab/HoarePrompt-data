Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation such that the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at position \(l\).
2. The provided code does not actually perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it performs a binary search directly on the given permutation without any modifications.
3. The binary search logic in the code does not account for the fact that the array might need to be rearranged to ensure \(p_l = x\). Specifically, the code does not check or handle the case where the required swaps are needed to place \(x\) at the correct position.
4. The provided code does not implement the logic to find and perform the necessary swaps to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
