Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation array `p` so that the binary search finds the target value `x` at the position `l` after the search.
- The given code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the correct positions for the swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` after the binary search.
- Specifically, the code performs a binary search but does not account for the necessary swaps to place `x` in the correct position before the search.
- The code does not handle the logic to swap elements to achieve the desired permutation before performing the binary search.
- The provided code does not guarantee that the binary search will find `x` at the correct position `l` after the specified number of swaps (no more than 2).

Given these observations, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
