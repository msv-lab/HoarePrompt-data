You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing a permutation. It searches for the value `k` in the list `arr` and prints either `0` or `1` based on whether `k` is found. If `k` is found, it also prints the positions of `k` and the last element checked during the search. The function returns nothing but modifies the global variable `pos` to indicate the position of `k` if found, otherwise leaves it as `-1`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the function `func_3` is intended to find the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using binary search and then perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation does not perform any swaps and instead only prints the index `low + 1` if `arr[low] == k`.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
- The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The number to find is `3`.

The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. `low = 0`, `high = 5`.
2. `mid = 2`, `arr[2] = 1`, so `high = 2`.
3. `low = 0`, `high = 2`.
4. `mid = 1`, `arr[1] = 3`, so `low = 1`.

At this point, `low + 1 = 2` and `arr[2] = 1`, which is not equal to `3`. The program should swap elements to make `p_l` equal to `3`, but it does not perform any swaps and incorrectly prints `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The provided solution does not handle this requirement correctly.
