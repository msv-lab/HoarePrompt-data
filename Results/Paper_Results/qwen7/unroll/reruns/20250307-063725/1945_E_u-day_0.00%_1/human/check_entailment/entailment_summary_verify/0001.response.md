### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search approach. We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic provided in `func_3` is indeed incorrect because it does not actually perform any swaps. However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not perform any swaps at all. Let's analyze the function in detail:

   - The function `func_3` correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - It then attempts to perform a binary search, but it does not actually perform any swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` when the binary search completes.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_3` does not perform any swaps explicitly. However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not perform any swaps at all. The function should include the necessary logic to perform the swaps.
   - The binary search logic is incomplete and does not handle the required swaps. Specifically, the function should check if the binary search would work correctly with the current permutation and perform up to 2 swaps if necessary.

5. **Expected Solution**:
   - Find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Determine if the binary search would work correctly with the current permutation.
   - If not, perform up to 2 swaps to fix the permutation.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. It lacks the necessary steps to perform the swaps and ensure the binary search works as intended.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate in stating that the provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. The function `func_3` does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure the binary search works correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to perform the necessary swaps and ensure the binary search works correctly.
