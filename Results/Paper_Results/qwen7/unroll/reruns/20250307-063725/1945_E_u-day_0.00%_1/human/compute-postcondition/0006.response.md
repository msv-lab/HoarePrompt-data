Output State: **`low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1`; `pos` is the index in the list `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n - 1`. The value of `pos` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index in the list `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`.
