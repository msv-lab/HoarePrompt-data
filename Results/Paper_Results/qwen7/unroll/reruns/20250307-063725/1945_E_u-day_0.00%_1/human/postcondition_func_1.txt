The function accepts no parameters and returns a list. This list is generated by calling `func_1()`, which is expected to manipulate a permutation `p` of length `n` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`) based on given conditions involving `n` and `x` (where `1 ≤ x ≤ n`). The final state of the program is the returned list from `func_1()`.
