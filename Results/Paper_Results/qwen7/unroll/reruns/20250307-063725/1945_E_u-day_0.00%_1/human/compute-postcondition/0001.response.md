Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation; `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `func_1()`; `arr` is reassigned to the output of `func_2()`**.

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were assigned values by `func_1()`. The variable `arr` is updated to the new list returned by `func_2()`.
