Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` will be equal to `high - 1`
- `high` will be the index of the last element checked or `n` if `k` was not found
- `pos` will be `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`
- `st` will contain all the indices from `low` to `high - 1` inclusive
- `arr[low]` is equal to `k`

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
