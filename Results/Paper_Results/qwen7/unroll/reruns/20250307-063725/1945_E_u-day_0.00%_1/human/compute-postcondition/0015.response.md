Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` will be equal to `high - 1`
- `high` is the index of the last element checked or `n` if `k` was not found
- `pos` will be `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`
- `st` contains all the indices from `low` to `high - 1` inclusive
- The element at index `low` in `arr` is not equal to `k`

We need to determine the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

1. Since `low` is equal to `high - 1`, `low + 1` will be `high`.
2. `pos` is `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`. Therefore, `pos + 1` will be `0`.

So, the print statement will output `high` and `0`.

Output: **high, 0**
