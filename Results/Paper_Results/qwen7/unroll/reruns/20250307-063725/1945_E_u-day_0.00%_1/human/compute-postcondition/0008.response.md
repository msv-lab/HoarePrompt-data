Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is `n - 1`
   - `pos` is the index in the list `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`
   - `st` is an empty set

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Given `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 + 1 < n - 1` simplifies to `1 < n - 1` or `n > 2`.

Since the only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, and the condition depends on their values, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than `low + 1`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - `low` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed for `low`.
   - `high` must be greater than `low + 1`, which means `high` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `high` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` must be greater than 1, `pos` is the index in the list `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`, `st` is an empty set**
