Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the permutation; `n` and `k` are assigned values returned by `func_1()`**.

In this case, the function `func_1()` is called, which returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k`, but the description of their roles and constraints remains the same. The variable `arr` is not affected by this line of code.
