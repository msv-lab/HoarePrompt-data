Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns an integer.**

- If `k` is less than or equal to `n`, the function processes the permutation array `arr` and returns an integer based on the value of `k`.
- If `k` is not within the valid range (1 ≤ k ≤ n), the function's behavior is not specified in the given information.
