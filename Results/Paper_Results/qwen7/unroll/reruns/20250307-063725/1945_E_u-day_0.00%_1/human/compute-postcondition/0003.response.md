Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables in the Loop Head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n`: This is given as a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`.

3. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be 0, and `n` should be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - `n` must be a positive integer, which is already given as a condition.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
