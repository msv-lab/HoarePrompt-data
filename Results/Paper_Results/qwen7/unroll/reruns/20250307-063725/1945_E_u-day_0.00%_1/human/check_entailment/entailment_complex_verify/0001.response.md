### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search approach. We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic provided in `func_3` is indeed incorrect because it does not actually perform any swaps. Instead, it uses a set to store mid-values, which is unnecessary and does not contribute to the solution. The function should identify the correct position of `x` and perform the necessary swaps to ensure that the binary search works correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` when the binary search completes.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_3` does not perform any swaps. It only finds the position of `x` and attempts to use a set to track mid-values, which is not relevant to solving the problem.
   - The binary search logic is incomplete and does not handle the required swaps.

5. **Expected Solution**:
   - Find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Determine if the binary search would work correctly with the current permutation.
   - If not, perform up to 2 swaps to fix the permutation.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_3` does not perform any swaps and only prints `0` or `1` without modifying the permutation.
   - The function `func_2` is not defined, but it is expected to manipulate the permutation based on the given conditions.
   - The function `func_1` correctly reads and splits the input into integers.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. It lacks the necessary steps to perform the swaps and ensure the binary search works as intended.

8. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the assessment is accurate.

### Correctness:
