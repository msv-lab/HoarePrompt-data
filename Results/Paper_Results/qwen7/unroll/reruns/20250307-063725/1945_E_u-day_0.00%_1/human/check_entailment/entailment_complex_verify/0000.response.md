### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Definitions:
1. **func_1**: Reads a line of input and splits it into two integers.
2. **func_2**: Converts the result of `func_1` into a list.
3. **func_3**: Searches for the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using binary search and prints the necessary information.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- **func_3**:
  - Reads `n` and `k` from the input using `func_1`.
  - Calls `func_2` to get the permutation `arr` as a list.
  - Initializes `pos` to `-1` and iterates through `arr` to find the index of `k`.
  - Performs a binary search to find the appropriate position for `k` in the permutation.
  - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0`.
  - Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Issues with the Current Implementation:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search is correctly implemented, but it does not account for the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`.
2. **Swapping Elements**: The function does not perform any swaps, which is a critical part of the problem statement. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
- The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The number to find is `3`.

The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. `low = 0`, `high = 5`.
2. `mid = 2`, `arr[2] = 1`, so `high = 2`.
3. `low = 0`, `high = 2`.
4. `mid = 1`, `arr[1] = 3`, so `low = 1`.

At this point, `low + 1 = 2` and `arr[2] = 1`, which is not equal to `3`. The program should swap elements to make `p_l` equal to `3`, but it does not perform any swaps and incorrectly prints `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The provided solution does not handle this requirement correctly.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not perform the required swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
