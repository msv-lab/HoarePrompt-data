Postcondition: `low` will be equal to `high - 1`, `high` will be the index of the last element checked or `n` if `k` was not found, `pos` will be `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`, and `st` will contain all the indices from `low` to `high - 1` inclusive. Additionally, the value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
