Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\), and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing a permutation. It searches for the value `k` in the list `arr` and prints either `0` or `1` based on whether `k` is found. If `k` is found, it also prints the positions of `k` and the last element checked during the search. The function returns nothing but modifies the global variable `pos` to indicate the position of `k` if found, otherwise leaves it as `-1`.**
