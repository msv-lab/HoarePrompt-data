Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Program:

    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers, which are the result of splitting the input string based on spaces and converting each element to an integer.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, each test case consists of n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and x (1 ≤ x ≤ n) where n is the length of the permutation p, and p is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_1(), which we do not have the definition for, but it is expected to manipulate the permutation p based on the given conditions.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array arr, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.

    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is the index in the list `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: The variable `low` will be equal to `high - 1`, `high` will be the index of the last element checked or `n` if `k` was not found, `pos` will be `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`, and `st` will contain all the indices from `low` to `high - 1` inclusive.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high, 0
    #State: The variable `low` will be equal to `high - 1`, `high` will be the index of the last element checked or `n` if `k` was not found, `pos` will be `-1` if `k` was not found in the array `arr`, and `st` will contain all the indices from `low` to `high - 1` inclusive. Additionally, if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, then `pos` will be updated to `low`. Otherwise, `pos` remains `-1` and `st` remains unchanged.
