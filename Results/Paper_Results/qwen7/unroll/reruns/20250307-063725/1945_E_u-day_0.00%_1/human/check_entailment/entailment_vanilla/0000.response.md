### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find the position of `x` in the permutation `p` using a modified binary search. We can perform up to 2 swaps to make sure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is `x`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The provided code does not implement a binary search correctly. Instead, it searches for the position of `x` directly using a loop. This approach does not align with the problem's requirement to use binary search and swap elements to achieve the desired result.

3. **Swapping Elements**: The code attempts to swap elements to place `x` at the correct position. However, the logic for determining which elements to swap and when to perform the swaps is incorrect. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not correctly handle the binary search process and the necessary swaps.

4. **Output Format**: The function `func_3` prints the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped, but the logic for determining these swaps is flawed.

5. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we should:
   - Perform a binary search to find the position of `x`.
   - Swap elements if necessary to ensure that after the binary search, the element at position `l` is `x`.

Given the current implementation, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required binary search and swapping logic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
