### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to find a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search approach. We can perform up to 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

2. **Binary Search Logic**: The provided code in `func_3` indeed does not perform any swaps and incorrectly uses a set to store mid-values. However, the core issue is not just the use of the set but also the overall logic of the binary search.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x` when the binary search completes.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_3` does not perform any swaps.
   - It only finds the position of `x` and attempts to use a set to track mid-values, which is not relevant to solving the problem.
   - The binary search logic is incomplete and does not handle the required swaps.

5. **Expected Solution**:
   - Find the position of `x` in the permutation.
   - Determine if the binary search would work correctly with the current permutation.
   - If not, perform up to 2 swaps to fix the permutation.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code correctly identifies the state transitions but fails to show how the binary search logic should be implemented.
   - The `st` set is not used in the actual logic and is redundant.
   - The `low` and `high` pointers are used incorrectly in the binary search, as they do not reflect the correct indices for the swaps.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. It lacks the necessary steps to perform the swaps and ensure the binary search works as intended.

8. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as intended. The code does not perform the necessary swaps and the binary search logic is flawed.

### Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.
