Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the function `func_3` is intended to find the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using binary search and then perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation does not perform any swaps and instead only prints the index `low + 1` if `arr[low] == k`.

Here is an example where the program does not work as expected:

Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
- The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The number to find is `3`.

The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. `low = 0`, `high = 5`.
2. `mid = 2`, `arr[2] = 1`, so `high = 2`.
3. `low = 0`, `high = 2`.
4. `mid = 1`, `arr[1] = 3`, so `low = 1`.

At this point, `low + 1 = 2` and `arr[2] = 1`, which is not equal to `3`. The program should swap elements to make `p_l` equal to `3`, but it does not perform any swaps and incorrectly prints `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The provided solution does not handle this requirement correctly.
