Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: Reads a line of input and splits it into two integers. This function correctly reads the test case count and the permutation details.
   - **func_2()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` into a list. This function is not used in `func_3()`, but it seems to be part of the overall input processing.
   - **func_3()**: Implements the logic to find the position of `k` in the permutation `arr` using a modified binary search approach. The function aims to swap elements to ensure that `k` is found at the correct position after the binary search.

2. **Binary Search Modification**:
   - The function `func_3()` performs a binary search to find the position of `k` in the permutation. However, the problem statement requires us to perform swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search, which `func_3()` does not fully address. Specifically, `func_3()` does not handle the required swaps to ensure the permutation is in a form where binary search can correctly identify `k`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The problem specifies that we can perform up to 2 swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search. The provided code in `func_3()` does not include the necessary logic to perform these swaps. Instead, it directly attempts to find the position of `k` without ensuring the permutation is in a suitable order.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format requires specifying the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The provided code does not generate the required output format and does not account for the necessary swaps to make the permutation suitable for binary search.

Given the above points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
