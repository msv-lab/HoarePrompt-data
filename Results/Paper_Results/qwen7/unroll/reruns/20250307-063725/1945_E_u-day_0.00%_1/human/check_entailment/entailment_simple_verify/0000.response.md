### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
```
- This function reads a line of input, splits it into tokens, and converts each token to an integer using `map(int, ...)`.
- The output is a map object, which is then converted to a list in `func_2`.

#### Function `func_2`:
```python
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
```
- This function simply converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.

#### Function `func_3`:
```python
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        st.add(mid)
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```
- The function `func_3` takes the length `n` and the target value `k` from the input.
- It then reads the permutation `arr` from the input.
- It performs a binary search on `arr` to find the position of `k`.
- If `k` is found (`arr[low] == k`), it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
- If `k` is not found, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the binary search.
- The binary search is performed correctly, and the indices `low` and `high` are updated appropriately.
- However, the function `func_3` does not perform any swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. Instead, it directly prints the index `low + 1` if `k` is not found.

Given the problem statement, the function `func_3` is supposed to rearrange the permutation `arr` using at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The current implementation does not perform any swaps, which is a significant deviation from the problem requirements.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```
- The permutation is `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`.
- The number to find is `3`.

The binary search would proceed as follows:
1. `low = 0`, `high = 5`.
2. `mid = 2`, `arr[2] = 1`, so `high = 2`.
3. `low = 0`, `high = 2`.
4. `mid = 1`, `arr[1] = 3`, so `low = 1`.

At this point, `low + 1 = 2` and `arr[2] = 1`, which is not equal to `3`. The program should swap elements to make `p_l` equal to `3`, but it does not perform any swaps and incorrectly prints `2`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality because it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
