Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple parts, and converts those parts into integers. This function does not assign any values to existing variables or change their states; instead, it provides a way to read input data. Therefore, the only change is the introduction of the lambda function `R`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and any other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
