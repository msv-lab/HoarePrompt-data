Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input using `R = lambda: map(int, input().split())` and extracts `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of chosen vertices for each test case.
2. **Sorting and Modifying List**: It sorts the list of chosen vertices and appends `n + l[0]` to handle circular nature of the polygon.
3. **Calculating Differences**: The program calculates the differences between consecutive vertices in the sorted list, storing them in `val`. This step ensures that the differences account for the gaps between chosen vertices.
4. **Sorting Differences**: The list `val` is sorted with a custom key to prioritize even differences, which is crucial for forming triangles.
5. **Accumulating Values**: The program iterates through `val` and accumulates values in `sx` based on the condition involving `y` and the differences. This step ensures that the maximum number of triangles is formed without exceeding the limit `y`.
6. **Final Calculation**: The final value `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which represents the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the logic and steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. The steps ensure that the constraints are met and the maximum number of triangles is calculated accurately.

Correctness: **True**
