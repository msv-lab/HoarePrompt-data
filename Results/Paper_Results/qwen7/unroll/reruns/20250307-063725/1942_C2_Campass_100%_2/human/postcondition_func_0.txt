The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) along with \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). Based on these inputs, it calculates and prints a value \( \text{cons} \) which is defined as \( x + \text{sx} - 2 \), where \( \text{sx} \) is computed based on certain conditions involving \( y \) and the differences between the read integers. This process repeats for each test case until all \( t \) test cases are processed.
