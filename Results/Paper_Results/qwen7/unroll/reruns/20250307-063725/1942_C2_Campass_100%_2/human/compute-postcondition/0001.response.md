Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `t` is equal to the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` calls the lambda function `R()`, which returns a tuple of integers. The comma after `t` in the assignment statement indicates that only the first element of the tuple is assigned to `t`. Therefore, `t` is now equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`. The initial condition that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains valid.
