Output State: The output state will be the sum of `x` (which is the second element of the tuple returned by `R()` in each iteration) plus `sx` (which accumulates the value based on the conditions given in the loop) minus 2, printed for each iteration.

To break it down further:
- `t` starts as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- For each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned from the tuple returned by `R()`.
- A list `l` is created from another tuple returned by `R()`, sorted, and modified.
- A list `val` is created based on differences between elements of `l`.
- `val` is sorted again with a custom key.
- A variable `sx` accumulates values based on conditions involving `y` and elements of `val`.
- Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and printed.

Since the exact values of `R()` are not specified, we can't give a numerical output state. However, the process described above will be repeated until `t` reaches 0, at which point all iterations will have completed, and the final state will be the accumulated `cons` values printed during each iteration.
