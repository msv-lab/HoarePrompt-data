Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers n, x, and y (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It then returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each defined by three integers and a list of x distinct integers. The function does not take any direct parameters but operates on the input data provided according to the specified constraints.
