t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
