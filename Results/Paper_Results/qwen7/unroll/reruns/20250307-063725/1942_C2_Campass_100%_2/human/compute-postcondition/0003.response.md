Output State: The output state will be the sum of `x` (the second element of the tuple returned by `R()` in each iteration) plus `sx` (which accumulates the value based on certain conditions in the loop) minus 2, printed for each iteration.

To break it down:
- `t` starts as a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
- For each iteration of the while loop, `t` is decremented by 1.
- `n`, `x`, and `y` are obtained from the `R()` function.
- A list `l` is created from another call to `R()`, sorted, and modified.
- A list `val` is constructed based on differences between elements in `l`.
- `val` is sorted again with a specific key function.
- A variable `c` is calculated for each element in `val`, and based on the value of `y`, `sx` (a cumulative sum) is updated.
- Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and printed.

Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the results of `R()` are not specified, we can't provide a numerical output. However, the output state for each iteration will be the value of `cons` printed at the end of each iteration, which is `x + sx - 2`.
