### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and then `2n` integers from the input.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - The list `A` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
3. **Scoring:**
   - The program prints the sum of every second element in the sorted list `A`, i.e., `sum(A[::2])`.

4. **Optimality:**
   - The strategy of always selecting the two smallest numbers and adding the smaller one to the score is indeed optimal. By sorting the list and summing every second element starting from the first, we ensure that the smallest elements are added to the score first, which maximizes the total score.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided program does indeed implement the optimal strategy. Let's verify this using the example provided in the problem description.

#### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    1
    1
    2 3
    ```
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Sorting `[2, 3]` gives `[2, 3]`. Summing every second element starting from the first gives `2`.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    1
    2
    1 1 2 1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Sorting `[1, 1, 2, 1]` gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Summing every second element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 = 2`.

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: 
    ```
    1
    3
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    ```
  - Expected Output: `3`
  - Explanation: Sorting `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]` gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Summing every second element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The program correctly handles these examples and matches the expected outputs.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always selecting the two smallest numbers and adding the smaller one to the score.

**Final: True**
