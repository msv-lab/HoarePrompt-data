Output State: The output state will be a series of sums, each representing the sum of every second element (starting from the first element) in the sorted lists provided during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times. During each iteration, it reads a new value for `n` and a list of `2n` integers, sorts the list, and prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element. Since the initial value of `t` is given as an integer between 1 and 5000, the final output state will consist of `t` such sums, one for each iteration of the loop.
