Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers `A`.
3. **Scoring Calculation**: It then calculates the sum of every second element in the sorted list (`A[::2]`). This approach ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the minimum value chosen at each step, which aligns with the objective of maximizing the final score.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the program will produce the correct output for the provided examples and any other valid inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the program is correct.
