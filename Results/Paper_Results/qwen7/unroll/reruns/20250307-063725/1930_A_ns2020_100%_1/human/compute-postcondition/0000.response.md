Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the numbers written on the whiteboard (a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_{2n}) also remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 5000, while `n` and the list of numbers on the whiteboard retain their initial conditions.
