The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). Since `t` is non-zero by definition (it's an integer between 1 and 5000), no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**
