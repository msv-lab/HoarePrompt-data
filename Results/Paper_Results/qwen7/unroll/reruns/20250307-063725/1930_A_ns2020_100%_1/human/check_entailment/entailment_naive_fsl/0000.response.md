Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the two smallest numbers available on the whiteboard and adding the smaller one to the score. This ensures that the sum of the smallest elements (i.e., `A[::2]` after sorting) is maximized. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach guarantees the optimal solution for all valid inputs.
