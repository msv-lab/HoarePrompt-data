Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers. It then sorts the list in ascending order.
3. **Scoring Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the score by summing every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). This ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the minimum value chosen at each step.
4. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement, the strategy of pairing the smallest available numbers ensures the maximum possible score because the score is determined by the minimum of the two chosen numbers in each pair. By always choosing the smallest available numbers, we ensure that the minimum values in each pair are maximized.

Since the program correctly follows the optimal strategy and produces the expected results as per the example provided, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
