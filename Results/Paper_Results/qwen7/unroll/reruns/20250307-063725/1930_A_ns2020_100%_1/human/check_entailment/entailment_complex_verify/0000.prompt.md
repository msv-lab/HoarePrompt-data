You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers written on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a list of sums, each sum being the result of adding every second element (starting from the first element) of the sorted lists provided in each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until `t` becomes 0. During each iteration, the user inputs an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. These integers are sorted, and the sum of every second element starting from the first element is printed. Since the initial value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, the loop will execute this many times, each time processing a different set of input data. Therefore, the final output state will consist of `t` sums, each derived from the sorted input lists according to the specified rule.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and an integer `n`, along with `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the `2n` integers and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element. It repeats this process `t` times, outputting the sum for each test case. The final state of the program consists of a list of `t` sums, each derived from the sorted input lists according to the specified rule.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the two smallest numbers available on the whiteboard and adding the smaller one to the score. This ensures that the sum of the smallest elements (i.e., `A[::2]` after sorting) is maximized. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach guarantees the optimal solution for all valid inputs.
