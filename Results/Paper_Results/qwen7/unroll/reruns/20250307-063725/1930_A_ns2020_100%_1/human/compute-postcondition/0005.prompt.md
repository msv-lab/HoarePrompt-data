You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers written on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a list of sums, each sum being the result of adding every second element (starting from the first element) of the sorted lists provided in each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until `t` becomes 0. During each iteration, the user inputs an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. These integers are sorted, and the sum of every second element starting from the first element is printed. Since the initial value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, the loop will execute this many times, each time processing a different set of input data. Therefore, the final output state will consist of `t` sums, each derived from the sorted input lists according to the specified rule.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), along with 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
