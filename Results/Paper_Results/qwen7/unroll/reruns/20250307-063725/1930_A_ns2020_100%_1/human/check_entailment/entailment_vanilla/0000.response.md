### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two numbers \(x\) and \(y\) from the list, adding \(\min(x, y)\) to the score, and removing them from the list. This process is repeated until no numbers remain.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize the score, the optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available numbers. Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest two numbers in each iteration.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of numbers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums up every other element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.). This effectively pairs the smallest elements together and sums their minimum values.

4. **Verification**:
   - In the first test case (`2 3`), sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Summing every other element (starting from the first) gives `2`.
   - In the second test case (`1 1 2 1`), sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Summing every other element (starting from the first) gives `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - In the third test case (`1 1 1 1 1 1`), sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Summing every other element (starting from the first) gives `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Conclusion**: The implementation correctly follows the optimal strategy of always picking the smallest available numbers, which aligns with the problem's requirements.
