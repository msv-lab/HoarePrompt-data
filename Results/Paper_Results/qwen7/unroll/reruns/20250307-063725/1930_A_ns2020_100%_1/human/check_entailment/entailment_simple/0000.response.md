Reasoning:
The given annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.

2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. This ensures that when we take the minimum of pairs, we are always pairing the smallest available numbers first.

3. **Scoring Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the score by summing up every second element starting from the first element. This is because, in each pair `(x, y)`, the smaller number (`\min(x, y)`) is taken, and since the list is sorted, the first half of the elements (after sorting) will always be paired with the next smallest element, ensuring the maximum possible score.

4. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case, and the process repeats until all test cases are processed.

Given these steps, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case by always pairing the smallest available numbers, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.

Therefore, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
