Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and the `2n` integers from the input. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Sorting**: The integers are sorted in ascending order. Sorting ensures that when we take the minimum of pairs `(x, y)` where `x` and `y` are consecutive elements in the sorted list, we are effectively pairing the smallest available numbers together.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`). By sorting the array first, this approach maximizes the score because the smallest numbers are paired together, ensuring that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible.

4. **Output**: The calculated sum is printed for each test case, and the process repeats until all test cases are processed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it correctly computes the maximum possible score for each test case by always pairing the smallest available numbers together.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
