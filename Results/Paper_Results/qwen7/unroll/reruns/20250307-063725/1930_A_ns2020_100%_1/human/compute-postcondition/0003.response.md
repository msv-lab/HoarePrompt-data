Output State: The output state will be a list of sums, each sum being the result of adding every second element (starting from the first element) of the sorted lists provided in each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The loop continues until `t` becomes 0. During each iteration, the user inputs an integer `n` and a list of `2n` integers. These integers are sorted, and the sum of every second element starting from the first element is printed. Since the initial value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, the loop will execute this many times, each time processing a different set of input data. Therefore, the final output state will consist of `t` sums, each derived from the sorted input lists according to the specified rule.
