Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and an integer `n`, along with `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the `2n` integers and calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element. It repeats this process `t` times, outputting the sum for each test case. The final state of the program consists of a list of `t` sums, each derived from the sorted input lists according to the specified rule.**
