Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**: `tc` is an input integer where \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\).
3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**: For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `tc > 0` must be true.

Given that `tc` is already within the range \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\), it inherently satisfies the condition `tc > 0`. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for `tc`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head and all other variables retain their initial state, no additional states need to be adjusted.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tc` is an input integer where \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\)**
