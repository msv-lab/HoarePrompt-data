Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem. Specifically, the program calculates the XOR of the unique pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether this value is zero or not. However, this approach is incorrect because the game is more complex than just checking the XOR of unique pile sizes.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
2
1 1
2
2 2
3
1 2 3
```

- Expected Output:
```
Alice
Alice
Alice
```

However, the program outputs:
```
Bob
Bob
Alice
```

This is incorrect because in the first two cases, both players can always make a move until all piles are empty, so the player who starts (Alice) should win. In the third case, Alice can also win by making optimal moves.

The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the unique pile sizes, but the current implementation is flawed. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
