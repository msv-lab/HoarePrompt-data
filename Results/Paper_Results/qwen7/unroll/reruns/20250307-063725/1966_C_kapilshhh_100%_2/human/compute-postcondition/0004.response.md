Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns information about the initial number of stones in each of the n piles for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers representing the number of stones in each of the `n` piles. The function processes these inputs and provides information about the initial state of the stone piles for each test case.
