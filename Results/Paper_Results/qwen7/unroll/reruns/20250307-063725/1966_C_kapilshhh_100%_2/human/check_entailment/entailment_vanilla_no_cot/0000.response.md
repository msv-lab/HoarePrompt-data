Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic used in `dp` to determine the winner is flawed. The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to determine the winner based on the Nim game theory. Specifically, the XOR of the sizes of the piles should be used to determine the winner.
   
2. **Unnecessary Sorting and Set Operations:**
   - The code sorts the array and uses a set, which is unnecessary and can be simplified. We only need the unique values of the piles.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Piles:**
   - The code adds an extra `0` to the end of the sorted list, which is not required and can be removed.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        # Use XOR to determine the winner
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This version correctly determines the winner using the XOR operation on the pile sizes, which is the standard approach for this type of game (Nim game).
