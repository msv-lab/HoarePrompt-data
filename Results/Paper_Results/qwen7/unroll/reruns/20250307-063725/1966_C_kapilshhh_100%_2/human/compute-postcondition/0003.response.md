Output State: The output state will be a series of strings either "Alice" or "Bob", each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop based on the input provided during that iteration.

Explanation: During each iteration of the loop, the program reads an integer `n`, then a list of integers from the user input. It processes this list to determine whether Alice or Bob wins based on a specific condition involving the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted, unique list. The result ("Alice" or "Bob") is printed, and `tc` (which represents the number of test cases) is decremented. After all iterations are complete, the final output consists of these results printed in sequence.
