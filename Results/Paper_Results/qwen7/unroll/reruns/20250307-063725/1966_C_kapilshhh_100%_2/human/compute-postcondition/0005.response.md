Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then sorts and processes this list to determine whether Alice or Bob wins based on a specific condition involving the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted, unique list. The function prints "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case, indicating the winner. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of "Alice" or "Bob" results in sequence.**
