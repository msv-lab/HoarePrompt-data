Output State: **`tc` is an input integer where 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial state.**

Explanation: The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is presumably the same as `tc` in this context) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `tc`. The values of `n`, the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and all other variables remain unchanged.
