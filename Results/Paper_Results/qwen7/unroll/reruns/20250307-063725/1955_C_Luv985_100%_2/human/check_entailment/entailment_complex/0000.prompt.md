Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, where a_i represents the durability of the i-th ship.

    #
    #To explain further, for each test case (determined by the value of `T`), the code processes two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It then iteratively reduces pairs of elements from the ends of the list towards the center, subtracting up to `k` from the smaller of the two elements in each pair. If both elements in a pair become zero, they are counted towards `ans`. If `k` is not sufficient to make both elements zero, the remaining `k` is applied to one element, and if that element becomes zero, it is also counted towards `ans`. The process continues until no more reductions can be made or `k` is exhausted. After processing all test cases, `ans` contains the total count of elements that became zero across all test cases.
    #
    #The final value of `ans` will depend on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and the elements in `a` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it iteratively reduces pairs of elements from the ends of the list towards the center, subtracting up to `k` from the smaller of the two elements in each pair. If both elements in a pair become zero, they are counted towards the result. If `k` is not sufficient to make both elements zero, the remaining `k` is applied to one element, and if that element becomes zero, it is also counted towards the result. The process continues until no more reductions can be made or `k` is exhausted. The function returns the total count of elements that became zero across all test cases.
