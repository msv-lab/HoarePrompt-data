Output State: **T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which we assume is the same as `T`) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. All other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
