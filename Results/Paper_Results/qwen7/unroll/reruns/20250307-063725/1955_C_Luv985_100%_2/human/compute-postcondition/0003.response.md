Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the value of `ans` for each iteration of the outer while loop. Each `ans` is calculated based on the operations performed on the list `a` for the given `n` and `k`.

To break it down:
- For each iteration of the outer while loop, `T` is decremented.
- `n` and `k` are read from input.
- A list `a` of length `n` is populated with integers.
- Operations are performed on `a` to modify its elements and calculate `ans`.
- The final value of `ans` for each iteration is printed.

The exact output depends on the specific values of `n`, `k`, and the elements of `a` for each iteration. Since the problem does not provide specific input values, the output state can only be described in terms of the process and result of each iteration.
