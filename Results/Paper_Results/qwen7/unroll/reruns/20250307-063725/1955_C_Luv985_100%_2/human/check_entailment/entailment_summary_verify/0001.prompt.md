You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list `a` of `n` positive integers. For each test case, it iteratively reduces pairs of elements from the ends of the list towards the center, subtracting up to `k` from the smaller of the two elements in each pair. If both elements in a pair become zero, they are counted towards the result. If `k` is not sufficient to make both elements zero, the remaining `k` is applied to one element, and if that element becomes zero, it is also counted towards the result. The process continues until no more reductions can be made or `k` is exhausted. The function returns the total count of elements that became zero across all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `T`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` of ship durabilities.
2. **Loop Structure**: The program uses a while loop to handle multiple test cases, decrementing `T` until it reaches zero.
3. **Attack Logic**:
   - The program initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the first and last ship indices.
   - It iterates through the attacks using a while loop where `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If the total durability to be reduced (`mi * 2`) is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces both ships' durability by `mi` and decrements `k` accordingly.
   - If either ship's durability drops to zero, it increments the `ans` counter and adjusts the pointers.
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are insufficient to reduce the durability further, it breaks the loop.
4. **Final Check**: After exiting the loop, if the pointers meet at the same ship, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.
5. **Output**: The program prints the number of ships sunk.

### Testing:
- The example provided in the problem statement is correctly handled by the program.
- The logic ensures that ships are only attacked when their durability is greater than zero.
- The program handles the edge case where all ships sink before the specified number of attacks.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
