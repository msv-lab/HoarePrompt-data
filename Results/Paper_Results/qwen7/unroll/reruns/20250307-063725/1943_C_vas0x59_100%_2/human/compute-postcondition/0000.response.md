Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This integer is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000. The list `u2vs` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
