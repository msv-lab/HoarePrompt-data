Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list; `d` is a list of integers where each element is the shortest distance from vertex 0 to the corresponding vertex; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

This means that the function `func_1` has been called with the list `d` as its argument, and the return value of this function call has been assigned to the variable `a`. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `d` remain unchanged from their initial states.
