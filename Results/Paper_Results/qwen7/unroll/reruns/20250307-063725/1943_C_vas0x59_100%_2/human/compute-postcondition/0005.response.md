Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list; `d` is a list of integers where each element is the shortest distance from vertex 0 to the corresponding vertex.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from vertex 0. The BFS function returns two values: the first is a list `d` containing the shortest distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices, and the second is typically ignored (denoted by `_`). The BFS operation does not change the values of `n` or `u2vs`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial values, and only `d` is updated with the shortest distances.
