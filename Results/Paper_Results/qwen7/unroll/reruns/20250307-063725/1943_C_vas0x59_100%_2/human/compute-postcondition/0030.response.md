To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **Path Length Determination**:
   - `path_ba` is the shortest path from `b` back to `a`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1.

2. **Operations List Construction**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `path_ba[ci2]` of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to the second last index of `path_ba` with a step of 2.

3. **Length of `ops`**:
   - We need to determine the length of `ops` based on the conditions above.

Let's consider both cases:

### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- Let's assume the length of `path_ba` is `n` where `n` is odd.
- `ci = n // 2`.
- `ops` will contain tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `n // 2` inclusive.
- The number of tuples in `ops` will be `n // 2 + 1`.

### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even
- Let's assume the length of `path_ba` is `n` where `n` is even.
- `ci2 = n // 2 - 1`.
- `c1` is the element at index `ci2` of `path_ba`.
- `c2` is the element at index `path_ba[ci2]` of `path_ba`.
- `ops` will contain tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to the second last index of `path_ba` with a step of 2.
- The number of tuples in `ops` will be `(n - 2) // 2 + 1` (since we only include odd indices).

In both cases, the length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`. However, without the exact length of `path_ba`, we can generalize the result.

Given the general nature of the problem, we can conclude that the length of `ops` will be half the length of `path_ba` plus one if the length is odd, and half the length of `path_ba` minus one if the length is even.

Since the exact length of `path_ba` is not specified, we can represent the length of `ops` in a general form.

Output: **len(path_ba) // 2 + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, else len(path_ba) // 2**
