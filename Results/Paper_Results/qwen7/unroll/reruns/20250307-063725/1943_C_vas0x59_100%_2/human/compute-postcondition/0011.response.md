Output State: `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a`.

Explanation: The loop starts with `path_ba` containing the value `b`. In each iteration, it updates `n` to be the value of `previous` at the index given by the last element of `path_ba`. If `n` equals `-1`, the loop breaks, otherwise, it appends `n` to `path_ba`. This process continues until there is no valid predecessor for the current last element in `path_ba`. The final state of `path_ba` will be the shortest path from the vertex `b` back to the start vertex `a`.
