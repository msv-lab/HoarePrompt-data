Output State: `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the predecessor of the last element in `path_ba` to `path_ba` until it reaches the start vertex `a`. This process reconstructs the shortest path from `b` back to `a` using the information stored in the `previous` list. Once `n` (which is the predecessor of the current vertex) becomes `-1`, indicating there is no path to the start vertex, the loop breaks. Therefore, `path_ba` will contain the shortest path from `b` to `a`.
