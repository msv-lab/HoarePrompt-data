Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. This means that for each index from 0 to `n-1`, `u2vs` contains an empty list. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the structure of `u2vs` is now defined as specified.
