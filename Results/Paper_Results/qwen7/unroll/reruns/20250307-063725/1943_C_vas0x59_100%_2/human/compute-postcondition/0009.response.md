Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `b` to the list `path_ba`. Since `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
