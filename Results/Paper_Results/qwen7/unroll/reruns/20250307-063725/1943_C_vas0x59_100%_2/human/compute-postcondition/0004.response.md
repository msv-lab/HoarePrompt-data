Output State: `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2000; `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list. Each pair `(u, v)` from the input represents an undirected edge between vertices `u` and `v`, and both `u` and `v` are appended to each other's lists in `u2vs`.
