Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

In this case, the code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, and `func_1` is a function that takes `d` as its argument, `b` now holds the return value of `func_1(d)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
