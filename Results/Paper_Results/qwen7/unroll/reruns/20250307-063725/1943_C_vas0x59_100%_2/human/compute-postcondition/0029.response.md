Postcondition: **`path_ba` is the shortest path from `b` back to `a`. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `path_ba[ci2]` of `path_ba`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to the second last index of `path_ba` with a step of 2.**
