The function processes an input integer `n` and a list `u2vs` representing the edges of a tree. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find the shortest path from a specific vertex to another, constructs a list of operations based on the path found, and prints the number of operations and the operations themselves. The function does not return any value.
