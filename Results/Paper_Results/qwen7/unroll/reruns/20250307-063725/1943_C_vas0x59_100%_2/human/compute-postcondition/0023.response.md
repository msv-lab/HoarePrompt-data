Output State: **`ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a`, `ops` is an empty list, and the length of `path_ba` is even.**

Explanation: The variable `ci2` was originally the length of `path_ba` divided by 2. After executing `ci1 = ci2 - 1`, `ci1` is now one less than `ci2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
