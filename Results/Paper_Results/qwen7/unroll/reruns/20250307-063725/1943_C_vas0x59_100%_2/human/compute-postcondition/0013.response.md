Output State: **`d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a`, `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `ops`. This operation does not affect any of the existing variables (`d`, `previous`, `n`, `u2vs`, `b`, or `path_ba`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged, and the only new information is that `ops` is now an empty list.
