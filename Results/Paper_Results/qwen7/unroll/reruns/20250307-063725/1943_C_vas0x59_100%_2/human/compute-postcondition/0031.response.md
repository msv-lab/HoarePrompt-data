Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `path_ba` is the shortest path from `b` back to `a`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2.
     - `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
     - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1.
     - `c1` is the element at index `ci2` of `path_ba`.
     - `c2` is the element at index `ci2 + 1` of `path_ba`.
     - `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to the second last index of `path_ba` with a step of 2.

2. **Understanding the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`.
   - The lambda function formats each tuple `(x[0], x[1])` into a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - The results are then printed separated by newlines (`sep='\n'`).

3. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - We need to consider both the odd and even length cases for `path_ba`.

### Case 1: Length of `path_ba` is Odd
- Suppose `path_ba = ['b', 'p1', 'p2', 'p3', 'a']`.
- Here, the length of `path_ba` is 5 (odd).
- `ci = 5 // 2 = 2`.
- `c = path_ba[2] = 'p2'`.
- `ops = [('p2', 0), ('p2', 1), ('p2', 2)]`.

The output would be:
```
3 0
3 1
3 2
```

### Case 2: Length of `path_ba` is Even
- Suppose `path_ba = ['b', 'p1', 'p2', 'p3', 'p4', 'a']`.
- Here, the length of `path_ba` is 6 (even).
- `ci2 = 6 // 2 - 1 = 2`.
- `c1 = path_ba[2] = 'p2'`.
- `c2 = path_ba[3] = 'p3'`.
- `ops = [('p2', 1), ('p3', 3)]`.

The output would be:
```
3 1
5 3
```

Given the initial state does not specify the exact `path_ba`, we can provide a general answer based on the structure described.

### General Answer:
The output will depend on whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even. For an odd-length path, it will print tuples where the first element is `ci + 1` and the second element is the index. For an even-length path, it will print tuples where the first element alternates between `c1 + 1` and `c2 + 1` and the second element is the index.

Output: **3 0\n3 1\n3 2** (if `path_ba` is of odd length)  
or  
Output: **3 1\n5 3** (if `path_ba` is of even length)
