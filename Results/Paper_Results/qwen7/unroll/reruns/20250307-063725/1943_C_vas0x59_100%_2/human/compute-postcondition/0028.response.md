Output State: `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a`, `ops` is a list containing tuples (c1, i) and (c2, i) for every odd index `i` in the range from 1 to the second last index of `path_ba` with a step of 2, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `path_ba[ci2]` of `path_ba`, and the length of `path_ba` is even.
