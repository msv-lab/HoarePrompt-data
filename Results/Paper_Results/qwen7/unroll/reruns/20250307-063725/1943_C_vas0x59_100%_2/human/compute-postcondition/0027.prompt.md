Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `d` is the result of BFS starting from `a`, `previous` is a list representing the path from the start vertex to each vertex, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the set of vertices connected to the vertex indexed by the list's position in the `u2vs` list, `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from `b` back to `a`, `ops` is an empty list, `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `path_ba[ci2]` of `path_ba`, and the length of `path_ba` is even.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
