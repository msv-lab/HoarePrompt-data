Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the array \(a\) according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not ensure that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The program generates the array \(a\) as follows:
- \(a_1 = 1000\)
- \(a_2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002\)
- \(a_3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006\)

However, the condition \(x_3 = a_3 \bmod a_2\) should be satisfied, but here:
\[1 \neq 1006 \bmod 1002\]

This shows that the generated array \(a\) does not satisfy the required condition for the given input. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
