Output State: **The output will be a series of lists, each representing the cumulative sum sequence for the respective test case. Each list starts with 1000, followed by the cumulative sums of the input sequence for that test case.**

Explanation:
- The variable `t` represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, the user inputs a value for `n` (the length of the sequence) and then inputs a sequence of integers.
- A list `a` is initialized with the first element as 1000.
- For each subsequent element in the sequence, the value is added to the previous cumulative sum in the list `a`.
- The final output for each test case is a space-separated string of these cumulative sums, starting with 1000.
- This process repeats for each test case until `t` becomes zero, at which point the loop terminates.
