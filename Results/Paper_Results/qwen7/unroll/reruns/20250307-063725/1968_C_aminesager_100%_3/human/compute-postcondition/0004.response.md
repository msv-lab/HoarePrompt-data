Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a list `x` of n-1 integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). It then calculates the cumulative sum sequence starting with 1000 and appends each cumulative sum to a list. Finally, it prints the list for each test case as a space-separated string.**
