Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This means that `t` is now set to the integer value entered by the user, and it must be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this line of code.
