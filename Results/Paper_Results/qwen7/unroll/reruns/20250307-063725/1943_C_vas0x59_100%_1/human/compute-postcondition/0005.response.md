Output State: **`n` is an integer input value, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each index `i` contains a list of all indices `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the input graph, `d` is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `_` is the second return value from bfs which is not used.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the `bfs` function with the starting node `0`. The `bfs` function returns two values: `d` and `_`. The variable `d` is assigned the first return value, which represents the shortest distance from node `0` to all other nodes in the graph. The second return value is ignored and assigned to the variable `_`. The initial state of `n` and `u2vs` remains unchanged.
