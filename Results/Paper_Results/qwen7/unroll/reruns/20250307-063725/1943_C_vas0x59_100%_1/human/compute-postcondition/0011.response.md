Output State: `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`, `n` is an integer input value, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each index `i` contains a list of all indices `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the input graph, `d` is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `previous` is the variable storing the previous node in the BFS traversal, `a` is the return value from `func_1(d)` has been updated to the return value of `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `path_ba[-1]` to node 0.

Explanation: The loop continues until `n` becomes -1, which means it follows the `previous` pointers from the last node in `path_ba` back to the starting node (node 0). Each iteration of the loop appends the next node in the path to `path_ba`. Once `n` equals -1, the loop breaks, indicating that the entire shortest path from the last node in `path_ba` to node 0 has been traced. Therefore, `path_ba` now contains the shortest path from the last added node to node 0.
