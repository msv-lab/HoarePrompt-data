To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the conditions described:

1. **`ops` List Construction**:
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
     - `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even:
     - `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `2` of `path_ba`, and `i` ranges from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` in steps of `2`.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - `b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `n` is an integer input value.
   - `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists.
   - `d` is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS.
   - `previous` stores the previous node in the BFS traversal.
   - `a` is the return value from `func_1(d)` which has been updated to the return value of `bfs(a)`.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b` and a sequence of nodes forming a path from `b` back to `-1` as determined by the `previous` array during the BFS traversal until it reaches a node with value `-1`.

Given these details, we need to determine the length of `ops`. The length of `ops` depends on the length of `path_ba`:

- If `path_ba` is odd, the number of tuples in `ops` is determined by the range of `i` from `0` to `ci`, where `ci` is the index of the middle element. Since `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`, the number of tuples is `ci + 1`.
- If `path_ba` is even, the number of tuples in `ops` is determined by the range of `i` from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` in steps of `2`, where `ci1` is the index of the element at `ci1` in `path_ba`. The number of tuples is `(len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1) / 2 + 1`.

Without the exact length of `path_ba`, we cannot determine the precise number of tuples in `ops`. However, we can express the length of `ops` in terms of the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **len(path_ba) // 2 + 1 (where len(path_ba) is the length of the path_ba list)**
