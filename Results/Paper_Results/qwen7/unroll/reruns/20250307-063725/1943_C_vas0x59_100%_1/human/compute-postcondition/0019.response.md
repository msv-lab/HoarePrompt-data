Output State: `ops` is a list containing `(c, 0), (c, 1), ..., (c, ci)`. `b` remains the return value of `func_1(d)`, `n` remains the integer input value, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists, `d` remains the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `previous` remains the variable storing the previous node in the BFS traversal, `a` remains the return value from `func_1(d)` which has been updated to the return value of `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b` and a sequence of nodes forming a path from `b` back to `-1` as determined by the `previous` array during the BFS traversal until it reaches a node with value `-1`, `ci` remains the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `c` is the middle element of `path_ba`.
