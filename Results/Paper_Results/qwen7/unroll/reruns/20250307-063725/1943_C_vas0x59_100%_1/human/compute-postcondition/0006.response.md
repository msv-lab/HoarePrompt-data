Output State: **`n` is an integer input value, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each index `i` contains a list of all indices `j` such that there is an edge between `i` and `j` in the input graph, `d` is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `a` is the return value from `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `a`. Since `func_1` is not defined, we cannot determine the exact value of `a`, but we know that `a` is the result of calling `func_1` with `d` as its argument. The other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, and `d`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
