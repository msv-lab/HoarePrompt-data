Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, and `u2vs` is a list of lists where `u2vs[i]` is a list of integers representing the neighbors of vertex `i` in the tree. Each edge is represented exactly once in the input, and now `n` is set to an integer input value.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. This changes the value of `n` to the input integer, while the list `u2vs` remains unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree and that `u2vs` is a list of lists representing the neighbors of each vertex in the tree remains valid.
