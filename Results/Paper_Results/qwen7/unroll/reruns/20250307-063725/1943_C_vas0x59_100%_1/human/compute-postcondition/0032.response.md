Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown

1. **`ops`**: 
   - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
   - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `2` of `path_ba`, and `i` ranges from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` in steps of `2`.

2. **Other Variables**:
   - `b`: Return value of `func_1(d)`.
   - `n`: Integer input value.
   - `u2vs`: List of `n` empty lists.
   - `d`: Distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS.
   - `previous`: Variable storing the previous node in the BFS traversal.
   - `a`: Return value from `func_1(d)` which has been updated to the return value of `bfs(a)`.
   - `path_ba`: List containing the value `b` and a sequence of nodes forming a path from `b` back to `-1` as determined by the `previous` array during the BFS traversal until it reaches a node with value `-1`.

### Code Snippet Analysis

The code snippet is:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

This code maps over each tuple in `ops` and formats it as a string with the first element incremented by 1 and then joined with a newline character.

### Detailed Explanation

- **`ops`**:
  - If `path_ba` is odd, `ops` would contain tuples like `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`.
  - If `path_ba` is even, `ops` would contain tuples like `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `c1` and `c2` are specific elements from `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` in steps of `2`.

- **Mapping and Formatting**:
  - For each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`, the lambda function `lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` increments the first element `c` by 1 and formats it as a string with the incremented value and the second element `i`.

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: `path_ba` is odd
Suppose `path_ba = [1, 2, 3]` (odd length).
- `ops` would be `[(2, 0), (3, 1)]`.
- The map operation would produce `['3 0', '4 1']`.

#### Scenario 2: `path_ba` is even
Suppose `path_ba = [1, 2, 3, 4]` (even length).
- `ops` would be `[(2, 1), (3, 3)]`.
- The map operation would produce `['3 1', '4 3']`.

### Final Output

Given the above breakdown, the output will be a series of strings where each string is in the format `<incremented c> <i>` for each tuple in `ops`.

Output: **what is printed**

To provide a precise answer, we need the actual `path_ba` and the corresponding `ops`. However, based on the general structure, the output will be:

Output: **\n'.join(map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops))**
