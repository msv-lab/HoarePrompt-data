Postcondition: **`ops` is a list. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the middle element of `path_ba` and `i` ranges from `0` to `ci`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` or `(c2, i)` where `c1` is the element at index `ci1` of `path_ba`, `c2` is the element at index `2` of `path_ba`, and `i` ranges from `1` to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` in steps of `2`. `b` remains the return value of `func_1(d)`, `n` remains the integer input value, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists, `d` remains the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `previous` remains the variable storing the previous node in the BFS traversal, `a` remains the return value from `func_1(d)` which has been updated to the return value of `bfs(a)`, and `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b` and a sequence of nodes forming a path from `b` back to `-1` as determined by the `previous` array during the BFS traversal until it reaches a node with value `-1`.**
