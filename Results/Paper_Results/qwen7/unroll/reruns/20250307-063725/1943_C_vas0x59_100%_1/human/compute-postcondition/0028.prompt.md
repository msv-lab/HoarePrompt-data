Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ci1` is increased by 1; `c1` is the value of `path_ba[ci1]`; `ci2` is 2; `ops` is an empty list; `b` remains the return value of `func_1(d)`, `n` remains the integer input value, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists, `d` remains the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `previous` remains the variable storing the previous node in the BFS traversal, `a` remains the return value from `func_1(d)` which has been updated to the return value of `bfs(a)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b` and a sequence of nodes forming a path from `b` back to `-1` as determined by the `previous` array during the BFS traversal until it reaches a node with value `-1`, and the length of `path_ba` is even; `c2` is the value of `path_ba[2]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
    ops.append((c1, i))
    ops.append((c2, i))


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
