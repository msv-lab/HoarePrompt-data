Output State: **`n` is an integer input value, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. This means that for each vertex from 0 to `n-1`, there is now an empty list representing its neighbors. The value of `n` remains unchanged and is still an integer input value, and `u2vs` is updated to reflect this new structure.
