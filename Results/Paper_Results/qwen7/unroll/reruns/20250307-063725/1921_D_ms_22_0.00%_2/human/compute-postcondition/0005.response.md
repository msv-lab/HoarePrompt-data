Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It validates that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^5, with n â‰¤ m, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**

This description outlines the nature of the inputs indirectly through the constraints and the processing expected, without detailing the internal operations of the function.
