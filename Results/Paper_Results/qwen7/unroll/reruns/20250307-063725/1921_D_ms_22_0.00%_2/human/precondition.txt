t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the arrays a_i and b_i consist of n and m integers respectively, where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
