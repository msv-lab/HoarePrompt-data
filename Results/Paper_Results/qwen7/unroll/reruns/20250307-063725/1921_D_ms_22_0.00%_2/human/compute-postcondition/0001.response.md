Output State: **t is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, this condition is preserved. The other preconditions and conditions related to `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged and are still valid.
