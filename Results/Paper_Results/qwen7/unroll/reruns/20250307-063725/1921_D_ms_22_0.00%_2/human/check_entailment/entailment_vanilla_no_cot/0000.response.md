Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Choosing Elements:**
   - The logic for choosing elements from the sorted `b` array is flawed. The code attempts to push differences into a max heap but then uses a greedy approach to assign the closest available elements from `b`, which may not always yield the maximum difference.
   
2. **Heap Operations:**
   - The use of a max heap (`heapq` in Python) is unnecessary and complicates the logic. A simpler approach would be to directly select the largest and smallest elements from the sorted `b` array to maximize the differences.

3. **Index Management:**
   - The variables `tp1` and `tp2` are used to track indices in the `b` array, but their management is overly complex and not necessary for the problem.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    import heapq

    def solve():
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b.sort()

        # Calculate the maximum possible difference
        max_diff = 0
        for i in a:
            max_diff += abs(i - b[0]) + abs(i - b[-1])

        print(max_diff)

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        solve()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Sorting `b`:**
   - Sort the array `b` to easily access the smallest and largest elements.

2. **Calculating Maximum Difference:**
   - For each element in `a`, calculate the difference with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - Sum these differences to get the maximum possible total difference.

This approach ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient.
