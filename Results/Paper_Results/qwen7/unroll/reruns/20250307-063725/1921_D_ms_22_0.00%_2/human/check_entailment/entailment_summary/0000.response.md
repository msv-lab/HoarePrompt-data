Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts the array `b` and uses a max heap to keep track of the maximum differences.
4. The logic inside the loop iterates through each element of `a`, calculating the differences with the smallest and largest elements of `b`. It pushes these differences into a max heap.
5. After pushing the initial differences, the program pops elements from the heap and adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure they stay within the bounds of the subset of `b` that has not been used yet.
6. The program correctly updates the answer `ans` by adding the negative of the heap element (since it's a max heap storing negative values).
7. The program handles the constraints and ensures that the operations are performed within the limits specified.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic to maximize the total difference \(D\) by selecting the appropriate elements from `b` to minimize the absolute differences with `a`.

Correctness: **True**
