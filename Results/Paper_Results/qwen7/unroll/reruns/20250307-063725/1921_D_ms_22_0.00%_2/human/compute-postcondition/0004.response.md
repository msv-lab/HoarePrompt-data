Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. If `t` is 0, the variable `ans` contains the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements of array `a` and a subset of array `b` (of size `m`) after sorting and processing as described in the loop. Otherwise, no change is made to `t` and `ans` remains unchanged.**
