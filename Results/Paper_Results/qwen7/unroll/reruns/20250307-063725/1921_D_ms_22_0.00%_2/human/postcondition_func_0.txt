The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It calculates and returns the sum of the minimum absolute differences between elements of array a and a sorted subset of array b (of size m). The function ensures that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers within the specified ranges, with n â‰¤ m, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5. Additionally, a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 to 10^9.
