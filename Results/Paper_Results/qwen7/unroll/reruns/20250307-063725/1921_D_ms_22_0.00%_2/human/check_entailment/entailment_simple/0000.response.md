Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the array `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The array `b` is sorted, and a max heap is initialized to store the differences between elements of `a` and the chosen elements of `b`. This is a good approach to maximize the total difference.

3. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference. It correctly handles the conditions where the indices `tp1` and `tp2` are out of bounds, and it updates the indices and the answer accordingly. The logic for pushing elements into the heap and popping them to update the answer is sound.

4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which is the correct behavior.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be logically correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
