### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**:
   - The array `b` is sorted.
   - A max heap is initialized to store tuples of the form `(-difference, value, index)` where `difference` is the absolute difference between elements of `a` and `b`, and `index` is the position in `b`.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - For each element in `a`, the program calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in `b`.
   - It pushes the larger difference into the heap along with the corresponding index in `b`.

4. **Heap Processing**:
   - The program processes the heap to maximize the total difference `D`.
   - It ensures that the indices used for calculating differences do not exceed the bounds `tp1` and `tp2`.
   - If the current index in the heap is within the bounds, it directly adds the negative difference to `ans`. Otherwise, it recalculates the difference using the nearest available elements in `b` and adjusts the indices accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total difference `ans` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for pushing the larger difference into the heap and ensuring that the indices are within bounds is correct.
- The use of a max heap allows efficient selection of the largest differences.
- The processing of the heap and adjustment of indices ensure that the maximum possible difference is achieved.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference `D` between the arrays `a` and `c`.
