Postcondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. a_i and b_i are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i. The current execution is within the main function.**
