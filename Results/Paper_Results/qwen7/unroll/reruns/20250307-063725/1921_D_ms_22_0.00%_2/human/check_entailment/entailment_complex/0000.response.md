Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. It reads `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Sorting and Heap Initialization**: The program sorts the array `b` and initializes a max heap to keep track of the maximum differences. This setup is correct for finding the maximum total difference.

3. **Heap Operations**: For each element in `a`, the program calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in the current subarray of `b`. It pushes the larger of these differences into the heap. This ensures that the maximum possible difference is always considered first, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the total difference.

4. **Heap Processing**: The program processes the heap to ensure that the indices used for the differences are within bounds (`tp1` and `tp2`). If the indices are out of bounds, it adjusts them accordingly. This ensures that the maximum possible difference is always selected, and the total difference is maximized.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated total difference for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\) by always selecting the maximum possible difference at each step.

Correctness: **True**
