You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            val.append(c)
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates a value \( sx \) based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and a condition involving \( y \). Finally, it computes and prints \( cons \) as \( x + sx - 2 \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not handle the selection of additional vertices to maximize the number of triangular pieces of cake properly. 

Let's analyze the given example:

### Example Analysis

#### Input:
```
3
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```

#### Expected Output:
```
6
5
2
```

#### Program Output:
To understand why the program is incorrect, let's consider the first test case: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), and \( y = 2 \). The chosen vertices are \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \).

The program sorts the chosen vertices and calculates the differences between consecutive vertices. However, the logic for determining how many additional vertices to add to maximize the number of triangles is flawed. Here’s a breakdown of the issues:

1. **Sorting and Calculation**: The program sorts the vertices and calculates the differences between consecutive vertices. This step is correct.
   
2. **Maximizing Triangles**: The program attempts to maximize the number of triangles by adding half of the largest gaps. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum number of triangles. For instance, in the first test case, the differences are:
   - \( 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 \)
   - \( 2 - 6 - 1 = 1 \)
   - \( 5 - 2 - 1 = 2 \)
   - \( 1 - 5 - 1 = 1 \)

   The program adds half of the largest gap (4), which results in 2 additional vertices being added. This leads to 6 triangles, which is correct. However, the program does not account for the possibility of adding vertices in a way that might yield more triangles.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal solution involves adding vertices in a different manner. For example, in the third test case \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), and \( y = 2 \) with vertices \( 1, 3 \), the program incorrectly outputs 2 triangles instead of the correct 2 triangles.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the logic for maximizing the number of triangles. It fails to account for all possible configurations that could yield more triangles, especially in cases where the optimal solution involves adding vertices in a specific pattern. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
