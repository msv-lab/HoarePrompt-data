Reasoning:
1. The provided annotated program correctly follows the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The program reads the input as specified, ensuring \( t \) is the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) along with the chosen vertices.
3. The program sorts the list of chosen vertices and appends an additional element to handle the circular nature of the polygon.
4. It then calculates the differences between consecutive elements, sorts these differences based on specific criteria, and iterates through them to compute \( sx \).
5. The final value \( cons \) is calculated as \( x + sx - 2 \) and printed for each test case.
6. The logic for computing \( sx \) ensures that the number of triangles is maximized by choosing the appropriate number of additional vertices.

Given the detailed explanation and the structure of the code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
