Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `while t`. This means the loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `t` is now equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.

4. **Adjusting the State**: Since `t` is already a positive integer (as per the given constraints), it will be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

5. **Conclusion**: The current state already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute at least once.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is now equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`**.
