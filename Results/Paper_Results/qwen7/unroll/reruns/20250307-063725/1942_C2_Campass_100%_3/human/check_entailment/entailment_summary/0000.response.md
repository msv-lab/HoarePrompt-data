Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
2. It sorts the list of chosen vertices and appends the first element to the end to handle circular nature of the polygon.
3. It calculates `sx` by iterating through the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and applying a condition involving `y`.
4. The logic for calculating `sx` seems to aim at maximizing the number of triangles formed by non-intersecting diagonals.
5. The final calculation of `cons` as \( x + sx - 2 \) appears to be correct for determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Given the execution summary and the provided example, the program seems to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The logic for calculating the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
