Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `t` is now equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` calls the lambda function `R()`, which returns a tuple of integers. The unpacking assignment `t, = R()` assigns the first element of this tuple to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), after executing the code, `t` is now specifically set to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`. All other variables remain unchanged.
