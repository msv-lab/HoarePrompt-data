This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y. The second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be the sum of `x + sx - 2` for each iteration of the loop, where `sx` is calculated based on the operations within the loop.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the process:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: The variable `t` is initialized to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - In each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
    #   - New values `n`, `x`, and `y` are obtained from `R()`.
    #   - A list `l` is created from `R()` and sorted.
    #   - The list `l` is modified by appending `n + l[0]`.
    #   - A list `val` is created by calculating the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and storing them.
    #   - `val` is sorted based on specific criteria.
    #   - A value `sx` is computed by iterating over `val` and adding up values until `y` is less than half of the current value in `val`.
    #   - Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and printed.
    #
    #3. **Final Output**: After all iterations of the loop, the final output state will be the cumulative sum of `x + sx - 2` for each iteration.
    #
    #The exact numerical value of the output state cannot be determined without knowing the specific values returned by `R()` at each step, but it will always be a non-negative integer resulting from the described operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates a value \( sx \) based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and a condition involving \( y \). Finally, it computes and prints \( cons \) as \( x + sx - 2 \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
