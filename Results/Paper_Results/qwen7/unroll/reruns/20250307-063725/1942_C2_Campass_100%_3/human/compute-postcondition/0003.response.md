Output State: The final value of `cons`.

Explanation: The loop runs until `t` becomes zero. In each iteration, it performs several operations involving the results of calls to `R()`, but the exact values returned by `R()` are not specified. The loop modifies the variable `sx` and calculates `cons` based on the values of `x`, `sx`, and `y`. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list returned by `R()` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `cons`. However, the process described will always result in a single integer value for `cons` after the loop completes its iterations. Therefore, the output state is the final value of `cons` after all iterations of the loop.
