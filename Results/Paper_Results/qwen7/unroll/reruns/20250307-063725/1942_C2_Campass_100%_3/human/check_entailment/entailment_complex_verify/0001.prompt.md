You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be the sum of `x + sx - 2` for each iteration of the loop, where `sx` is calculated based on the operations within the loop.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the process:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: The variable `t` is initialized to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - In each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1.
    #   - New values `n`, `x`, and `y` are obtained from `R()`.
    #   - A list `l` is created from `R()` and sorted.
    #   - The list `l` is modified by appending `n + l[0]`.
    #   - A list `val` is created by calculating the differences between consecutive elements of `l` and storing them.
    #   - `val` is sorted based on specific criteria.
    #   - A value `sx` is computed by iterating over `val` and adding up values until `y` is less than half of the current value in `val`.
    #   - Finally, `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and printed.
    #
    #3. **Final Output**: After all iterations of the loop, the final output state will be the cumulative sum of `x + sx - 2` for each iteration.
    #
    #The exact numerical value of the output state cannot be determined without knowing the specific values returned by `R()` at each step, but it will always be a non-negative integer resulting from the described operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates a value \( sx \) based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and a condition involving \( y \). Finally, it computes and prints \( cons \) as \( x + sx - 2 \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting and Processing Vertices**:
   - The chosen vertices are stored in a list `l`.
   - The list `l` is sorted.
   - A new list `val` is created where each element is the number of vertices between consecutive chosen vertices minus one.

3. **Processing `val` List**:
   - The list `val` is sorted based on a custom key: `(1 - x & 1, x)`. This key ensures that elements with odd values are prioritized over even values of the same magnitude.
   - The program iterates through `val` and calculates the contribution to the total number of triangles based on the value of `y`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Triangles**:
   - For each element in `val`, the program checks if the current value of `y` is less than half of the current element (`c = i // 2`). If so, it adds `y * 2` to `sx` and breaks the loop.
   - Otherwise, it adds the entire element `i` to `sx` and reduces `y` by half of `i`.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - The final number of triangles is calculated as `cons = x + sx - 2`.

### Verification Against Example

Let's verify the program using the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  8 4 2
  1 6 2 5
  ```

- Steps:
  - `n = 8`, `x = 4`, `y = 2`
  - Chosen vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
  - Sorted vertices: `[1, 2, 5, 6]`
  - `val = [0, 2, 0, 2]`
  - Sorted `val`: `[0, 0, 2, 2]`
  - Iteration through `val`:
    - First element: `0 // 2 = 0` (no contribution)
    - Second element: `2 // 2 = 1` (contribute 2)
    - Third element: `0 // 2 = 0` (no contribution)
    - Fourth element: `2 // 2 = 1` (contribute 2)
  - Total contribution: `2 + 2 = 4`
  - Final triangles: `4 + 4 - 2 = 6`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: 
  ```
  7 3 1
  6 4 3
  ```

  - `n = 7`, `x = 3`, `y = 1`
  - Chosen vertices: `[6, 4, 3]`
  - Sorted vertices: `[3, 4, 6]`
  - `val = [2, 2]`
  - Sorted `val`: `[2, 2]`
  - Iteration through `val`:
    - First element: `2 // 2 = 1` (contribute 2)
    - Second element: `1 < 1` (break, add `1 * 2 = 2`)
  - Total contribution: `2`
  - Final triangles: `3 + 2 - 2 = 5`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: 
  ```
  4 2 2

  - `n = 4`, `x = 2`, `y = 2`
  - Chosen vertices: `[1, 3]`
  - Sorted vertices: `[1, 3]`
  - `val = [1]`
  - Sorted `val`: `[1]`
  - Iteration through `val`:
    - First element: `1 // 2 = 0` (no contribution)
    - Add remaining `y = 2` to `sx`
  - Total contribution: `2`
  - Final triangles: `2 + 2 - 2 = 2`
