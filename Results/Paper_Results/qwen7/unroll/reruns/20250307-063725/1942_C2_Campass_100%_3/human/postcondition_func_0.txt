The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It calculates a value \( sx \) based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list and a condition involving \( y \). Finally, it computes and prints \( cons \) as \( x + sx - 2 \) for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the result for each test case.
