Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all values of \(i-1\) found during the loop, `ansv` is a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `ansv` using a list comprehension, which includes all integers from 0 up to `mx-1`. This means `ansv` is a list of consecutive integers starting from 0 and ending at `mx-1`. The values of `mx` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged from their initial state.
