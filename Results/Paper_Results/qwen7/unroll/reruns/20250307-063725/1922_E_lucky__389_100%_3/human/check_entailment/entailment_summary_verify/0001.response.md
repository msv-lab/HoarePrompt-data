### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the provided solution. However, let's verify the solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness and completeness.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The solution uses a binary representation approach to achieve this.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: If `X` is 2, the solution correctly prints `[0]` because the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just 0).
   - **General Case**: For other values of `X`, the solution decomposes `X` into a sum of powers of 2. This is done by repeatedly finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracting it from `X`. The indices of these powers of 2 form the lengths of the increasing subsequences in the constructed array.
   - **Array Construction**: The array is constructed such that each integer from 0 to `mx-1` appears `len(subseq_lens) - 1` times. This ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case when `X` is 2.
   - For larger values of `X`, the solution constructs the array as expected. However, we need to check if it handles all possible values of `X` within the given constraints.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The solution prints the length of the array followed by the array itself. This format is correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Potential Issues**:
   - The solution does not explicitly handle the case when `X` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2. In such cases, the solution should print `-1` as specified in the problem statement.
   - The current implementation does not include a check for invalid `X` values. For example, if `X` is a number that cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, the solution will still proceed and may produce an incorrect array.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the original assessment cover valid cases. However, we need to verify if the solution handles invalid cases correctly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is mostly correct, but it does not fully address the potential edge cases where `X` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Therefore, the solution should include a check to handle such cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The solution needs to include a check to handle cases where `X` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and in such cases, it should print `-1`.
