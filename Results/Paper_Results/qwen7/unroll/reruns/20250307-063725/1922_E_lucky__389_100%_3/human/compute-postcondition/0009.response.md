Output State: **mx is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop, and subseq_lens is a list containing all values of \(i-1\) found during the loop.**

Explanation: The loop processes the integer `x` bit by bit from the highest bit to the lowest bit. For each bit position where `x` has a 1, it appends `i-1` to `subseq_lens` and subtracts \(2^{(i-1)}\) from `x`. The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `i-1` encountered during the process. After the loop completes, `mx` will hold the maximum length of any contiguous sequence of 1s in the binary representation of the original `x`, and `subseq_lens` will contain all lengths of such sequences.
