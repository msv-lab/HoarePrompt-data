Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing all values of \(i-1\) found during the loop.
- `ansv` is a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, with each integer appearing `len(subseq_lens) - 1` times.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the length of the list `ansv`.

The list `ansv` contains integers from 0 to `mx-1`, and each integer appears `len(subseq_lens) - 1` times. Therefore, the total number of elements in `ansv` is:

\[ \text{len(ansv)} = mx \times (\text{len(subseq_lens) - 1}) \]

However, since the exact values of `mx` and `len(subseq_lens)` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value. But we know the structure of `ansv` and how it is constructed.

Thus, the print statement will output the length of the list `ansv`, which is determined by the formula above.

Output: **mx \* (len(subseq_lens) - 1)**
