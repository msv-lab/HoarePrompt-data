Reasoning:

1. **Function Call and Input Handling**: 
   - The function `func_1()` is called after reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, `x` is read, which is the target number of increasing subsequences.
   - The logic in `func_1()` correctly handles the special case when `x == 2` by printing `[0]` as the array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).

2. **Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**:
   - The code uses a binary representation approach to find the necessary lengths of the subsequence. Specifically, it finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x` and subtracts it, repeating until `x` becomes zero.
   - This process ensures that the resulting sequence has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. Each power of 2 contributes to the count of increasing subsequences in a specific way, and the combination of these powers results in the desired count.

3. **Construction of the Result Array**:
   - The constructed array `ansv` is built by appending integers from 0 to `mx-1`, each appearing `len(subseq_lens) - 1` times.
   - This construction guarantees that the resulting array has the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The length of the constructed array is printed first, followed by the array itself.
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to generate an array with exactly `x` increasing subsequences for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
