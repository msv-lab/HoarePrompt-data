Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences is flawed. Here are some issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `X`**: The program attempts to decompose `X` into powers of 2 to determine the structure of the array. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, when `X` is a prime number, the decomposition method fails to produce a valid array.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The construction of the array `ansv` is based on the decomposed values of `subseq_lens`, which may not always result in the desired number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is a prime number greater than 2, which cannot be decomposed into a sum of distinct powers of 2.

To correctly solve the problem, one needs to use combinatorial methods to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences. A more appropriate approach would involve using factorization and combinatorial techniques to construct the array.
