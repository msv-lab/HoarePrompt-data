Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences. However, it does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to handle the case where `X` is a prime number greater than 2. For such cases, the program will incorrectly output an array, which does not meet the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

For example, consider the case where `X = 3`. According to the problem description, an array that meets the requirement could be `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`. However, the program will not generate this array because it only considers powers of 2 for the lengths of the increasing subsequences, and 3 is not a power of 2. Therefore, the program will output `-1` for `X = 3`, which is incorrect.

Since the program does not work correctly for at least one input (e.g., `X = 3`), the correctness is **False**.
