### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to generate an array of integers such that the number of its increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
   - The solution uses a binary decomposition approach to achieve this.

2. **Binary Decomposition Approach**:
   - The algorithm decomposes `X` into a sum of distinct powers of 2.
   - Each power of 2 corresponds to a length of an increasing subsequence in the generated array.
   - By placing these lengths in the array, we ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: When `X` is 2, the array `[0]` is outputted, which indeed has exactly 2 increasing subsequences.
   - **General Case**: For other values of `X`, the algorithm iteratively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `X`, subtracts it from `X`, and appends the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
   - **Array Construction**: The array `ansv` is constructed using the lengths stored in `subseq_lens`, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles the edge case where `X` is 2 by directly printing `[0]`.
   - For larger values of `X`, the algorithm correctly constructs the array by ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format is correct, and the array is constructed to have the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by `X`.

6. **Correctness of the Provided Solution**:
   - The provided solution correctly handles all the given test cases.
   - The logic for decomposing `X` into powers of 2 and constructing the array is sound and ensures the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Given the detailed analysis and the validation of the provided solution against the problem requirements and examples, the original assessment is accurate.
