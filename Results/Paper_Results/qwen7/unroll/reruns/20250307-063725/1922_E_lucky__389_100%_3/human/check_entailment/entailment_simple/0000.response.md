Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the integer `x` which represents the desired number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling `x = 2`**: The program correctly handles the special case where `x = 2`. It prints `1` and `0`, which is one of the possible arrays with exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the array `[0]`).

3. **General Case**: For other values of `x`, the program attempts to construct an array that has exactly `x` increasing subsequences. This is done using the following logic:
   - The program calculates the binary representation of `x` and uses it to determine the structure of the array.
   - It iterates over the bits of `x` to determine the lengths of the increasing subsequences needed.
   - It constructs the array by repeating integers from `0` to `mx-1` (`mx` being the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x`), ensuring that the total number of increasing subsequences matches `x`.

4. **Array Construction**: The constructed array is printed with the correct length and elements, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `x`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where `x` cannot be represented as a sum of distinct powers of 2, which would mean no such array exists. However, this specific edge case is not explicitly handled in the given code snippet, but the logic should cover such scenarios implicitly.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be sound and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
