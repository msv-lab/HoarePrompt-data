You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    print()
    #This is printed: nothing (the loop will print each integer from 0 to mx-1, each appearing len(subseq_lens) - 1 times, separated by spaces)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an input integer \(x\) and calculates a sequence based on certain conditions. It then prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself, where each integer from 0 to \(mx-1\) appears \(len(subseq\_lens) - 1\) times. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. The provided solution uses a binary representation approach to construct the array. Specifically, it decomposes `X` into a sum of powers of 2, which helps in constructing the desired array.
3. The algorithm works as follows:
   - If `X` is 2, it directly prints `[0]` since the array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just 0).
   - For other values of `X`, it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracts it from `X`. It repeats this process until `X` becomes 0.
   - The indices of these powers of 2 form the lengths of the increasing subsequences in the constructed array.
   - The array is then constructed using these lengths, ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
4. The solution handles all given constraints and examples correctly:
   - For `X = 2`, it correctly outputs `[0]`.
   - For `X = 5`, it correctly outputs `[0, 1, 0]` (which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: [], [0], [1], [0, 1], [0]).
   - For `X = 13`, it correctly outputs `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` (which has exactly 13 increasing subsequences).
   - For `X = 37`, it correctly outputs `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` (which has exactly 37 increasing subsequences).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and handles all the given test cases appropriately.
