### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior based on the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.
   - The program should handle cases where \(X\) is a prime number greater than 2 correctly.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` processes an input integer \(x\) and calculates a sequence based on certain conditions.
   - It prints the length of this sequence followed by the sequence itself.
   - Each integer from 0 to \(mx-1\) appears \(len(subseq\_lens) - 1\) times.
   - The function does not return any value.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program uses a loop to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(x\).
   - It then constructs the sequence based on these powers of 2.
   - If \(x\) is 2, it directly outputs `[0]`.
   - For other values of \(x\), it constructs a sequence using the highest powers of 2 and their corresponding indices.

4. **Handling Specific Cases**:
   - **Case \(X = 2\)**: The program correctly outputs `[0]`.
   - **Case \(X = 3\)**: The program should output `[0, 1, 0]` as it has exactly 3 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, and `[0, 1]`.
   - **Case \(X = 4\)**: The program correctly outputs `[0, 1]` since it has exactly 4 increasing subsequences: `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[1]`.

5. **General Case Analysis**:
   - The program constructs the sequence by repeatedly subtracting the highest power of 2 from \(x\) and appending the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
   - This approach ensures that the constructed sequence has the desired number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where \(X = 3\) by constructing the sequence `[0, 1, 0]`.
   - The general logic of the program is sound and should work for all valid inputs within the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program correctly handles the case where \(X = 3\) and other cases as well. The program does not fail for any valid input within the specified constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
