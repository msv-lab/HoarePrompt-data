You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the program incorrectly handles the reduction of durability and the conditions under which ships sink.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Durability Reduction**: The program attempts to reduce the durability of both the first and last ships simultaneously in each iteration of the loop. This is incorrect because the Kraken attacks either the first or the last ship in each turn, not both.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Sunk Ships**: The program does not properly handle the case where a ship's durability reaches zero and it is removed from further consideration. Instead, it continues to decrement the durability of the first and last ships until the loop condition is met, which can lead to incorrect results.

### Example Case Where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
- `n = 4`, `k = 5`
- `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`

#### Expected Output:
- After the first attack, the durability of the first ship becomes 0, and the array becomes `[2, 4, 3]`.
- After the second attack, the durability of the last ship becomes 2, and the array becomes `[2, 4, 2]`.
- After the third attack, the durability of the first ship becomes 1, and the array becomes `[1, 4, 2]`.
- After the fourth attack, the durability of the last ship becomes 1, and the array becomes `[1, 4, 1]`.
- After the fifth attack, the durability of the first ship becomes 0, and the array becomes `[4, 1]`.

The expected number of ships sunk is 2.

#### Actual Output by the Program:
The program incorrectly reduces the durability of both the first and last ships in each iteration, leading to an incorrect result. For instance, in the first iteration, it would reduce the durability of both the first and last ships, which is not correct.

Thus, the program fails to correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, and the output is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
