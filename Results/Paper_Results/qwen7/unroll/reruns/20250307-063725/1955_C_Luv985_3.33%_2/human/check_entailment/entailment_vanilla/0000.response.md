### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It also correctly reads the durability values of the ships and converts them into integers.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program initializes pointers `l` and `r` to track the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes `ans` to count the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until either `l` equals `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi`).
   - If the total durability of both ships (`mi * 2`) is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces their durability by `mi` and decrements `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If either ship's durability drops to zero, it increments `ans` and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) cannot fully reduce the durability of both ships, it handles the remaining attacks separately.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After exiting the main loop, if `l` equals `r`, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.
   - It prints the final count of sunk ships.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the last ship is the only one left and the remaining attacks can sink it.
   - It also handles cases where the durability of the ships is such that they cannot be fully reduced by the attacks.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
