Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which represents the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it takes an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), an integer k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and a list a of n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on the given inputs for each sub-case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of several integers and a list of integers. The function processes each test case according to the specified parameters and returns the results accordingly.
