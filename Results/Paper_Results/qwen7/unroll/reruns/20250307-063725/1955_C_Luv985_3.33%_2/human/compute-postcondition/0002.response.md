Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `T`.

2. **Understand the Condition for the Loop**: The loop condition is `T`. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be non-zero (i.e., `T != 0`).

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: The state given is `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `T` is an input integer.

4. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**: Since `t` is already within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), no adjustment is needed for `t`. However, `T` must be non-zero for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `T` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `T` must be non-zero**
