Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The code block is an empty comment block and does not affect the values of t, n, k, or a.**

The code provided is an empty comment block and does not contain any executable statements that would modify the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, or `a`. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged.
