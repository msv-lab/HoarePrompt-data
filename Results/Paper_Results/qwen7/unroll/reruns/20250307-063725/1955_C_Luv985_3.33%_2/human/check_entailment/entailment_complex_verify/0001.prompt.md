You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The value of `ans` will be the total number of elements in the list `a` that become zero after performing the specified operations for each pair `(n, k)` provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer \( n \) (number of elements in the list), an integer \( k \) (a limit value), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. The function performs operations to reduce the values in the list \( a \) by pairs of elements until either the elements are reduced to zero or the limit \( k \) is exhausted. The function counts the number of elements in the list \( a \) that become zero after performing these operations for each test case and prints the count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It also correctly reads the durability values of the ships and converts them into integers.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - The program initializes pointers `l` and `r` to track the first and last ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes `ans` to count the number of ships sunk.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues until either `l` equals `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi`).
   - If the total durability of both ships (`mi * 2`) is less than or equal to `k`, it reduces their durability by `mi` and decrements `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If either ship's durability drops to zero, it increments `ans` and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) cannot fully reduce the durability of both ships, it handles the remaining attacks separately.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After exiting the main loop, if `l` equals `r`, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship.
   - It prints the final count of sunk ships.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the last ship is the only one left and the remaining attacks can sink it.
   - It also handles cases where the durability of the ships is such that they cannot be fully reduced by the attacks.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
