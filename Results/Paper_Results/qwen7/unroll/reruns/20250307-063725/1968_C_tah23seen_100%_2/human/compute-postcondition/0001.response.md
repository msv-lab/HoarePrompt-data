Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4, `ans` is a list of n elements where each element is 10^9, `i` is n - 2.**

Explanation: The code simply assigns the value `n - 2` to the variable `i`. The lists `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged, and the variable `t` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is that `i` is now set to `n - 2`.
