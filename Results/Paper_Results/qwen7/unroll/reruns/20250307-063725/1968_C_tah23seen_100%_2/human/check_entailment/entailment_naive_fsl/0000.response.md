Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Let's consider a counterexample to illustrate this:

Given the input:
```
3
2 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \bmod a_1 = 1\)

However, the current implementation sets \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\), which does not guarantee that \(a_i\) will satisfy the modulo condition. For instance, if we set \(a_1 = 3\), then \(a_2 = 3 - 2 = 1\), but \(2 \bmod 1 = 0 \neq 1\).

A correct approach would involve setting \(a_i\) such that \(a_i = k \cdot a_{i-1} + x_i\) for some integer \(k\). However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Thus, the program fails to produce valid arrays `a` for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
