Output State: **The list `ans` will be modified such that each element `ans[i]` (for 0 <= i < n) will hold the value `t - sum(arr)`, where `sum(arr)` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The loop starts from `i = n - 2` and decrements `i` until it reaches 0. In each iteration, the value of `ans[i]` is updated to be the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that initially `ans[i]` is set to \(10^9\) for all `i`, and considering the nature of the loop, we can trace the changes:

1. For `i = n - 2`, `ans[n-2]` becomes `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`.
2. For `i = n - 3`, `ans[n-3]` becomes `ans[n-2] - arr[n-3]`, which further simplifies to `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2] - arr[n-3]`.
3. This process continues until `i = 0`, where `ans[0]` becomes `ans[1] - arr[0]`, which ultimately simplifies to `t - sum(arr)`.

Since `t` is a constant and `sum(arr)` is the sum of all elements in `arr`, the final value of each `ans[i]` will be `t - sum(arr)`.
