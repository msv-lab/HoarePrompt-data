You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: The list `ans` will be modified such that each element `ans[i]` (for 0 <= i < n) will hold the value `t - sum(arr)`, where `sum(arr)` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' where each element ans[i] is calculated as t minus the sum of all elements in the list 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `t`. It calculates and returns a new list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is equal to `t` minus the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of size `n-1`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with `arr` and `n` to get the result.
4. The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of size `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
5. It then iterates from `n-2` down to `0`, setting each element `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
6. This approach ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `2 \le i \le n`.

However, this approach has a flaw. Specifically, when calculating `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, it assumes that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i]`, the result will be negative, which is not valid since `a_i` must be a positive integer.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is at least `arr[i]` before performing the subtraction. We can achieve this by setting `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` if `ans[i + 1] < arr[i]`.

Let's modify the function `func_1` to handle this correctly:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i]:
            ans[i + 1] = arr[i]
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans
```

With this modification, the function should work correctly for all test cases.

Given the original implementation, the provided solution is incorrect due to the potential for negative values in `ans[i]`.

Correctness: **False**
