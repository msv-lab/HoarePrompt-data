#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers where 2 <= n <= 500 and 1 <= x_i <= 500 for all 2 <= i <= n, and t is an integer where 1 <= t <= 10^4.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: The list `ans` will be modified such that each element `ans[i]` (for 0 <= i < n) will hold the value `t - sum(arr)`, where `sum(arr)` is the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list 'ans' where each element ans[i] is calculated as t minus the sum of all elements in the list 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `t`. It calculates and returns a new list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is equal to `t` minus the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.
