Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is attempting to calculate each `a_i` such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \). However, the current implementation does not follow the correct approach to achieve this.

The intended logic should be:
1. Start from the last element of `arr` and work backwards.
2. For each `x_i`, find an appropriate `a_i` such that \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).
3. A simple way to ensure this is to set \( a_i = x_i + a_{i-1} \).

However, the current implementation sets each `a_i` to \( t - \text{sum}(arr) \), which does not satisfy the condition \( x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1} \).

Let's correct the function to properly generate the sequence:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[n-1] = 10 ** 9  # Initialize the last element to a large value
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        ans[i] = ans[i+1] - arr[i]
    
    return ans
```

This corrected function ensures that each `a_i` is calculated correctly according to the problem constraints.

Given the original code, the function does not meet the requirements, so the correctness is False.

Correctness: **False**
