Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The execution summary states that the function `func_1` calculates and returns a new list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is equal to `t` minus the sum of all elements in the list `arr`. This is incorrect based on the problem description, which requires constructing an array `a` such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

The given implementation of `func_1` does not follow the required logic. Instead of calculating the values based on the modulo operation, it subtracts the elements of `arr` from `t`, which is not relevant to the problem constraints.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
