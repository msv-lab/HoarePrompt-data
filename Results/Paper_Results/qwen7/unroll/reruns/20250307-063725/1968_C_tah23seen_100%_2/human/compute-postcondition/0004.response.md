Output State: **The program returns a list 'ans' where each element ans[i] is calculated as t minus the sum of all elements in the list 'arr'.**

This means that for each index `i` in the list `ans`, the value of `ans[i]` is `t - sum(arr)`, where `sum(arr)` is the total sum of all elements in the list `arr`. The value of `t` is not specified in the initial state, so it remains as a variable in the output state.
