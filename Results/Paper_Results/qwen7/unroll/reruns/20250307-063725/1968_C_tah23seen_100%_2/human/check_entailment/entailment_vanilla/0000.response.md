Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the array `arr` of size `n-1`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with `arr` and `n` to get the result.
4. The function `func_1` initializes an array `ans` of size `n` with all elements set to \(10^9\).
5. It then iterates from `n-2` down to `0`, setting each element `ans[i]` to `ans[i+1] - arr[i]`.
6. This approach ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true for all `2 \le i \le n`.

However, this approach has a flaw. Specifically, when calculating `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, it assumes that `ans[i + 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. If `ans[i + 1] < arr[i]`, the result will be negative, which is not valid since `a_i` must be a positive integer.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `ans[i + 1]` is at least `arr[i]` before performing the subtraction. We can achieve this by setting `ans[i]` to `ans[i + 1]` if `ans[i + 1] < arr[i]`.

Let's modify the function `func_1` to handle this correctly:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i]:
            ans[i + 1] = arr[i]
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans
```

With this modification, the function should work correctly for all test cases.

Given the original implementation, the provided solution is incorrect due to the potential for negative values in `ans[i]`.

Correctness: **False**
