Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a list of non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. For each test case, it performs a series of calculations based on differences between consecutive elements in the list and stores intermediate results in a list `b`. It then processes a set of queries, each consisting of two indices, and computes and prints the difference in values from `b` based on these indices. The final output consists of printed results for each query, reflecting the computed differences.**
