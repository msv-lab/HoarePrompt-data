Functionality: **The function accepts a list of parameters including a positive integer t, for each test case, an integer n, and a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. Additionally, it accepts an integer m, and for each query, two distinct integers x_i and y_i within the range 1 to n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the specified conditions.**

This means the function `func` takes a series of inputs where `t` represents the number of test cases, `n` is the size of the list `a` for each test case, `a` itself is a strictly increasing list of non-negative integers, `m` indicates the number of queries, and for each query, it receives two distinct indices `x_i` and `y_i`. The function then performs some operation based on these inputs and returns the result accordingly.
