Output State: The `counter` variable will be incremented for each position `i` where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, and the following conditions are met:

- If `i < n - 1` and `s1[i + 1]` is different from `s2[i + 1]` and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i + 1]`, then `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 2.
- Otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1.

The final value of `counter` will be the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, considering the special condition for consecutive differing bits in `s1`.

In simpler terms, the `counter` will count the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, but it will also increment the counter an additional time if there are two consecutive differing bits in `s1` at those positions.
