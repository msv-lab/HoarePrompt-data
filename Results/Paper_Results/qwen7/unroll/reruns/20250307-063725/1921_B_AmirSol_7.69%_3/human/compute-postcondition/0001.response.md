Output State: **`counter` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which does not affect the values of `counter`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
