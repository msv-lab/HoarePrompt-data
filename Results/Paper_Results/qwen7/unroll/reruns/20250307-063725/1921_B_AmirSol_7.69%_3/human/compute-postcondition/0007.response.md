Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns a count of the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, and increments this count by 1 for each pair of consecutive differing bits in `s1` at those positions.**
