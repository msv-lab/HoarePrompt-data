Output State: **The program returns the counter which counts the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, and additionally increments by 1 whenever there are two consecutive differing bits in `s1` at those positions.**

This means the program will iterate through the strings `s1` and `s2` character by character. For each position `i`, if `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, the counter is incremented by 1. If the conditions `i < n - 1`, `s1[i + 1]` is different from `s2[i + 1]`, and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i + 1]` are met, the counter is incremented by an additional 1 and `i` is incremented by 2. Otherwise, the counter is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 1. The process continues until the end of the strings is reached, and the final value of the counter is returned.
