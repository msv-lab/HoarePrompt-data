Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` into the desired state `s2`. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed.

Consider the following test case:
```
n = 4
s1 = "0101"
s2 = "1010"
```

- Initial state: `0101`
- Desired state: `1010`

The correct solution requires 2 operations:
1. Move the cat from the 2nd box to the 1st box (`0101` -> `1101`).
2. Move the cat from the 4th box to the 3rd box (`1101` -> `1010`).

However, the provided function will incorrectly count this as 3 operations:
1. Increment counter because `s1[0] != s2[0]` (`0101` -> `1101`).
2. Increment counter because `s1[1] != s2[1]` and `s1[1] != s1[2]` (`1101` -> `1001`).
3. Increment counter because `s1[3] != s2[3]` (`1001` -> `1010`).

This shows that the function does not correctly handle the logic for moving cats between boxes and does not account for the most efficient way to achieve the desired state. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
