Output State: The value of `counter` will be the number of positions `i` where `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, and the next element `s1[i+1]` (if it exists) is also not equal to `s2[i+1]` and is different from `s1[i]`. If such a pair is found, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` skips to `i+2`. Otherwise, `counter` is incremented by 1 and `i` moves to `i+1`.

In simpler terms, `counter` will count the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, with the additional condition that if a difference is found at position `i`, then the next position `i+1` must also show a difference with the corresponding elements in `s2`, and these differences must be between `s1[i]` and `s1[i+1]`.
