Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). Each operation involves either placing a cat, removing a cat, or moving a cat from one box to another.

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each box (position `i`).
   - If the current state `s1[i]` differs from the desired state `s2[i]`, it increments the counter.
   - There is a special condition for consecutive differing bits in `s1`: if `i < n - 1` and `s1[i]` is different from `s1[i + 1]` and both `s1[i]` and `s1[i + 1]` are different from `s2[i]` and `s2[i + 1]`, respectively, the counter is incremented by 1 and `i` skips to the next next box (i.e., `i += 2`).

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly counts the number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.
   - The special condition for consecutive differing bits ensures that any pair of consecutive differing bits in `s1` is counted only once, even though they might require multiple operations to correct.
   - The function correctly handles all given constraints and examples.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where no changes are needed (`s1 == s2`), returning 0.
   - It correctly handles cases with consecutive differing bits by ensuring they are counted only once.

Given the analysis, the function logic matches the problem requirements and correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed.

Correctness: **True**
