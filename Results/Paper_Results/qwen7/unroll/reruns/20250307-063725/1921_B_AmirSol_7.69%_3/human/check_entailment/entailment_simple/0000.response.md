Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of boxes (`n`), the initial state of the boxes (`s1`), and the desired state of the boxes (`s2`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a counter (`counter`) to zero.
   - It iterates through each position `i` in the strings `s1` and `s2`.
   - If `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, it checks if there are two consecutive differing bits in `s1` (i.e., `s1[i] != s1[i+1]` and `s2[i] != s2[i+1]`). If this condition is met, it increments the counter by 1 and skips the next position (`i += 2`). Otherwise, it increments the counter by 1 and moves to the next position (`i += 1`).
   - If `s1[i]` is the same as `s2[i]`, it simply moves to the next position (`i += 1`).

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The logic of counting the number of differing positions and adding an extra count for consecutive differing bits in `s1` is correct. This matches the problem statement's requirement to account for the special condition where two consecutive differing bits in `s1` should be counted as one operation.
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `i` reaches the end of the string without needing to check the next position.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the `counter`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.

Given the above analysis, the program logic aligns with the problem requirements and correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed.

Correctness: **True**
