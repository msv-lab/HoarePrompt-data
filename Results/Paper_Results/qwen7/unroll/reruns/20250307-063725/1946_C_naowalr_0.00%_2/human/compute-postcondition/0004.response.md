Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For each of the t sets of input data, it accepts two integers n and k, where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and a list of lists adj representing a tree where adj[i] contains the neighbors of vertex i. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints.**
