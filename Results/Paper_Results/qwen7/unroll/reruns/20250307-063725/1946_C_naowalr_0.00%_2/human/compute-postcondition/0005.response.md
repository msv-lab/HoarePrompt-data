Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 sets of input data. For each set, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( k \) along with a tree represented by an adjacency list \( adj \). It then determines the largest integer \( x \) such that it is possible to make at most \( k \) cuts in the tree and still have at least \( x \) nodes left uncut. The function prints this value \( x \) for each set of input data.**
