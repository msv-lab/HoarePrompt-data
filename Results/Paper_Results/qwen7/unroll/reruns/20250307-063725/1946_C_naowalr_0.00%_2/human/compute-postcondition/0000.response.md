Output State: **`t` is an integer with a value between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive)**.

The code reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is guaranteed to be within the range 1 to 10^4. All other variables (`n`, `k`, and `adj`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
