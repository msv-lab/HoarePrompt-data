You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed values resulting from the differences calculated within the nested loops based on the values generated by the lambda function `r()`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop starts with `t` decremented by 1 each iteration until `t` becomes 0.
    #- Inside the loop, `a` is assigned a tuple containing `-1000000000.0`, three random numbers generated by `r()`, and `2000000000.0`.
    #- A list `b` is initialized as `[0, 0]`.
    #- A for loop iterates over `a` using `zip` to get consecutive elements and calculates `v` as the difference between consecutive elements.
    #- The list `b` is updated based on the condition `v ** (v > x - w)` and `v ** (v > z - y)`.
    #- Another loop with variable `u` prints the difference between elements of `b` based on the values generated by `r()`.
    #- Since the exact values of `r()` are not provided, the output will consist of differences calculated from the random numbers generated by `r()`.
    #
    #The final output state will be a sequence of printed results from these calculations, which cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values generated by `r()` at each step.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t, an integer n, a list a of n integers, an integer m, and a set of queries. For each test case, it generates a list b through a series of calculations involving the elements of list a. It then responds to each query by printing the difference between specific elements of list b. The final output consists of a sequence of printed results, which are derived from the calculations performed on the input data.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of moving directly to another city is the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Given the unique closest city property, for each city \(i\), there is a unique city \(j\) such that the distance \(|a_i - a_j|\) is minimized compared to all other cities.
   - The provided solution uses a lambda function `r` to read input values and processes the input data in a specific manner.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities `a`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.
   - The array `a` is modified with sentinel values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` to handle edge cases more easily.
   - A list `b` is initialized to store cumulative costs.
   - The `for` loop iterates through the cities to compute the cost of moving to the closest city, updating the cumulative costs in `b`.
   - Finally, for each query, it calculates the minimum cost to travel between the specified cities using the precomputed cumulative costs stored in `b`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles the constraints well by using sentinel values and ensuring that the closest city is always uniquely defined.
   - The cumulative cost calculations seem to correctly account for the unique closest city property and the cost of moving directly to another city.

5. **Validation:**
   - The provided example matches the expected behavior of the code.
   - The logic appears sound and should work for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It handles all the requirements and constraints appropriately.
