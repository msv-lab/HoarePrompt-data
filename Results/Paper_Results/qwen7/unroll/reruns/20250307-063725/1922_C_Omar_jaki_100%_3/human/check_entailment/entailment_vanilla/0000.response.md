### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of moving directly to another city is the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Given the unique closest city property, for each city \(i\), there is a unique city \(j\) such that the distance \(|a_i - a_j|\) is minimized compared to all other cities.
   - The provided solution uses a lambda function `r` to read input values and processes the input data in a specific manner.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities `a`, the number of queries `m`, and the queries themselves.
   - The array `a` is modified with sentinel values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` to handle edge cases more easily.
   - A list `b` is initialized to store cumulative costs.
   - The `for` loop iterates through the cities to compute the cost of moving to the closest city, updating the cumulative costs in `b`.
   - Finally, for each query, it calculates the minimum cost to travel between the specified cities using the precomputed cumulative costs stored in `b`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles the constraints well by using sentinel values and ensuring that the closest city is always uniquely defined.
   - The cumulative cost calculations seem to correctly account for the unique closest city property and the cost of moving directly to another city.

5. **Validation:**
   - The provided example matches the expected behavior of the code.
   - The logic appears sound and should work for all valid inputs within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It handles all the requirements and constraints appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
