Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple integers, and maps each integer to an integer type. However, no actual input is taken or variables are assigned values within the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and the queries remain unchanged, and only the lambda function `r` is defined.
