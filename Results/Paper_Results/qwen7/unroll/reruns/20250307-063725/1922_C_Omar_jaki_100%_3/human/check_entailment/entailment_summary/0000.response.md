Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities, where the cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and moving to any other city costs the absolute difference in their coordinates.
2. **Key Observations**:
   - The closest city to any given city `i` is unique due to the strictly increasing nature of the coordinates.
   - The solution involves precomputing some values to efficiently answer the queries.
3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it constructs a list `a` with sentinel values at the start and end to handle edge cases.
   - It then computes a list `b` using a complex formula involving the differences between consecutive elements in `a`.
   - Finally, it processes each query by computing the required cost using the precomputed list `b`.

4. **Execution Summary Analysis**:
   - The summary indicates that the program correctly processes each test case and query by generating the necessary list `b` and using it to compute the minimum cost.
   - The output matches the expected results based on the problem statement.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
