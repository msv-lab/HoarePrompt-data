Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and for each query, two integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i). The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and queries, and returns the results accordingly without needing to define these parameters directly within the function signature.
