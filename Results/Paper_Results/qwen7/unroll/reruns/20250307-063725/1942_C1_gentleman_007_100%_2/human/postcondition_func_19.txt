The function `func_20` accepts a non-negative integer `x` (where `x` is at most 20) and returns either 0 or 1 based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 0 or 1, the function returns `x` directly. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, but due to the constraints, it will never reach this part of the code. The final result is always either 0 or 1.
