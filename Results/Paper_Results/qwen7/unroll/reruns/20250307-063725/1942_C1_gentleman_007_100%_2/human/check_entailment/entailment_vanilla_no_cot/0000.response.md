Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed given the constraints. However, none of the functions defined in the code are relevant to solving this specific problem.

To solve this problem, you would need to implement an algorithm that calculates how many triangles can be formed using the given vertices and the additional vertices you can choose. This involves understanding the combinatorial aspect of choosing vertices to form triangles and ensuring that the chosen diagonals do not intersect.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, you would likely need to use combinatorial mathematics and possibly dynamic programming or greedy algorithms to find the solution. The current set of functions does not provide any logic to achieve this.

Here's a high-level approach to solving the problem:
1. Calculate the total number of ways to form triangles using the given vertices.
2. Determine how many additional vertices can be used without causing intersections.
3. Maximize the number of triangles by considering the additional vertices.

Since the provided code does not include any relevant logic, the correctness is `False`.
