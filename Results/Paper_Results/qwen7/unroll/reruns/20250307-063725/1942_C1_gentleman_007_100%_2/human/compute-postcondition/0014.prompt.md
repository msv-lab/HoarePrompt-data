You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. Additionally, n is between 4 and 10^9, x is between 2 and the minimum of n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0.
def func_16(n, mod):
    if (mod == -1) :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]))
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` remains an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (unchanged), `y` remains an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen (unchanged), and `dearr` is a list where `dearr[0]` is `1`, `dearr[1]` is `0`, and for each index `i` from `2` to `n`, `dearr[i]` is calculated as `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])`.
    else :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod)
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` remains an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` remains an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen, `dearr` is a list of integers where for each `i` from 2 to `n`, `dearr[i] = (i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod`.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` remains an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (unchanged), `y` remains an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen (unchanged). Additionally, `dearr` is a list of integers where for each index `i` from `2` to `n`, `dearr[i]` is calculated as follows: 
    #- If `mod == -1`, then `dearr[i] = (i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])`.
    #- Otherwise, `dearr[i] = (i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod`.
    return dearr
    #The program returns a list `dearr` where for each index `i` from `2` to `n`, `dearr[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions involving `i`, `dearr[i - 1]`, `dearr[i - 2]`, and optionally `mod`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `mod`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `mod` is an integer used for modulo operation. The function returns a list `dearr` where for each index `i` from `2` to `n`, `dearr[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions involving `i`, `dearr[i - 1]`, `dearr[i - 2]`, and optionally `mod`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `dearr` where for each index `i` from `2` to `n`, `dearr[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions involving `i`, `dearr[i - 1]`, `dearr[i - 2]`, and optionally `mod`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
