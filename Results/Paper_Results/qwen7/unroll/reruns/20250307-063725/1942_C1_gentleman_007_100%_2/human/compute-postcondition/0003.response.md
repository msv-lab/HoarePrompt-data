To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

The loop condition is:
```python
while len(q):
```

This means the loop will execute as long as the length of the deque `q` is greater than 0.

Given states right before the loop:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\)
- `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\)
- `y` is 0
- `q` is a deque with the element `ver` appended to it
- `vis[ver]` is set to 1

The only variable in the loop head is `len(q)`, which depends on the deque `q`.

Since `q` is a deque with the element `ver` appended to it, `len(q)` is at least 1 (because it has at least one element). Therefore, the loop condition `len(q)` is true and the loop will definitely execute at least once.

No adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to execute the first time because the condition `len(q)` is already satisfied.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\), `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \times 10^5)\), `y` is 0, `q` is a deque with the element `ver` appended to it, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1**
