Reasoning:
The provided solution seems to be incomplete and does not match the problem description accurately. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a polygon. However, the code provided does not implement the logic to solve this problem. Instead, it contains a variety of unrelated functions that do not seem to contribute to solving the given problem.

Here is a brief analysis of the provided functions:
1. `func_1`, `func_2`: These functions read input but do not seem to be used in the main logic.
2. `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, `func_11`, `func_12`, `func_13`, `func_14`, `func_15`, `func_16`, `func_17`, `func_18`, `func_19`, `func_20`, `func_21`, `func_22`, `func_23`, `func_24`, `func_25`: These functions perform various operations like prime factorization, GCD computation, graph traversal, etc., which are not relevant to the problem of forming triangular pieces of cake.

Given that none of the provided functions appear to be related to solving the problem of maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake, we can conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
