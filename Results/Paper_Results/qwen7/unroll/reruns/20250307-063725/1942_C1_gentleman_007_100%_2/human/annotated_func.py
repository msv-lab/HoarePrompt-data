#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `p` of integers sorted in ascending order and an integer `x` such that 1 ≤ x ≤ max(p). If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `p`, it returns the length of `p`. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the largest index `mid` in `p` where `p[mid] < x` and returns `mid`. If no such index exists, it returns 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_20` accepts a non-negative integer `x` (where `x` is at most 20) and returns either 0 or 1 based on the value of `x`. If `x` is 0 or 1, the function returns `x` directly. Otherwise, it performs a binary search to find the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`, but due to the constraints, it will never reach this part of the code. The final result is always either 0 or 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `mod`. It calculates the value of `a` raised to the power of `b`, and then returns the result modulo `mod`.

    #The program returns the length of the sorted list 'l' which contains all unique elements from 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the length of a sorted list containing all unique elements from the input list. It achieves this by iterating through each element of the input list, maintaining a sorted list of unique elements, and updating this list accordingly.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices.

    #State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the vertices of the polygon, printed in a depth-first search order starting from the initial vertex 'ver'. The exact sequence depends on the structure of the graph (i.e., which vertices are adjacent to each other).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a starting vertex of a polygon, a dictionary `graph` containing adjacency information of the polygon's vertices, and a list `vis` indicating which vertices have been visited. It performs a depth-first search starting from the vertex `ver`. During the search, it prints the vertices in the order they are visited and marks them as visited in the `vis` list. The function does not return any value but modifies the `vis` list to indicate visited vertices.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of a graph starting from a specified vertex `ver`. It prints the vertices visited during the traversal in the order they were visited. The function takes a single parameter `ver`, which represents the starting vertex for the BFS. The graph structure is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
