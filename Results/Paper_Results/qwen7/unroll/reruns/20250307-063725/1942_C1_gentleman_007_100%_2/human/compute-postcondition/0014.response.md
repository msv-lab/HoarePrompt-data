Functionality: **The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `mod` is used for modulo operations. The function calculates a list `dearr` where each element from index 2 to `n` is computed based on the previous two elements and optionally the modulo value. If `mod` is -1, the calculation is performed without any modulo operation; otherwise, all calculations are done under modulo `mod`. The function returns the list `dearr`.**
