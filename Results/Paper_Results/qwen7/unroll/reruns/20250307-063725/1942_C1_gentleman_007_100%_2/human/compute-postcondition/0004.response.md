Output State: **The output state will be a space-separated sequence of integers representing a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of the graph starting from the vertex `ver`.**

Explanation: The loop performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph starting from the vertex `ver`. The `deque` `q` is used to manage the vertices to be visited next. Initially, `q` contains only the vertex `ver`, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1, indicating that `ver` has been visited. Inside the loop, the current vertex (`ver`) is printed, and then its unvisited neighbors are added to `q` and marked as visited. This process continues until `q` is empty, meaning all reachable vertices from `ver` have been visited and printed. The output is thus a BFS traversal of the graph starting from `ver`.
