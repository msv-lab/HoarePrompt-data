The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of a graph starting from a specified vertex `ver`. It prints the vertices visited during the traversal in the order they were visited. The function takes a single parameter `ver`, which represents the starting vertex for the BFS. The graph structure is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
