The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 4 to \(10^9\). It returns a dictionary `d` that contains the prime factorization of `n`. Each key in the dictionary represents a prime factor of `n`, and its corresponding value indicates the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization of `n`. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, the exponent of `n` itself is incremented by 1. If `n` is not greater than 1, the dictionary remains unchanged.
