Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into individual integer values based on spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers. This process handles multiple test cases where each case involves integers t, n, x, and y, along with a list of x distinct integers. The function does not modify any external variables and solely focuses on processing the input data provided.
Function number 2 :

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of sides of a polygon), `m` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers representing the vertices). It returns a 2D list where each sublist contains the same `m` integers from the list `v`, and there are `n` such sublists.
Function number 5 :

        l[y].append(x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices chosen by Bessie. The function constructs and returns a list of lists `l`, where for each index `i` from 0 to `n`, `l[i]` is a list containing `m` integers representing the vertices connected to vertex `i` by an undirected edge.
Function number 6 :

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a 2D list `l` of size (n+1)x(n+1). Initially, all elements in `l` are zero. The function then iterates `m` times, each time calling `func_1()` to get two vertex indices `x` and `y`. It sets `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` to 1, indicating an edge between vertices `x` and `y` in a graph. After these operations, the function returns the updated 2D list `l`, which contains `m` pairs of indices (x, y) where both `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1.

''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a 2D list `l` and returns a 2D list `p` of size (n+1) x (m+1). Each element `p[i][j]` in the returned list is computed using the formula `p[i][j] = p[i - 1][j] + p[i][j - 1] + l[i - 1][j - 1] - p[i - 1][j - 1]` for all valid indices `i` and `j`.

 Output hints for function12:  Functionality: The function `func_12` accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are their corresponding indices or any unique identifiers. It returns a dictionary `d` that contains the prime factorization of `num`, with each prime factor as a key and its exponent as the value. The function iterates through the prime factors of `num` using the `Prime_array` dictionary, updating a dictionary `d` to store the count of each prime factor.

Each key in the dictionary represents a prime factor of `n`, and its corresponding value indicates the exponent of that prime factor in the factorization of `n`. If `n` is a prime number greater than 1, the exponent of `n` itself is incremented by 1. If `n` is not greater than 1, the dictionary remains unchanged.
Function number 14 :
 Code:

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `mod` is used for modulo operations. The function calculates a list `dearr` where each element from index 2 to `n` is computed based on the previous two elements and optionally the modulo value.

If `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `p`, it returns the length of `p`.

It prints the vertices visited during the traversal in the order they were visited. The function takes a single parameter `ver`, which represents the starting vertex for the BFS. The graph structure is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.
