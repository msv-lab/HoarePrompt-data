n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and x, y are integers representing the vertices chosen by Bessie and the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen, respectively. It is also given that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0.
