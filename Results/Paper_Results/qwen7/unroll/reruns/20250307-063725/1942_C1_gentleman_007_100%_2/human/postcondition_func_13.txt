The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the keys are integers representing vertices of a polygon, and the values are non-negative integers indicating the number of times each vertex is chosen. It calculates the sum of \(i^{d[i] - 1} \times (i - 1)\) for each key `i` in the dictionary and returns this sum.
