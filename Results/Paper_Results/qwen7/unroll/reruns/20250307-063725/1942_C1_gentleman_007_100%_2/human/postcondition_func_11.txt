Functionality: The function `func_12` accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are their corresponding indices or any unique identifiers. It returns a dictionary `d` that contains the prime factorization of `num`, with each prime factor as a key and its exponent as the value. The function iterates through the prime factors of `num` using the `Prime_array` dictionary, updating a dictionary `d` to store the count of each prime factor. After processing all prime factors, the function returns the dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `num`.
