The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of sides of a polygon), `m` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers representing the vertices). It returns a 2D list where each sublist contains the same `m` integers from the list `v`, and there are `n` such sublists.
