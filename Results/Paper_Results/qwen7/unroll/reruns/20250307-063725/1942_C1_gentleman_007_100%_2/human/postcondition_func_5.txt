The function `func_6` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a 2D list `l` of size (n+1)x(n+1). Initially, all elements in `l` are zero. The function then iterates `m` times, each time calling `func_1()` to get two vertex indices `x` and `y`. It sets `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` to 1, indicating an edge between vertices `x` and `y` in a graph. After these operations, the function returns the updated 2D list `l`, which contains `m` pairs of indices (x, y) where both `l[x][y]` and `l[y][x]` are set to 1.
