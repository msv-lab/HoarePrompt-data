t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y = 0. The input for each test case includes a list of x distinct integers representing the chosen vertices. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
