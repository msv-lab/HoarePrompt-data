### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from a polygon with \( n \) sides, where \( x \) vertices are already chosen by Bessie and up to \( y \) additional vertices can be chosen. Since \( y = 0 \) in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Polygon Triangulation**: For a polygon with \( n \) sides, the number of triangles that can be formed without any intersections is \( n - 2 \). This is a well-known property of polygon triangulation.

3. **Given Constraints**:
   - \( n \) (number of sides) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of chosen vertices) ranges from 2 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are provided in the second line of each test case.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces for each test case.

5. **Function Summaries**:
   - Function 25 performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of a graph starting from a specified vertex. This is irrelevant to the problem.
   - Other functions are utility functions for various operations like prime factorization, combinatorial calculations, and graph traversal, which are also irrelevant to solving this specific problem.

6. **Core Requirement**: The core requirement is to calculate the number of triangles that can be formed from a polygon with \( n \) sides, which is simply \( n - 2 \).

7. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code includes many utility functions that are not needed to solve the problem.
   - There is no function that directly calculates \( n - 2 \) for the given \( n \).

8. **Function 25 Relevance**: Function 25 is a BFS implementation, which is completely unrelated to the problem of calculating polygon triangulation.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that addresses the core requirement of calculating the number of triangles in a polygon.
   - The code is incomplete and cannot solve the problem as stated.
