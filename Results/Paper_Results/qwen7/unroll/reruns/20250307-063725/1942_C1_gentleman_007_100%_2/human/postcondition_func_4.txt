The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices chosen by Bessie. The function constructs and returns a list of lists `l`, where for each index `i` from 0 to `n`, `l[i]` is a list containing `m` integers representing the vertices connected to vertex `i` by an undirected edge.
