Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `q` is a deque with the element `ver` appended to it, and `vis[ver]` is set to 1.**

The code `vis[ver] = 1` sets the value of `vis[ver]` to 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
