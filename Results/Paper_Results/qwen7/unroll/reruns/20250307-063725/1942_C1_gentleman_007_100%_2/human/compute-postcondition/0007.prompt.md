You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. The variable vis is a list or array of boolean values indicating whether a vertex has been visited, with the same length as the number of vertices in the polygon.
def func_24(ver):
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the vertices of the polygon, printed in a depth-first search order starting from the initial vertex 'ver'. The exact sequence depends on the structure of the graph (i.e., which vertices are adjacent to each other).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_24` accepts a parameter `ver`, which is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon. It also accepts a parameter `graph`, which is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. Additionally, it accepts a parameter `vis`, which is a list or array of boolean values indicating whether a vertex has been visited, with the same length as the number of vertices in the polygon.
#
#The function checks if the vertex `ver` has been visited according to the `vis` list. If `ver` has not been visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` is False), it marks `ver` as visited by setting `vis[ver]` to True and returns the list of adjacent vertices for `ver` from the `graph` dictionary. If `ver` has already been visited (i.e., `vis[ver]` is True), the function returns None.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_24` is to accept an integer `ver` representing a vertex of the polygon, a dictionary `graph` containing adjacency information, and a list `vis` indicating visited vertices. If the vertex `ver` has not been visited, it marks it as visited and returns its adjacent vertices; otherwise, it returns None.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
