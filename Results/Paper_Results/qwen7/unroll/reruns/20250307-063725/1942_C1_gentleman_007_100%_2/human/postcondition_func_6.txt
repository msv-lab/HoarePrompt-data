The function accepts a list of integers `l`, where each integer represents a unique vertex chosen by Bessie. It then creates a dictionary `d` where each key is a unique integer from the list `l`, and the corresponding value is the count of how many times that integer appears in the list `l`. After processing, the function returns this dictionary `d`.
