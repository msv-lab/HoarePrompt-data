The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into individual integer values based on spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers. This process handles multiple test cases where each case involves integers t, n, x, and y, along with a list of x distinct integers. The function does not modify any external variables and solely focuses on processing the input data provided.
