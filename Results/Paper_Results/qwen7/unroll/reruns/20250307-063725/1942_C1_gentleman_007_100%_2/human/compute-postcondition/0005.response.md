The function `func_25` accepts a parameter `ver`. `ver` is expected to be a list or similar structure containing t test cases. Each test case includes three integers: n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices. The function does not provide specific details on what it does with this input, but rather focuses on the structure and type of the input. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `ver`, which is a list containing t test cases. Each test case includes integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices.**
