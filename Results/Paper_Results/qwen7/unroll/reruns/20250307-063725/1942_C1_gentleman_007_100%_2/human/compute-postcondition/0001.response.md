Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that y = 0; `q` is a deque, and `q` has the element `ver` appended to it.**

The code `q.append(ver)` appends the element `ver` to the deque `q`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
