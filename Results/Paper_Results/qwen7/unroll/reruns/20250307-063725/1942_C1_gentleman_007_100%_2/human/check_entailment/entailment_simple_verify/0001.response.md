### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from a polygon with \( n \) sides, where \( x \) vertices are already chosen by Bessie and up to \( y \) additional vertices can be chosen. Since \( y = 0 \) in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Polygon Triangulation**: For a polygon with \( n \) sides, the number of triangles that can be formed without any intersections is \( n - 2 \). This is a well-known property of polygon triangulation.

3. **Given Constraints**:
   - \( n \) (number of sides) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of chosen vertices) ranges from 2 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are provided in the second line of each test case.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces for each test case.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that directly solves the problem. Instead, it includes a large number of utility functions for various operations like prime factorization, combinatorial calculations, and graph traversal, which are not relevant to solving this specific problem.
   - However, the code does include a function `func_3` that creates a list of `n` copies of a given list `v`. This function is not necessary for solving the problem but is included in the code.
   - The main logic for solving the problem is missing. Specifically, there is no function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed from the given vertices.

6. **Key Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads the input for a single test case.
   - The function `func_2` reads the input for a single test case and returns it as a list.
   - The function `func_3` creates a list of `n` copies of a given list `v`, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_4` creates a 2D list of `n` rows and `m` columns filled with a given list `v`, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_5` and `func_6` create adjacency lists and matrices, which are not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_7` counts the frequency of elements in a list, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_8` computes a prefix sum matrix, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_9` checks if a number is a power of 2, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_10` computes the GCD of a list, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_11` computes prime factors, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_12` computes the prime factorization of a number, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_13` computes the prime factorization of a number, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_14` computes a sum related to the prime factorization, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_15` computes factorial modulo a number, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_16` computes a dearrangement series, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_17` performs binary search, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_18` performs binary search, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_19` performs binary search, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_20` performs binary search, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_21` performs modular exponentiation, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_22` computes the longest common subsequence, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_23` computes the length of the longest increasing subsequence, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_24` performs a DFS traversal, which is not needed for solving the problem.
   - The function `func_25` performs a BFS traversal, which is not needed for solving the problem.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the provided code does not contain any function that addresses the core requirement of calculating the number of triangles that can be formed from a polygon, the program is incomplete and cannot solve the problem as stated.
