Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and `y` is an integer such that y = 0; `q` is a deque.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty deque `q`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, their ranges and initial values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `q` is now an empty deque.
