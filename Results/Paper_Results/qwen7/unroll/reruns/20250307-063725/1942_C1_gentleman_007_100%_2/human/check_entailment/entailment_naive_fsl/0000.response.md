Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon. However, the provided functions do not include any logic related to forming triangles or calculating the number of triangles that can be formed.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  8 4 0
  1 6 2 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

Given the vertices `1, 6, 2, 5` on an 8-sided polygon, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed is indeed 2. However, the provided code does not contain any function that calculates this value.

Since the program does not implement the required functionality, it cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
