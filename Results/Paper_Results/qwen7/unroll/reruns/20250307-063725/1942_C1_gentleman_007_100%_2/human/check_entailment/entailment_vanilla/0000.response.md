### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from a polygon with \( n \) sides, where \( x \) vertices are already chosen by Bessie and up to \( y \) additional vertices can be chosen. Since \( y = 0 \) in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Polygon Triangulation**: For a polygon with \( n \) sides, the number of triangles that can be formed without any intersections is \( n - 2 \). This is a well-known property of polygon triangulation.

3. **Given Constraints**:
   - \( n \) (number of sides) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of chosen vertices) ranges from 2 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are provided in the second line of each test case.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces for each test case.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that directly solves the problem. Instead, it includes a large number of utility functions for various operations like prime factorization, combinatorial calculations, and graph traversal, which are not relevant to solving this specific problem.
   - There is no function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed from a polygon, which is essential for solving this problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the provided code does not contain any function that addresses the core requirement of calculating the number of triangles in a polygon, the program is incomplete and cannot solve the problem as stated.
