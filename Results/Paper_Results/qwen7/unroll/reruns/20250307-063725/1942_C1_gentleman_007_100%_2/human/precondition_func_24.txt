t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. The input consists of t test cases, where each test case includes n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices.
