Output State: **`s` is a string that is the reversed longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` joined without any separators, and `l` is a list containing the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order.**

Explanation: The code `s = ''.join(l)` joins all elements of the list `l` into a single string `s` using no separator (hence the `''`). Since `l` contains the longest common subsequence of `a` and `b` in reverse order, `s` will be the reversed longest common subsequence when all elements of `l` are concatenated. The list `l` remains unchanged.
