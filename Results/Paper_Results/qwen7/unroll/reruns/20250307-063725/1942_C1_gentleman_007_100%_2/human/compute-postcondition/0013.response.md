Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `mod`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `mod` is an integer used for modulo operation. The function returns a list `dearr` where for each index `i` from `2` to `n`, `dearr[i]` is calculated based on the given conditions involving `i`, `dearr[i - 1]`, `dearr[i - 2]`, and optionally `mod`.**

This means the function calculates a list of values `dearr` where each value at index `i` (from `2` to `n`) is determined by specific conditions related to `i`, the previous two values in the list (`dearr[i - 1]` and `dearr[i - 2]`), and possibly a modulo operation with `mod`.
