The provided function `func_25` does not seem to be directly related to the problem description or the example problem. It appears to be a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) function used for traversing a graph, but it does not fit the context of the cake cutting problem described. Therefore, I will focus on extracting the precondition based on the problem description and the input variables in the function signature.

Given the problem description and the input variables in the function signature, here is the precondition:

```plaintext
Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. The input consists of t test cases, where each test case includes n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices.**
```

This precondition describes the constraints and types of the input variables for each test case.
