Functionality: **The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a starting vertex of a polygon, a dictionary `graph` containing adjacency information of the polygon's vertices, and a list `vis` indicating which vertices have been visited. It performs a depth-first search starting from the vertex `ver`. During the search, it prints the vertices in the order they are visited and marks them as visited in the `vis` list. The function does not return any value but modifies the `vis` list to indicate visited vertices.**
