You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #The program returns the length of the sorted list 'l' which contains all unique elements from 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the length of a sorted list containing all unique elements from the input list. It achieves this by iterating through each element of the input list, maintaining a sorted list of unique elements, and updating this list accordingly.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. The variable vis is a list or array of boolean values indicating whether a vertex has been visited, with the same length as the number of vertices in the polygon.
def func_24(ver):
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The output state will be a sequence of integers representing the vertices of the polygon, printed in a depth-first search order starting from the initial vertex 'ver'. The exact sequence depends on the structure of the graph (i.e., which vertices are adjacent to each other).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_24` accepts an integer `ver` representing a starting vertex of a polygon, a dictionary `graph` containing adjacency information of the polygon's vertices, and a list `vis` indicating which vertices have been visited. It performs a depth-first search starting from the vertex `ver`. During the search, it prints the vertices in the order they are visited and marks them as visited in the `vis` list. The function does not return any value but modifies the `vis` list to indicate visited vertices.

#Function 25:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. The input consists of t test cases, where each test case includes n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the chosen vertices.
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The output state will be a space-separated sequence of integers representing a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of the graph starting from the vertex `ver`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of a graph starting from a specified vertex `ver`. It prints the vertices visited during the traversal in the order they were visited. The function takes a single parameter `ver`, which represents the starting vertex for the BFS. The graph structure is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the code.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed from a polygon with \( n \) sides, where \( x \) vertices are already chosen by Bessie and up to \( y \) additional vertices can be chosen. Since \( y = 0 \) in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Polygon Triangulation**: For a polygon with \( n \) sides, the number of triangles that can be formed without any intersections is \( n - 2 \). This is a well-known property of polygon triangulation.

3. **Given Constraints**:
   - \( n \) (number of sides) ranges from 4 to \( 10^9 \).
   - \( x \) (number of chosen vertices) ranges from 2 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - \( y = 0 \), meaning no additional vertices can be chosen.

4. **Input and Output**:
   - Input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case provides \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - The vertices chosen by Bessie are provided in the second line of each test case.
   - The output should be the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces for each test case.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that directly solves the problem. Instead, it includes a large number of utility functions for various operations like prime factorization, combinatorial calculations, and graph traversal, which are not relevant to solving this specific problem.
   - There is no function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed from a polygon, which is essential for solving this problem.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the provided code does not contain any function that addresses the core requirement of calculating the number of triangles in a polygon, the program is incomplete and cannot solve the problem as stated.
