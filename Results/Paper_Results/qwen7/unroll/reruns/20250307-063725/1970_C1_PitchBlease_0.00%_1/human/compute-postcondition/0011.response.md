Postcondition: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key being a node and its value being a list of all nodes connected to it via edges; `leaves` is a list containing all nodes which have only one connection; `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS; `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS; **both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd numbers**.
