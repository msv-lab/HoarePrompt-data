You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and tree is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node in the tree. The `visited` set will contain all nodes that are reachable from the `start` node, including the `target` node. The `queue` will be empty after the loop finishes, as all nodes that can be reached will have been processed.
    #
    #In more detail, the `dist` variable will store the shortest path length from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set will include every node that can be reached from the `start` node, ensuring no cycles are revisited. The `queue` will be empty because all nodes that needed to be processed have been dequeued and their neighbors have been added to the queue.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `start`, an integer representing the starting node, and `target`, an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. It also accepts a dictionary named `tree` representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the target node is not found, the function returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
