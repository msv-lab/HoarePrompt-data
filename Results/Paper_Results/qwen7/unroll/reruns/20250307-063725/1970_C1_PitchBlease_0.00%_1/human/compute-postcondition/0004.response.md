Output State: The variable `dist` will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node in the tree. The `visited` set will contain all nodes that are reachable from the `start` node, including the `target` node. The `queue` will be empty after the loop finishes, as all nodes that can be reached will have been processed.

In more detail, the `dist` variable will store the shortest path length from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set will include every node that can be reached from the `start` node, ensuring no cycles are revisited. The `queue` will be empty because all nodes that needed to be processed have been dequeued and their neighbors have been added to the queue.
