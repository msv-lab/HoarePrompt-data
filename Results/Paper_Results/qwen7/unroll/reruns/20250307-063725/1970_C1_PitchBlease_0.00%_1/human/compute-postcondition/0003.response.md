Output State: The output state will be a tuple `(current, dist)` where `current` is the `target` node and `dist` is the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `queue`. Each iteration processes a node by checking if it is the `target` node. If it is, the function returns the distance `dist` which represents the shortest path found from the `start` node to the `target` node. If not, it explores all unvisited neighbors, updating their distances and adding them to the `queue`. Once the `target` node is found and returned, the loop terminates, and the output state will be the `target` node and the shortest distance to reach it.
