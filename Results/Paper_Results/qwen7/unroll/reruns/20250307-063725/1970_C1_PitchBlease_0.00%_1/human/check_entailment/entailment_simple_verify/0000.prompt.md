You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

The `visited` set will contain all nodes that are reachable from the `start` node, including the `target` node. The `queue` will be empty after the loop finishes, as all nodes that can be reached will have been processed.

    #In more detail, the `dist` variable will store the shortest path length from the `start` node to the `target` node. The `visited` set will include every node that can be reached from the `start` node, ensuring no cycles are revisited. The `queue` will be empty because all nodes that needed to be processed have been dequeued and their neighbors have been added to the queue.

    #The program returns -1




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the program calculates the distance from the starting node to each leaf and determines the winner based on whether these distances are even or odd. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of the players.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

Input:
```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```

In this case, the tree is structured such that node 5 is a leaf, and the other nodes form a path from node 1 to node 4. The program will calculate the distance from node 5 to the other leaf (node 1), which is 4 (an even number), and conclude that Ron wins. However, this is not necessarily true.

In the actual game, if the stone is placed on node 5, Ron can move the stone to node 4, and then Hermione has no valid move since she cannot move the stone to an inactive node. Therefore, Hermione loses, and Ron wins.

The program fails to consider the optimal moves of the players and only checks the distance from the starting node to the leaves. This is insufficient to determine the winner accurately.
