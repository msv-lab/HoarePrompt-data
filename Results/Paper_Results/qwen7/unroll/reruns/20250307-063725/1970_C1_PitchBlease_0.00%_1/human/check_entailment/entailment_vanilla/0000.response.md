### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Leaves Identification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly constructs the tree using an adjacency list.
   - It identifies the leaves of the tree by checking the degree of each node. This part is correct.

2. **BFS Function:**
   - The BFS function `bfs` is implemented correctly. It uses a queue to perform a breadth-first search from the start node to the target leaf node.
   - It returns the distance from the start node to the target leaf node, which is used to determine the winner.

3. **Winning Condition Calculation:**
   - The winning condition is determined by the distances from the start node to both leaves.
   - If any of these distances is even, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
   - This logic is implemented correctly in the `if` statement.

4. **Input and Output:**
   - The input format is correctly handled.
   - The output format is also correctly handled, returning either "Ron" or "Hermione".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the case where the tree has exactly two leaves, which is a requirement of the problem.
   - The BFS function will always find a path to the target leaf, and the distances will be non-negative integers.

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The overall logic of determining the winner based on the parity of distances is sound and matches the problem's requirements.
