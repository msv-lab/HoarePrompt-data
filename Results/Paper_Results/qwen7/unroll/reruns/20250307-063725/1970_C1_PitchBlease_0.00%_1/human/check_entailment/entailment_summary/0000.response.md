Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the parity of the shortest distances from the starting node to the two leaves of a tree.
2. `func_1` correctly constructs the tree and identifies the two leaves.
3. It uses `bfs` to calculate the shortest distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves.
4. The logic in `func_1` checks if either of these distances is even. If so, it returns 'Ron', otherwise 'Hermione'.
5. The `bfs` function correctly implements a breadth-first search to find the shortest path length from the starting node to the target node.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the provided functions correctly implement the solution. They handle the tree construction, identify the leaves, perform the BFS, and determine the winner based on the parity of the distances.

Correctness: **True**
