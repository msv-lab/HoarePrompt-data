Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node for a game. It constructs the tree structure, identifies the two leaves, calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are even or odd. If at least one distance is even, the function returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.**
