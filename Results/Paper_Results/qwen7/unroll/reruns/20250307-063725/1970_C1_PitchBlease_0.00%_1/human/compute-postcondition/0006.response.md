The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target`, which is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. The function also uses a dictionary named `tree` representing the adjacency list of the tree, where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.

The function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `bfs` is to accept a starting node and a target leaf from a tree represented by an adjacency list and return -1.
