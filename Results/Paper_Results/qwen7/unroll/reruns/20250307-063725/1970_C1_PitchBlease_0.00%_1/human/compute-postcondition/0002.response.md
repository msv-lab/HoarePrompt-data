The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `queue` is not empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0). Since the loop condition is `while queue`, and `queue` is already non-empty (containing at least one element), no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
