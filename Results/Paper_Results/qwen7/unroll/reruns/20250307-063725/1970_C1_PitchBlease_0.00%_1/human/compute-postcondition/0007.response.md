Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `start`, an integer representing the starting node, and `target`, an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. It also accepts a dictionary named `tree` representing the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the target node is not found, the function returns -1.**
