The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node for the game.

The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and all nodes are initially inactive. 

The function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`, and return either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the given conditions.
