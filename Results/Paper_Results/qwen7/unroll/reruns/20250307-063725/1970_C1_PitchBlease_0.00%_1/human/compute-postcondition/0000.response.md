Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `tree` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where each key is a node and its value is a list of neighboring nodes.**

The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This means the first element in the queue is a tuple where the first item is the starting node (`start`) and the second item is the distance from the start node, which is 0. The other variables (`target` and `tree`) remain unchanged.
