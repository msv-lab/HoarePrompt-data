You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling:**
   - The program uses a `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and constructs the tree using the `add_edge` method.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is called to root the tree at vertex 0 (this method is not defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to be implemented elsewhere).

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size (`func_4`):**
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining connected component of size at least `x`.
   - The `beg` and `end` variables are initialized to 1 and `n` respectively, representing the range of possible values for `x`.
   - The `mid` value is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and the `func_3` function is used to check if `mid` is a valid value for `x`.

3. **Checking Validity of `x` (`func_3`):**
   - The `func_3` function uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges.
   - `func_1` performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, then `func_3` returns `True`.

4. **Post-order Traversal and Component Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - The `func_1` function uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex based on the children's attributes.
   - The `postorder` flag is used to distinguish between the initial push and the final pop of each vertex.

5. **Recursive Calculation of Good Components and Remaining Size (`func_2`):**
   - The `func_2` function is a helper function for `func_1` and is used to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It traverses the children of each vertex and updates the attributes accordingly.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Tree Construction and Rooting:** 
  - The tree is correctly constructed and rooted using the provided input.
  - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is assumed to be correctly implemented.

- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct. It uses `func_3` to determine the validity of the midpoint value `x`.
  - The search range is correctly updated based on the result of `func_3`.

- **Component Calculation:**
  - The post-order traversal in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size.
  - The recursive calculation in `func_2` is consistent with the post-order traversal logic.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0, which would mean no edges are removed, and the entire tree is one component.
  - The program also handles cases where the tree is split into multiple components, ensuring that each component meets the size requirement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses a combination of binary search and post-order traversal to find the maximum component size `x` that satisfies the given conditions.
