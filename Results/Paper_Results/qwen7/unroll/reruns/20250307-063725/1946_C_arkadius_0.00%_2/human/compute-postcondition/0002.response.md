Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (exclusive), i.e., `i` takes values from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be able to take the value 1. This means `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Consider Other Relevant States:**
   - The other variables `n` and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.
   - The `tree` object is also not directly involved in the loop head, so its state doesn't need to be adjusted based on the loop execution.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
