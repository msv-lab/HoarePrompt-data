The function accepts an instance of a Tree class, the number of vertices in the tree, and the number of edges to be removed. It performs a binary search to find the smallest integer `beg` such that calling `func_3(tree, n, k, x)` with `x` starting from `beg` returns False. The function returns this integer `beg`.
