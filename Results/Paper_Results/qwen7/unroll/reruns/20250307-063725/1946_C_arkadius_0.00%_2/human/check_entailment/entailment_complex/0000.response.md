Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Construction**: 
   - The `Tree` class correctly represents a tree with nodes and edges. The `add_edge` method adds edges between nodes, and the `root_tree_non_recursive` method correctly initializes the tree structure by setting parents and calculating subtree sizes.

2. **Post-Order Traversal and Component Calculation**:
   - Function `func_1` performs a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree. This is done correctly by recursively updating the counts and sizes based on the children's results.

3. **Recursive Subtree Processing**:
   - Function `func_2` is a recursive helper function used by `func_1` to process each subtree and update the counts and sizes. It correctly accumulates the results from the children.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum \( x \)**:
   - Function `func_4` uses a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) such that removing \( k \) edges results in connected components of size at least \( x \). This is implemented correctly by adjusting the search bounds based on the results of `func_3`.

5. **Validation and Final Result**:
   - Function `func_3` checks whether the number of good components and their total size satisfy the conditions for the given \( x \). It correctly returns `True` if the conditions are met, otherwise `False`.
   - Function `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, and prints the result of `func_4`, which computes the desired \( x \).

Given the detailed analysis, all functions work together to solve the problem correctly. The logic in each function is sound, and the overall approach of using a combination of tree traversal and binary search is appropriate for finding the maximum \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
