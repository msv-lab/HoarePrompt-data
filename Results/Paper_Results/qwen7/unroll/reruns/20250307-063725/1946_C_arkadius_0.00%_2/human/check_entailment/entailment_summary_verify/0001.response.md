### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summaries. We'll focus on the correctness of the implementation and ensure that all aspects of the problem are addressed.

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling:**
   - The `func_5` function correctly reads the input and constructs the tree using the `add_edge` method.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is assumed to be correctly implemented, which roots the tree at vertex 0.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size (`func_4`):**
   - The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct. It uses `func_3` to determine the validity of the midpoint value `x`.
   - The search range is correctly updated based on the result of `func_3`.

3. **Checking Validity of `x` (`func_3`):**
   - The `func_3` function uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges.
   - `func_1` performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - The `postorder` flag is used to distinguish between the initial push and the final pop of each vertex.

4. **Post-order Traversal and Component Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - The `func_1` function uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex based on the children's attributes.
   - The `postorder` flag is used to ensure the correct order of operations during the traversal.

5. **Recursive Calculation of Good Components and Remaining Size (`func_2`):**
   - The `func_2` function is a helper function for `func_1` and is used to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It traverses the children of each vertex and updates the attributes accordingly.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
  - The tree is correctly constructed and rooted using the provided input.
  - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is assumed to be correctly implemented.

- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct. It uses `func_3` to determine the validity of the midpoint value `x`.
  - The search range is correctly updated based on the result of `func_3`.

- **Component Calculation:**
  - The post-order traversal in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size.
  - The recursive calculation in `func_2` is consistent with the post-order traversal logic.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0, which means no edges are removed, and the entire tree is one component.
  - The program also handles cases where the tree is split into multiple components, ensuring that each component meets the size requirement.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses a combination of binary search and post-order traversal to find the maximum component size `x` that satisfies the given conditions.
