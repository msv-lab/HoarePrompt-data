The function `func_3` accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`. It first calls another function `func_1` to determine the number of good connected components (`good_components`) and their total size (`remaining_size`) after removing `k` edges from the tree. Based on the values of `good_components` and `remaining_size`, the function returns either `True` or `False`. Specifically, it returns `True` if the number of good connected components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good connected components equals `k` and their total size is at least `x`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
