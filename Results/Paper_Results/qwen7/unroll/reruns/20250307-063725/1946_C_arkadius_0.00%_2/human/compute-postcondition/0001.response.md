Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ k < n â‰¤ 10^5, `k` is an integer, and `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `Tree` object with `n` nodes. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, but now there is an additional variable `tree` which is a `Tree` object with `n` nodes.
