The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `x`. `tree` is a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices, where `n` and `k` are integers such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`, and `x` is an integer representing the size of the connected components after removing `k` edges.

The function has three possible return values:
- Case_1: The program returns True
- Case_2: The program returns True
- Case_3: The program returns False

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`. It then checks certain conditions related to the connected components of the tree after removing `k` edges and returns either True or False based on those conditions.
