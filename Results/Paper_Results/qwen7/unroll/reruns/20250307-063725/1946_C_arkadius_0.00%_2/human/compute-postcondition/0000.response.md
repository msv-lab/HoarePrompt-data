Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer, and both `n` and `k` are the result of splitting the input string using `map(int, input().split())`.**

In this output state, the initial values of `n` and `k` are updated to their respective integer values obtained from the input. The precondition that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5` remains valid, and the function `func_4` is now ready to be called with these values to compute the maximum number `x` as described.
