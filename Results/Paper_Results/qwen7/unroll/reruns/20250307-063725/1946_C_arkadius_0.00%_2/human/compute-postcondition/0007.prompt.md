You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The input describes a tree with n vertices, where each of the n-1 lines represents an edge connecting two vertices u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). The function `func_4` is expected to compute and return the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `k` edges added, connecting nodes based on user input during each iteration of the loop. Each edge connects two nodes, where the nodes are zero-indexed integers ranging from 0 to `n-1`.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: func_4(tree, n, k) (where `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `k` edges, `n` is the number of nodes, and `k` is the number of edges added)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a tree described by its vertices and edges. It computes and returns the maximum number x such that by removing exactly k edges from the tree, the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
