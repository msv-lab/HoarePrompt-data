### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly initializes a tree structure using the `Tree` class, which includes methods to add edges and root the tree.
   - The tree is constructed correctly from the input edges, and the tree is rooted at node 0 using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`).

2. **Post-order Traversal and Component Calculation**:
   - Function `func_1` performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component.
   - This function correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each node based on the sizes of its children.

3. **Recursive Calculation of Components**:
   - Function `func_2` recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree.
   - This function is used within `func_1` to ensure that the calculations are consistent and accurate.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum x**:
   - Function `func_3` uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and still have each remaining connected component of size at least `x`.
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, with `func_1` being called to check if a given `x` is feasible.

5. **Main Function Execution**:
   - Function `func_4` implements the binary search algorithm to find the maximum `x`.
   - The main function `func_5` reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to compute the desired value of `x`.

Given the detailed breakdown, the program appears to follow the correct logic and structure to solve the problem as described. All functions are interconnected and perform their respective tasks accurately.
