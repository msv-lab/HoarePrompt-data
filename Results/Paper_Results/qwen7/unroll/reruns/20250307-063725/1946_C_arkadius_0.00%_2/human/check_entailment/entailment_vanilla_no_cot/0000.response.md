To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and correctness of each function, especially focusing on how they handle the problem constraints and requirements.

### Analysis:

1. **Tree Class and Methods**:
   - The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) are assumed to be correctly implemented elsewhere in the code, as they are not provided here.
   - The `func_1` and `func_2` functions seem to be incorrectly named and their purpose is not clear from the context. They appear to be trying to traverse the tree and calculate something, but their implementation does not align with the problem statement.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum value of `x`. This is a good approach as it efficiently narrows down the possible values of `x`.
   - `func_3` is supposed to check if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. However, the current implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` seems to be incorrect and does not serve the intended purpose.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - `func_2` is a recursive function that should calculate the number of good components and the remaining size. However, the logic inside `func_2` is flawed and does not correctly implement the required functionality.

### Conclusion:

Given the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not correctly designed to achieve the desired outcome. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
