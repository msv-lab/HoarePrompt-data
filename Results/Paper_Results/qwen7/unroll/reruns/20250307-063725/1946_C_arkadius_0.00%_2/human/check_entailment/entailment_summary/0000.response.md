Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function performs a post-order traversal to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex. It checks if the remaining size of each subtree is at least \( x \) and updates the `good_components` accordingly.
   - **func_2**: This function recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree. It is used internally by `func_1`.
   - **func_3**: This function uses `func_1` to check if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the number of good components equals \( k \) and their total size is at least \( x \).
   - **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the smallest \( x \) such that `func_3` returns `False` when called with \( x \). This effectively finds the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the condition.
   - **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and then calls `func_4` to compute and print the result.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The functions collectively perform the necessary steps to solve the problem:
     - Construct the tree.
     - Root the tree to facilitate traversal.
     - Use post-order traversal to update the required attributes.
     - Perform binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The logic in `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` correctly updates and checks the conditions for good components and remaining sizes.
   - The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the correct \( x \) is found efficiently.

Given that all functions work together to correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
