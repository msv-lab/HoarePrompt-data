Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `k` edges added, connecting nodes based on user input during each iteration of the loop, and the tree has been rooted non-recursively at node 0 with its parent set to -1.**

Explanation: The method `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` roots the tree non-recursively at node 0, setting its parent to -1. This does not change the number of nodes (`n`) or edges (`k`), nor does it affect any other variables. The tree's structure is updated to reflect the root node and its parent relationship.
