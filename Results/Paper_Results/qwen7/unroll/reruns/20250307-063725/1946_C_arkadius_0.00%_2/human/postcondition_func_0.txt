The function `func_1` takes a `Tree` object, a starting vertex `s`, and an integer `x` as inputs. It performs a post-order traversal of the tree to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex. After processing all vertices, it returns a tuple containing the number of good components for the starting vertex `s` and the remaining size of the component rooted at `s`. A good component is defined as a connected component, including itself, that has a remaining size of at least `x` after removing exactly `k` edges from the tree.
