The function processes a tree structure to count the number of good components and calculate the remaining size. A good component is defined as a subtree where the remaining size (number of vertices) is greater than or equal to the given minimum size \( x \). The function returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of such good components, and `remaining_size`, which is the cumulative size of all subtrees.
