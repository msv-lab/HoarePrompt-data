The function `func_3` accepts four parameters: `tree` (a Tree object representing a tree with `n` vertices), `n` (an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree), `k` (an integer such that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5`), and `x` (an integer representing the size of the connected components after removing `k` edges). 

The function has three possible return values:
- Case_1: Returns `True`
- Case_2: Returns `True`
- Case_3: Returns `False`

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a tree object, along with integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and return `True` under two specific conditions and `False` in the third condition.
