n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The input describes a tree with n vertices, where each of the n-1 lines represents an edge connecting two vertices u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n). The function `func_4` is expected to compute and return the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.
