Given the initial state where `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `k` edges added, and the tree has been rooted non-recursively at node 0 with its parent set to -1, we need to determine what `func_4(tree, n, k)` returns and then print it.

However, the function `func_4` itself is not defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value of `func_4(tree, n, k)` without knowing its implementation. 

Based on the available information, we can only describe the parameters passed to the function:

- `tree`: A Tree object with `n` nodes and `k` edges.
- `n`: An integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `k`: An integer representing the number of edges added to the tree.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_4`, we cannot provide a specific value for what will be printed. We can only state that the function will be called with these parameters and its return value will be printed.

Output: **func_4(tree, n, k) (where `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `k` edges, `n` is the number of nodes, and `k` is the number of edges added)**
