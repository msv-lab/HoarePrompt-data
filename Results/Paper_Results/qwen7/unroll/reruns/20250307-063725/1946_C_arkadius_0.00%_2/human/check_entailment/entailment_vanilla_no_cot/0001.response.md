Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The function `func_4` performs a binary search on the possible values of \( x \). It uses `func_3` to check if a given \( x \) is feasible.
   - The initial range for \( x \) is from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Feasibility Check Function (`func_3`)**:
   - `func_3` uses `func_1` to determine the number of good components (components with at least \( x \) vertices) and the total remaining size of these components.
   - `func_1` performs a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and update the counts.

4. **DFS Function (`func_1`)**:
   - `func_1` updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes.
   - It uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all child components are processed before updating the parent node.

5. **Helper DFS Function (`func_2`)**:
   - `func_2` is a helper function used within `func_1` to recursively process the children of a node.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes similarly to `func_1`.

6. **Tree Structure**:
   - The `Tree` class seems to be defined elsewhere but is assumed to have methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and attributes like `vertices`.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to set the root of the tree, which is necessary for the DFS traversal.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Binary Search (`func_4`)**:
  - The binary search correctly narrows down the value of \( x \) using the feasibility check from `func_3`.
  - The search range is properly initialized and updated based on the results of `func_3`.

- **DFS Traversal (`func_1` and `func_2`)**:
  - The DFS traversal correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes.
  - The post-order traversal ensures that all child components are processed before updating the parent node, which is crucial for the correct calculation of `remaining_size`.

- **Tree Construction**:
  - The tree is constructed correctly from the input edges.
  - The root of the tree is set appropriately using `root_tree_non_recursive`.

### Conclusion

The given program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The binary search, DFS traversal, and tree construction all seem to be implemented correctly based on the problem description.
