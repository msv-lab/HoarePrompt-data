Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Tree Representation and Input Handling:**
   - The program uses a `Tree` class to represent the tree structure.
   - The `func_5` function reads the input and constructs the tree using the `add_edge` method.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is called to root the tree at vertex 0 (this method is not defined in the provided code, but it is assumed to be implemented elsewhere).

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size (`func_4`):**
   - The binary search is used to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining connected component of size at least `x`.
   - The `beg` and `end` variables are initialized to 1 and `n` respectively, representing the range of possible values for `x`.
   - The `mid` value is calculated as `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and the `func_3` function is used to check if `mid` is a valid value for `x`.

3. **Checking Validity of `x` (`func_3`):**
   - The `func_3` function uses `func_1` to compute the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges.
   - `func_1` performs a post-order traversal of the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - If the number of good components is greater than `k`, or if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, then `func_3` returns `True`.

4. **Post-order Traversal and Component Calculation (`func_1`):**
   - The `func_1` function uses a stack to perform a post-order traversal.
   - It updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of each vertex based on the children's attributes.
   - The `postorder` flag is used to distinguish between the initial push and the final pop of each vertex.

5. **Recursive Calculation of Good Components and Remaining Size (`func_2`):**
   - The `func_2` function is a helper function for `func_1` and is used to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - It traverses the children of each vertex and updates the attributes accordingly.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Tree Construction and Rooting:** 
  - The tree is correctly constructed and rooted using the provided input.
  - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is assumed to be correctly implemented.

- **Binary Search Implementation:**
  - The binary search logic in `func_4` is correct. It uses `func_3` to determine the validity of the midpoint value `x`.
  - The search range is correctly updated based on the result of `func_3`.

- **Component Calculation:**
  - The post-order traversal in `func_1` correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size.
  - The recursive calculation in `func_2` is consistent with the post-order traversal logic.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles the edge case where `k` is 0, which would mean no edges are removed, and the entire tree is one component.
  - The program also handles cases where the tree is split into multiple components, ensuring that each component meets the size requirement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses a combination of binary search and post-order traversal to find the maximum component size `x` that satisfies the given conditions.
