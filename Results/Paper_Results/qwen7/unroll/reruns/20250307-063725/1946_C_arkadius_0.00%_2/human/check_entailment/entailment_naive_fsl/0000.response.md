Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \). 

Here are a few issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Size and Good Components**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly calculate the remaining size and good components. Specifically, the logic for updating `remaining_size` and `good_components` is flawed. For example, when a subtree's remaining size is less than \( x \), it should not simply add the subtree's remaining size to the parent's remaining size but rather ensure that the parent's remaining size is at least \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The function `func_4` uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). However, the binary search is not correctly implemented. The condition `if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):` should check if it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least \( mid \) vertices. The current implementation does not properly handle the edge cases and may not converge to the correct value of \( x \).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:
- \( n = 5 \)
- \( k = 1 \)
- Edges: \( (1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5) \)

The correct answer should be 2, as removing the edge between 1 and 3 results in two components: {1, 2} and {3, 4, 5}. However, the provided code might fail to correctly identify this scenario due to the flawed logic in calculating the remaining sizes and good components.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
