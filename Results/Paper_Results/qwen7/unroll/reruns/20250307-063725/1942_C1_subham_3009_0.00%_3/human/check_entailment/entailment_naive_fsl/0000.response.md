Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem, Bessie needs to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices. However, the program simply prints `x - 2`, which is incorrect because it does not consider the value of `y` or the total number of vertices `n`.

A correct approach would involve calculating the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and potentially adding more vertices to maximize the number of triangles. The current implementation does not account for these factors and thus fails to meet the problem's requirements.
