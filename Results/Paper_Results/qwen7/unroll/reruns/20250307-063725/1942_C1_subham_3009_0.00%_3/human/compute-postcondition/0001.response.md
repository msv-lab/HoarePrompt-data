Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4` remains valid after the execution of this line of code. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
