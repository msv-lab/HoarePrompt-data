Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \)). For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \) (with \( y \) fixed at 0), and an array of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). The function then prints the value \( x - 2 \) for each test case, resulting in \( t \) lines of output, each containing a single integer.**
