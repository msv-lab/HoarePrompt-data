Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, x, and y (with y fixed at 0). The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and process them according to the given constraints.
