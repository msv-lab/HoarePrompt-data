You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a single integer value which is the result of `x - 2` for each iteration of the loop.
        #
        #Explanation: In each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1, and then the code reads three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`) from input and an array of integers. It then prints `x - 2`. Since the value of `t` is used as the condition to continue the loop, once `t` becomes 0, the loop stops. Therefore, the number of times the loop runs is equal to the initial value of `t`. For each run, it prints `x - 2`, so the final output state will be a series of these values, one per line.
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each containing the value of `x - 2`, where `t` is the initial value of the integer `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes three integers n, x, and y (with y fixed at 0). The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
