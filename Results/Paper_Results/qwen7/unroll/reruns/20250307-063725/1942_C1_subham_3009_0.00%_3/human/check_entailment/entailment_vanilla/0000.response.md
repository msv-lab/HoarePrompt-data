### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a polygon. Given constraints are \( n \) (number of sides), \( x \) (number of vertices already chosen by Bessie), and \( y \) (maximum additional vertices we can choose). Here, \( y = 0 \).

2. **Key Insight**: To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices. If we have \( x \) vertices already chosen, we can form at most \( x - 2 \) triangles because each triangle uses 3 vertices and we need to ensure non-intersecting diagonals.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \).
   - It then reads the list of \( x \) chosen vertices.
   - Finally, it prints \( x - 2 \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code is correct. Given \( x \) vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is indeed \( x - 2 \).
   - The code correctly handles the constraints and outputs the expected results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where \( y = 0 \) correctly by not using any additional vertices.
   - The code correctly processes multiple test cases within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
