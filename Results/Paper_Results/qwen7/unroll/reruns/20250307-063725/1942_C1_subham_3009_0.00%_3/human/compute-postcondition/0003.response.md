Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines of "x - 2", where "x" is the value provided in the second line of each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: In each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The user inputs three integers `[n, x, y]`, followed by a list of integers `arr`. The list `arr` is then truncated to the first `x` elements. Finally, the expression `x - 2` is printed. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0. Since the exact values of `x` for each iteration are not specified, the output will be a series of results from evaluating `x - 2` for each respective `x` value provided during the iterations.
