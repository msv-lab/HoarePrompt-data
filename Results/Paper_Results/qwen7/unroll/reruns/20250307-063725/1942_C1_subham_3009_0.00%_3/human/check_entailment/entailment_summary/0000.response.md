Reasoning:
The problem requires determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the solution should involve calculating how many sets of three vertices (forming triangles) can be made from the chosen vertices.

However, the provided code simply prints `x - 2` for each test case, where `x` is the number of vertices chosen by Bessie. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming triangles using the given vertices and the additional vertices that can be chosen (which is 0 in this version of the problem).

The correct approach would be to check if the number of chosen vertices `x` is sufficient to form triangles. Since `y` is fixed at 0, we cannot add any extra vertices. Therefore, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is limited by the number of ways to choose 3 vertices from the `x` chosen vertices. However, since the problem specifies that we need non-intersecting diagonals and the simplest way to maximize the number of triangles is to ensure that every set of 3 chosen vertices forms a triangle, the correct answer should be `x - 2` if `x >= 3`.

Given the execution summary, the code is indeed printing `x - 2`, which aligns with the correct logic when `x >= 3`. Since the code matches the expected behavior and the problem constraints are correctly handled, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
