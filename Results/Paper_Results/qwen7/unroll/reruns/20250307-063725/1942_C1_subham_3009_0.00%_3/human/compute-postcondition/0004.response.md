Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a single integer value which is the result of `x - 2` for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: In each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1, and then the code reads three integers (`n`, `x`, `y`) from input and an array of integers. It then prints `x - 2`. Since the value of `t` is used as the condition to continue the loop, once `t` becomes 0, the loop stops. Therefore, the number of times the loop runs is equal to the initial value of `t`. For each run, it prints `x - 2`, so the final output state will be a series of these values, one per line.
