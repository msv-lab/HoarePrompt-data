Postcondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5. The current execution is inside the if statement block marked by __name__ == '__main__'.**
