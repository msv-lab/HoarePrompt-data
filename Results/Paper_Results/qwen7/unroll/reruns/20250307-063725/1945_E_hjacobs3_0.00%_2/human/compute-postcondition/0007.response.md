Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` converted to a string, and the second string is the index of `find` in `array` converted to a string and incremented by 1.**

This means the program returns a list with two elements:
1. The first element is `l + 1` as a string.
2. The second element is the index of `find` in `array` (as determined by `array.index(find)`) incremented by 1 and converted to a string.
