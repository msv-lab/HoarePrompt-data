### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the first element `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the given permutation `array` to find the position of `x`.
- If `x` is found, it returns a list with two strings: the index of `x` incremented by 1.
- If `x` is not found, it returns a list with "1" and the index where `x` would be inserted to maintain the order, both incremented by 1.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is implemented correctly. It finds the position where `x` should be placed if it were not in the permutation.
   - If `array[mid] >= find`, it adjusts the right boundary `r`.
   - If `array[mid] < find`, it adjusts the left boundary `l`.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function currently does not perform any swaps if `x` is not found.
   - This means that if `x` is not in the permutation, the function will return `0` without making any changes to the array.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case mentioned in the original assessment:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  4 5
  2 6
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

The provided program does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation. According to the problem statement, we need to rearrange the numbers such that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The function summary indicates that the function should return the necessary swaps to achieve this, but the current implementation does not do so.

#### Correctness of the Program:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation.
- It should return the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` equals `x`.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as it does not perform the necessary swaps when `x` is not present in the permutation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
