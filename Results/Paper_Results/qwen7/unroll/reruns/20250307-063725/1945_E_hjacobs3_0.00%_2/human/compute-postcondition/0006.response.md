Output: **1**

Explanation: The initial state does not provide any specific values for `l`, `r`, or `array`. It only states that `l` is greater than `r` and `l` is not the index of `find` in `array`. The `print` statement simply outputs the integer `1` regardless of the values of `l` and `r`. Therefore, the output will be `1`.
