Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. Since `n` is the length of the array, `n - 1` is the index of the last element in the array.
   - The condition `l <= r` will be true as long as `r` is greater than or equal to `l`.

4. **Check if any adjustment is needed**:
   - `l` is already 0, which satisfies the left part of the condition.
   - `r` is `n - 1`, and since `n` is the length of the array, `n - 1` is always a valid index for the array.

Given that both `l` and `r` are set correctly and the condition `l <= r` is satisfied, no adjustments are needed.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1**
