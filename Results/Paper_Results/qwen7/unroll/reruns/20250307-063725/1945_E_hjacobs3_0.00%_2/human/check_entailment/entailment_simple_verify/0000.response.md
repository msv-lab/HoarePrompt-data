### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing the binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
   - The binary search should be performed on a sorted version of the permutation, but since the permutation is not sorted, we can make at most 2 swaps to achieve the desired result.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The `func_1` function performs a binary search on the given permutation `array` to find the position `l` where `array[l]` is just greater than `x`.
   - The function then checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the permutation.
     - If `l` is not equal to the index of `x`, it prints `1` and returns the indices `[l + 1, array.index(find) + 1]`.
     - If `l` is equal to the index of `x`, it prints `0` and returns nothing.

3. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the `func_1` function.
   - However, the function does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation. It assumes that `x` is always present and tries to find its position using binary search.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     1
     6 3
     4 3 1 5 2 6
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     2
     4 5
     2 6
     ```
   - The provided code will output:
     ```
     0
     ```
   - This is because the function does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation and does not perform the necessary swaps.

5. **Correctness of the Function**:
   - The function does not correctly implement the requirement to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after performing the binary search.
   - The function only checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` and performs swaps if necessary. However, it does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the swaps.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality because it does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation and does not ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation and does not ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after the swaps.
