Output State: `l` is greater than `r`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. In each iteration, the value of `mid` is calculated as the floor division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. Depending on whether `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, either `r` is updated to `mid - 1` or `l` is updated to `mid + 1`. This process narrows down the search range until `l` becomes greater than `r`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `l` will be the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than `find`, or `l` will be 0 if `find` is greater than all elements in the array.
