Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the permutation. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, the current implementation only checks if `array[mid] >= find` and adjusts the search range accordingly. If `x` is not in the permutation, the function will incorrectly return without making any swaps, which does not meet the requirement of ensuring `p_l` equals `x`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

Expected output:
```
2
4 5
2 6
```

However, the provided program will output:
```
0
```

This is because the program does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation, and it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` equals `x`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
