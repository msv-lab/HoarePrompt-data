Output State: `l` is greater than `r`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, we calculate `mid` as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r` by 2. Depending on whether `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`, we adjust either `l` to `mid + 1` or `r` to `mid - 1`. This process narrows down the search range until `l` becomes greater than `r`, at which point the loop terminates. At this point, `l` will be the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than `find`, or `n` if no such element exists.
