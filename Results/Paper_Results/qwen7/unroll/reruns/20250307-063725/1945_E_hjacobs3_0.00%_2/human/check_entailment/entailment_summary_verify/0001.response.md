### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the given function summary.

1. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` starts with `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`. This is indeed incorrect because the problem specifies 1-based indexing. However, the function summary indicates that the function handles 1-based indexing internally, which means the binary search logic should work correctly with the given 0-based array indices.

2. **Finding the Correct Position**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search to find the position where `find` should be inserted to maintain the order. This is correct. If `find` is not present in the array, the function returns the index where `find` would be inserted, incremented by 1.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function checks if the element at `array[mid]` is equal to `find`. If not, it returns the indices `[str(mid + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]`. This logic is flawed because it assumes that the element at `array[mid]` is not already in the correct position, which is not necessarily true. The function should ensure that the element at `array[mid]` is swapped with `find` only if it is not already in the correct position.

4. **Ensuring Correct Final Arrangement**:
   - The function does not explicitly ensure that the swaps are made in such a way that the final position of `find` is correct. It only prints the index of the element to be swapped with `find` if they are not already in the correct position, which is not sufficient to guarantee the correct final arrangement. The function should ensure that the correct swaps are made to place `find` at its correct position.

5. **Handling the Case Where `find` is Already in the Correct Position**:
   - The function should print `0` and not perform any swaps if `find` is already in the correct position. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the element `find` is already in the correct position, and it does not ensure that the swaps are made in such a way that the final position of `find` is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.
