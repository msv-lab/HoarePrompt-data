Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps to ensure that the binary search will correctly identify the position of `x` as `p_l`.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by performing a binary search and checking if the result of the search matches the expected position of `x`. If it doesn't match, it performs a swap to correct the position.
3. However, the implementation of the binary search is flawed. The initial values of `l` and `r` are set incorrectly (`l = 0` and `r = n - 1`). These should be set to `1` and `n` respectively, as per the problem statement.
4. Additionally, the logic inside the binary search loop is incorrect. The condition `array[mid] >= find` should be `array[mid] > find` because the search is looking for the smallest index where `array[mid]` is greater than `find`.
5. The function `func_1` only handles the case where `l` is not equal to the index of `find`. It does not handle the case where `l` is already correct, which means the binary search has already found the correct position.
6. The solution also does not account for the possibility of needing exactly 2 swaps, as required by the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
