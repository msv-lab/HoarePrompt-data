Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The main issue lies in how the binary search is used and the logic for determining the necessary swaps.
2. The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array to find the position where `find` should be inserted. However, it does not correctly handle the case where the element `find` is not present in the array.
3. The binary search in `func_1` is implemented incorrectly. It should start with `l = 1` and `r = n`, not `l = 0` and `r = n - 1`. This is because the indices in the array are 0-based, but the problem specifies 1-based indexing.
4. After finding the position `mid` where `find` should be inserted, the function should check if the element at `array[mid]` is equal to `find`. If not, it should swap the elements at `mid` and `array.index(find)` only if `array[mid]` is not already equal to `find`.
5. The program does not ensure that the swaps are made in such a way that the final position of `find` is correct. It only prints the index of the element to be swapped with `find` if they are not already in the correct position, which is not sufficient to guarantee the correct final arrangement.
6. The program does not handle the case where the element `find` is already in the correct position, which means it should print `0` and not perform any swaps.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
