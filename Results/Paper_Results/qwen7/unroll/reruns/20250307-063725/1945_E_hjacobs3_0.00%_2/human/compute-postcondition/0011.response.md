Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers (`array`) representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer (`find`) such that `1 <= find <= n`. It performs a binary search to find the position of `find` in `array`. If `find` is present in `array`, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` in `array` incremented by 1, and the second string is the same index incremented by 1. If `find` is not present, it returns a list containing two strings: "1" and the index where `find` would be inserted to maintain the order, both incremented by 1.**
