Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation array using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm will correctly identify the position of the target number \(x\). The binary search algorithm should end with \(p_l = x\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation \(n\) and the target number \(x\).
   - It then reads the permutation array and calls the function `func_1(array, find)` to determine the necessary swaps.
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search-like operation to find the position of \(x\) in the array. However, the implementation of the binary search is incorrect and does not ensure that the array is sorted before performing the search.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and \(n-1\) respectively.
   - It performs a binary search-like operation but does not sort the array. Instead, it directly checks if the middle element is greater than or equal to \(x\) and adjusts the search range accordingly.
   - After the loop, it checks if the target \(x\) is found at the index `l`. If not, it prints 1 and returns the indices of the first occurrence of `x` and the current `l`.

4. **Issues Identified**:
   - The binary search-like operation in `func_1` does not guarantee that the array is sorted. Therefore, the binary search may not work correctly unless the array is already sorted.
   - The function does not handle the case where the array is not sorted and needs to be sorted with at most 2 swaps.
   - The logic to determine the necessary swaps is flawed and does not ensure that the array is correctly rearranged for the binary search to work.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. It does not ensure that the array is sorted or rearranged properly before performing the binary search.

Correctness: **False**
