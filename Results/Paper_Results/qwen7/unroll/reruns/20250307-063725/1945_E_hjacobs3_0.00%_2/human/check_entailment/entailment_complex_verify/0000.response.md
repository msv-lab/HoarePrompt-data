### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function performs a binary search on the array `array` to find the position of `find`.
   - After the binary search loop, it checks if `l` (which is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than `find`) is different from the index of `find` in the array.
   - If `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns a list with the indices of the swap needed to place `find` at the correct position.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `find`, it prints `0` and returns an empty list.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `l` is greater than `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the midpoint `mid` and adjusts the search range based on whether `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find`.
   - When the loop exits, `l` is the smallest index such that `array[l]` is greater than `find`.

3. **Handling Missing Elements**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `find` is not present in the permutation. In such cases, the function will return `0` without performing any swaps.
   - However, the problem statement requires us to rearrange the numbers in the permutation such that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. This means we need to ensure that `array[l]` is equal to `find` after the swaps.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To ensure `array[l]` is equal to `find`, we need to swap `array[l]` with `find` if `find` is not already at the correct position.
   - We can achieve this by performing the following steps:
     1. Perform the binary search to find the position `l`.
     2. Check if `array[l]` is equal to `find`.
     3. If not, swap `array[l]` with `find` and return the indices of the swap.

5. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     1
     6 3
     4 3 1 5 2 6
     ```
   - The expected output is:
     ```
     2
     4 5
     2 6
     ```
   - The provided program outputs:
     ```
     0
     ```
   - This is incorrect because the function does not handle the case where `find` is not present in the permutation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. It fails to handle the case where `find` is not present in the permutation and does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` equals `x`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
