Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a list of ranks sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order where for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, an answer string is appended to `answers` using the highest rank of that suit and the remaining elements of `trumps`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
