Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly identifies the trump suit and the 2n cards.
3. The function handles the trump cards appropriately, ensuring that a card can beat any non-trump card and that a trump card can only be beaten by a higher-ranked trump card.
4. The function sorts the suits and ranks correctly to ensure that the output adheres to the rules of the game.
5. The function handles the case where there are no valid solutions by printing "IMPOSSIBLE" and returning early.
6. The overall logic of the function matches the problem description and the expected behavior.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the rules of the game and handle all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
