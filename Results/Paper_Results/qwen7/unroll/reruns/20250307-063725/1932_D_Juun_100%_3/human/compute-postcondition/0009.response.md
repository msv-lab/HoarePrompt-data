Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order where for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, an answer string is appended to `answers` using the highest rank of that suit and the remaining elements from `trumps`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None after processing the loop. If a suit in `suits` does not have a non-None value, no corresponding answer string is appended to `answers`. If `trumps` becomes empty before all suits are processed, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed and the function returns.
