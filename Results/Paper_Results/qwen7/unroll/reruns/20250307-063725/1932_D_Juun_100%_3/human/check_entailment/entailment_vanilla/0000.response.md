### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes variables for processing each test case.
   - `func_1()` is called for each test case, which handles the parsing and processing of the input.

2. **Trick Suit Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies the trump suit and processes the cards accordingly.
   - Cards of the trump suit are stored in the `trumps` list, and non-trump cards are processed to find pairs where one card beats the other.

3. **Non-Trick Card Handling**:
   - Non-trick cards are matched based on their suit. The program ensures that the card with the higher rank beats the lower-ranked card of the same suit.
   - If a suit does not have a card to match, it is noted, and the program proceeds to handle remaining cards.

4. **Trick Card Matching**:
   - If there are remaining cards in the `trumps` list, they are paired with the highest available trump card from the `trumps` list.
   - If there are no remaining cards to pair, the program prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns, indicating that no valid sequence can be formed.

5. **Remaining Trump Cards**:
   - Any remaining trump cards are paired with each other in descending order of rank.

6. **Output Generation**:
   - The program generates and prints the sequence of moves for each test case, ensuring that all cards are accounted for.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly handles the logic for identifying and pairing cards based on the rules provided.
- It appropriately handles the scenario where no valid sequence can be formed.
- The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem.

**Correctness: True**
