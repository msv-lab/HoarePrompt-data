Output State: **`trumps` is a list of ranks sorted in descending order, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order where for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, an answer string is appended to `answers` using the highest rank of that suit and the remaining elements of `trumps`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)` sorts the `trumps` list in descending order. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
