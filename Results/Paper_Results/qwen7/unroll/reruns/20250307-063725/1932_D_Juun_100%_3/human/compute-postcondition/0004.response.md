Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, trumps is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values all set to None.**

The code initializes a dictionary `suits` with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and sets all their values to `None`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, the trump suit, `trumps`, or `answers`.
