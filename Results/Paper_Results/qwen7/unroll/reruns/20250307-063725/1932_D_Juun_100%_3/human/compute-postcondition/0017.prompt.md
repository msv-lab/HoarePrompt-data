Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will execute until the `trumps` list is empty. Since the loop pops two elements from `trumps` in each iteration and prints them, the output will consist of pairs of ranks from the `trumps` list, printed in descending order, until there are no more elements left in `trumps`.

For example, if `trumps = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J']` and `trump` is some suit (e.g., '♠'), the output will be:

```
AJ ♠ AQ ♠
```

This is because the loop pops 'A' and 'K' first, then 'Q' and 'J'. The output state is a series of printed statements, each containing a pair of ranks followed by the trump suit.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
