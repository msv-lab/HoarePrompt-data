Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, trumps is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `trump suit`, or `trumps`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
