You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of strings where each string is a two-character format representing the rank and suit of a card, with all cards being unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order where for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, an answer string is appended to `answers` using the highest rank of that suit and the remaining elements of `trumps`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None. If a suit in `suits` does not have a non-None value, no corresponding answer string is added to `answers`. If `trumps` becomes empty before processing all suits, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed and the function returns.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until the `trumps` list is empty. Since the loop pops two elements from `trumps` in each iteration and prints them, the output will consist of pairs of ranks from the `trumps` list, printed in descending order, until there are no more elements left in `trumps`.
    #
    #For example, if `trumps = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J']` and `trump` is some suit (e.g., '♠'), the output will be:
    #
    #```
    #AJ ♠ AQ ♠
    #```
    #
    #This is because the loop pops 'A' and 'K' first, then 'Q' and 'J'. The output state is a series of printed statements, each containing a pair of ranks followed by the trump suit.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each element in the `answers` list, printing each element on a new line. If `answers = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J']`, the output will be:
    #
    #```
    #A
    #K
    #Q
    #J
    #```
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases internally. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit from "CDHS", and a description of 2n unique cards represented as two-character strings indicating rank and suit. The function returns information based on these inputs, which could include validation of the inputs and analysis of the card descriptions.
