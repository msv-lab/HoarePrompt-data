Functionality: **The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit from "CDHS", and a description of 2n unique cards. It identifies the highest-ranked cards for each suit, handles the trump cards, and outputs the results in a specific format. If the conditions are met, it prints pairs of ranks and suits in ascending and descending orders, along with any remaining trump cards. If the conditions cannot be satisfied, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.**
