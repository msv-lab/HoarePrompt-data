Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of cards.

2. **Trick Card Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies and stores the ranks of trick cards (cards of the trump suit).
   - It handles non-trick cards by determining which player played a higher card of the same suit and storing the results in `answers`.

3. **Reconstructing Rounds**:
   - The program attempts to reconstruct the rounds by assigning the remaining cards to the players.
   - If there are remaining trick cards, it pairs them with the highest available non-trick cards of the same suit.
   - If there are no more cards to pair, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" if the remaining cards cannot be paired according to the rules.

4. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program outputs the results in the required format, ensuring each line contains the two cards played in a round.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles cases where there might be no valid solution by printing "IMPOSSIBLE" when necessary.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the specified scenarios and constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
