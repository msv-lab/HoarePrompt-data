#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of strings where each string is a two-character format representing the rank and suit of a card, with all cards being unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)

        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list containing strings representing pairs of ranks and suits sorted in ascending order where for each suit in `suits` that has a non-None value, an answer string is appended to `answers` using the highest rank of that suit and the remaining elements of `trumps`, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values indicating the highest rank of each suit that has been encountered, all initially set to None. If a suit in `suits` does not have a non-None value, no corresponding answer string is added to `answers`. If `trumps` becomes empty before processing all suits, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed and the function returns.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until the `trumps` list is empty. Since the loop pops two elements from `trumps` in each iteration and prints them, the output will consist of pairs of ranks from the `trumps` list, printed in descending order, until there are no more elements left in `trumps`.
    #
    #For example, if `trumps = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J']` and `trump` is some suit (e.g., '♠'), the output will be:
    #
    #```
    #AJ ♠ AQ ♠
    #```
    #
    #This is because the loop pops 'A' and 'K' first, then 'Q' and 'J'. The output state is a series of printed statements, each containing a pair of ranks followed by the trump suit.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute for each element in the `answers` list, printing each element on a new line. If `answers = ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J']`, the output will be:
    #
    #```
    #A
    #K
    #Q
    #J
    #```
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit from "CDHS", and a description of 2n unique cards. It identifies the highest-ranked cards for each suit, handles the trump cards, and outputs the results in a specific format. If the conditions are met, it prints pairs of ranks and suits in ascending and descending orders, along with any remaining trump cards. If the conditions cannot be satisfied, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE". The function does not return any value but prints the results directly.
