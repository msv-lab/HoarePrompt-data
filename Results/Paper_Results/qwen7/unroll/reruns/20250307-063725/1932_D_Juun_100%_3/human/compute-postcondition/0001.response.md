Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string obtained from input, we read an input.**

The code `trump = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `trump`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the condition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 16 still holds. The trump suit is updated to the string obtained from the input.
