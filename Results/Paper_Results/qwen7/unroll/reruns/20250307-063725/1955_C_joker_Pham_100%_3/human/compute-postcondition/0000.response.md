Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remain unchanged from the initial state.
