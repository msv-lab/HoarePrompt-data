### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` followed by the durability values of the ships `a`.
   - The function `func_1` is called with these parameters, which is correct.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - The loop runs as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0.
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if `l` and `r` are the same. If they are, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the current ship at `r`. If so, it increments the count of sunk ships (`sunks`) and breaks the loop.
   - If `l` and `r` are different, it checks which ship has higher durability. Depending on which ship has higher durability, it performs the attack and updates the durability of the other ship. If the durability of the attacked ship becomes 0, it increments the count of sunk ships and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of remaining attacks `k` is exactly enough to sink one of the ships but not both.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is less than the total durability of the ships, ensuring that no ship is attacked more than necessary.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is sufficient to sink all ships.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of sunk ships, which is printed correctly by the main program.

However, there are some issues with the logic in the function `func_1`:

- **Incorrect Handling of Durability Updates**:
  - In the part of the code where `a[l] <= a[r]` and `k >= a[l] * 2`, the function updates `a[r]` by subtracting `a[l]` from it. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results if `a[l]` and `a[r]` are updated incorrectly in subsequent iterations.
  - Similarly, when `a[r] < a[l]`, the function updates `a[l]` by subtracting `a[r]` from it, which can also lead to incorrect results.

- **Break Statements**:
  - The use of `break` statements in certain conditions can cause the loop to terminate prematurely without properly handling all attacks.

- **Logic for Multiple Attacks**:
  - The logic for handling multiple attacks (e.g., `k >= a[l] * 2 - 1`) is not entirely correct. The function should ensure that the attacks are applied correctly and that the durability values are updated accurately.

### Conclusion:

While the overall structure of the program seems to be on the right track, there are logical errors in the way the durability values are updated and the attacks are handled. These issues can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
