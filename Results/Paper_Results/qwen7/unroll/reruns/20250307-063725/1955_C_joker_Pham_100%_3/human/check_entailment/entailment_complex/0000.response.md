Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining how many ships are sunk by the Kraken based on their durability and the pattern of attacks.
2. The provided code correctly implements the logic to simulate the attacks and count the sunk ships.
3. The function `func_1` uses two pointers (`l` and `r`) to iterate over the list of ship durabilities (`a`), alternating between attacking the first and last ship.
4. The logic inside the loop correctly handles the reduction of durability and the condition checks to determine when a ship sinks.
5. The function correctly handles edge cases, such as when `l` equals `r` and when `k` becomes zero before all ships can be attacked.
6. The overall structure and logic of the function match the problem description and the expected behavior.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
