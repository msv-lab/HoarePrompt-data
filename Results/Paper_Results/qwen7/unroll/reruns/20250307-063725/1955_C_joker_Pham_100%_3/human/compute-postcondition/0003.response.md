Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied.

Explanation: After the loop executes, the variable `sunks` will be updated based on the operations performed within the loop. The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it checks whether `k` is zero, if `l` equals `r`, and then proceeds with the operations involving `a[l]` and `a[r]` to modify `k` and adjust the indices `l` and `r`. Each time certain conditions are met, `sunks` is incremented. The final value of `sunks` will reflect the total number of times these conditions were satisfied during the loop's execution.
