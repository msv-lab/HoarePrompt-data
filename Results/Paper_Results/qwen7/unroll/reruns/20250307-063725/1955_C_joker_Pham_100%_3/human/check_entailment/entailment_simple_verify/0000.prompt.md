You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #
    #The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it checks several conditions:
    #
    #1. If `k` is 0, the loop breaks.
    #2. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`. If true, it increments `sunks` by 1 and breaks the loop.
    #3. It then checks whether `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`.
    #   - If true and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, it subtracts `a[l] * 2` from `k`, reduces `a[r]` by `a[l]`, and checks if `a[r]` becomes 0. If so, it increments `sunks` by 1 and decrements `r`. It also increments `sunks` by 1 and increments `l`.
    #   - If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, it increments `sunks` by 1 and breaks the loop.
    #   - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
    #4. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, similar checks are performed but with `a[l]` and `a[r]` swapped.
    #5. The loop continues until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes 0.
    #
    #After all iterations, `sunks` will be the total count of how many times the specified conditions within the loop were met, `l` and `r` will be the final indices of the list `a` after the operations, and `k` will be the remaining value after all possible operations.

    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the total number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied during the execution of the given algorithm.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the durability of the first or last ship becomes less than the required number of attacks before the Kraken moves to the next ship. Specifically, the logic for reducing the durability of the ships and determining when a ship sinks is flawed.

For example, consider the input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
The expected output is 2, but the program incorrectly outputs 3. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. Initial state: `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
2. First attack (on the first ship): `a = [0, 2, 4, 3]` (1 ship sunk)
3. Second attack (on the last ship): `a = [0, 2, 4, 2]` (2 ships sunk)
4. Third attack (on the first ship): `a = [0, 2, 4, 2]` (2 ships sunk, but the first ship already sunk, so no change)
5. Fourth attack (on the last ship): `a = [0, 2, 4, 1]` (2 ships sunk, but the last ship has 1 durability left, so it will sink in the next attack)
6. Fifth attack (on the first ship): `a = [0, 2, 4, 0]` (3 ships sunk)

However, the program incorrectly handles the reduction of the durability of the ships and the condition checks, leading to an incorrect count of sunk ships. The correct number of sunk ships should be 2, but the program outputs 3.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the reduction of durability and the condition checks for sinking ships.
