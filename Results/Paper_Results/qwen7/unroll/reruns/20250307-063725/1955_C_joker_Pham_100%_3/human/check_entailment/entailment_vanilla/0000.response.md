Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also reads the durability of the ships `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` to process the data and print the result. This is correct since the function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for processing the attacks and determining the number of sunk ships.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks until `k` becomes 0 or there are no more ships to attack.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l` and `r` are the same. If they are, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the current ship at `r`. If so, it increments the count of sunk ships (`sunks`) and breaks the loop.
   - If `l` and `r` are different, it checks which ship has higher durability. Depending on which ship has higher durability, it performs the attack and updates the durability of the other ship. If the durability of the attacked ship becomes 0, it increments the count of sunk ships and adjusts the pointers accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of remaining attacks `k` is exactly enough to sink one of the ships but not both.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is less than the total durability of the ships, ensuring that no ship is attacked more than necessary.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is sufficient to sink all ships.

5. **Output**: The function returns the number of sunk ships, which is printed correctly by the main program.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
