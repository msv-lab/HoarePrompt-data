### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` in detail to ensure its correctness.

#### Input Parsing:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`.
3. It reads the durability of the ships `a` as a list of integers.

#### Function Call:
1. The program calls `func_1(n, k, list(a))` to process the data and print the result. This is correct since the function `func_1` is defined to handle the logic for processing the attacks and determining the number of sunk ships.

#### Function Logic:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Two pointers `l` and `r` are initialized to 0 and `n - 1` respectively.
   - A counter `sunks` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of sunk ships.

2. **Loop to Simulate Attacks**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l <= r` and `k > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `l` and `r` are the same:
     - If `l == r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the ship at `r`. If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop.
   - If `l` and `r` are different, it checks which ship has higher durability:
     - If the durability of the ship at `l` is less than or equal to the durability of the ship at `r`, it performs the following actions:
       - Reduces `k` by twice the durability of the ship at `l`.
       - Decrements the durability of the ship at `r` by the durability of the ship at `l`.
       - If the durability of the ship at `r` becomes 0, it increments `sunks` and decrements `r`.
       - Increments `sunks` and moves the pointer `l` to the next ship.
     - If the durability of the ship at `r` is less than the durability of the ship at `l`, it performs similar actions but with the roles of `l` and `r` reversed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is less than the total durability of the ships, ensuring that no ship is attacked more than necessary.
   - The function correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is sufficient to sink all ships.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of sunk ships, which is printed correctly by the main program.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- The function logic correctly simulates the attacks as described in the problem statement.
- The use of two pointers `l` and `r` ensures that the Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately.
- The decrement of `k` and the updating of ship durabilities are handled correctly.
- The function correctly handles the case where a ship's durability reaches 0, causing it to be removed from further attacks.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
