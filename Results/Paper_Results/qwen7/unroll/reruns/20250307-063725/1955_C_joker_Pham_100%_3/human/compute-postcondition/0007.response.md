Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It iterates through the list `a` using two pointers, `l` and `r`, to check and satisfy certain conditions with the elements in the list. For each iteration, it reduces the value of `k` based on the elements at positions `l` and `r`. If the conditions are met, it increments a counter `sunks`. After processing all possible pairs in the list, it returns the total count of how many times the specified conditions were satisfied.**
