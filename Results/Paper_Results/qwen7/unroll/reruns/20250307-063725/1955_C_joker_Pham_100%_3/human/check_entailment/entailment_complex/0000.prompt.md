Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is an integer representing the total number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it checks several conditions:
    #
    #1. If `k` is 0, the loop breaks.
    #2. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`. If true, it increments `sunks` by 1 and breaks the loop.
    #3. It then checks whether `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`.
    #   - If true and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, it subtracts `a[l] * 2` from `k`, reduces `a[r]` by `a[l]`, and checks if `a[r]` becomes 0. If so, it increments `sunks` by 1 and decrements `r`. It also increments `sunks` by 1 and increments `l`.
    #   - If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, it increments `sunks` by 1 and breaks the loop.
    #   - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
    #4. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, similar checks are performed but with `a[l]` and `a[r]` swapped.
    #5. The loop continues until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes 0.
    #
    #After all iterations, `sunks` will be the total count of how many times the specified conditions within the loop were met, `l` and `r` will be the final indices of the list `a` after the operations, and `k` will be the remaining value after all possible operations.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the total number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied during the execution of the given algorithm.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It iterates through the list `a` using two pointers, `l` and `r`, to check and satisfy certain conditions with the elements in the list. For each iteration, it reduces the value of `k` based on the elements at positions `l` and `r`. If the conditions are met, it increments a counter `sunks`. After processing all possible pairs in the list, it returns the total count of how many times the specified conditions were satisfied.
