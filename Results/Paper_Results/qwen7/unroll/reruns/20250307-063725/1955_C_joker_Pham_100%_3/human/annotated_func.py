    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `sunks` is an integer representing the total number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `k` is greater than 0. Inside the loop, it checks several conditions:
    #
    #1. If `k` is 0, the loop breaks.
    #2. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`. If true, it increments `sunks` by 1 and breaks the loop.
    #3. It then checks whether `a[l]` is less than or equal to `a[r]`.
    #   - If true and `k` is greater than or equal to `a[l] * 2`, it subtracts `a[l] * 2` from `k`, reduces `a[r]` by `a[l]`, and checks if `a[r]` becomes 0. If so, it increments `sunks` by 1 and decrements `r`. It also increments `sunks` by 1 and increments `l`.
    #   - If `a[l] * 2 - 1` equals `k`, it increments `sunks` by 1 and breaks the loop.
    #   - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
    #4. If `a[r]` is less than `a[l]`, similar checks are performed but with `a[l]` and `a[r]` swapped.
    #5. The loop continues until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes 0.
    #
    #After all iterations, `sunks` will be the total count of how many times the specified conditions within the loop were met, `l` and `r` will be the final indices of the list `a` after the operations, and `k` will be the remaining value after all possible operations.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the total number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied during the execution of the given algorithm.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (an integer), `k` (an integer), and `a` (a list of `n` integers). It iterates through the list `a` using two pointers, `l` and `r`, to check and satisfy certain conditions with the elements in the list. For each iteration, it reduces the value of `k` based on the elements at positions `l` and `r`. If the conditions are met, it increments a counter `sunks`. After processing all possible pairs in the list, it returns the total count of how many times the specified conditions were satisfied.
