Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of \( i \) such that \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and either \( x - n \cdot i \) is divisible by \( i \) or \( x - n \cdot \left(\frac{x}{i}\right) \) is divisible by \( \frac{x}{i} \). It then prints this maximum value for each test case.**
