You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value of \( i \) such that \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and either \( x - n \cdot i \) is divisible by \( i \) or \( x - n \cdot \left(\frac{x}{i}\right) \) is divisible by \( \frac{x}{i} \). It then prints this maximum value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.
   - The key insight here is that the GCD of the difficulties will be maximized when the difficulties are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The given solution iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, it means we can distribute the remaining difficulty evenly among the remaining sub-problems.
     - Similarly, for `x // i`, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and ensures the remaining difficulty is divisible by `x // i`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge cases where `i` and `x // i` are valid divisors.
   - It ensures that the remaining difficulty after splitting is non-negative and divisible by the chosen divisor.
   - The use of `sqrt(x)` helps in reducing the number of iterations, making the solution efficient.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum GCD is sound and covers all necessary conditions.
   - The solution handles both cases where `i` and `x // i` are valid divisors and ensures the maximum GCD is found.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
