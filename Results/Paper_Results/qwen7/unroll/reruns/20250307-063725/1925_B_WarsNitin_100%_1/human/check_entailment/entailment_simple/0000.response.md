Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n`.
3. The program aims to find the maximum GCD (balance) of `n` numbers whose sum is `x`. It does this by iterating through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
4. For each divisor `i`, it checks if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and similarly for `x // i`.
5. If these conditions are met, it updates the answer `ans` with the maximum value found.
6. The program prints the result for each test case, which is the maximum balance achievable.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
