### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.
   - The key insight here is that the GCD of the difficulties will be maximized when the difficulties are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The given solution iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, it means we can distribute the remaining difficulty evenly among the remaining sub-problems.
     - Similarly, for `x // i`, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and ensures the remaining difficulty is divisible by `x // i`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge cases where `i` and `x // i` are valid divisors.
   - It ensures that the remaining difficulty after splitting is non-negative and divisible by the chosen divisor.
   - The use of `sqrt(x)` helps in reducing the number of iterations, making the solution efficient.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to ensure the logic is correct.

   ```python
   from math import sqrt

   def func():
       for q in range(int(input())):
           x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
           
           ans = 1
           
           for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
               if x % i == 0:
                   if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                       ans = max(ans, i)
                   if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0:
                       ans = max(ans, x // i)
           
           print(ans)
   ```

   - **Initialization:** `ans` is initialized to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD.
   - **Loop through divisors:** The loop iterates from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
   - **Check divisors:** For each `i`, it checks if `i` is a divisor of `x`.
   - **First condition:** `if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0`: This checks if the remaining difficulty can be evenly divided among the remaining sub-problems.
   - **Second condition:** `if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`: This checks another way to distribute the remaining difficulty.
   - **Update answer:** `ans` is updated with the maximum GCD found.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and the annotated version, the solution appears to be correct. The logic for finding the maximum GCD is sound and covers all necessary conditions. The use of `sqrt(x)` helps in reducing the number of iterations, making the solution efficient.
