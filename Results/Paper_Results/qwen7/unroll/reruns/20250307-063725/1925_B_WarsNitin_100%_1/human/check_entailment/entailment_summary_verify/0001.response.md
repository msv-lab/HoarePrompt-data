### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.
   - The key insight here is that the GCD of the difficulties will be maximized when the difficulties are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The given solution iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, it means we can distribute the remaining difficulty evenly among the remaining sub-problems.
     - Similarly, for `x // i`, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and ensures the remaining difficulty is divisible by `x // i`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge cases where `i` and `x // i` are valid divisors.
   - It ensures that the remaining difficulty after splitting is non-negative and divisible by the chosen divisor.
   - The use of `sqrt(x)` helps in reducing the number of iterations, making the solution efficient.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum GCD is sound and covers all necessary conditions.
   - However, the function summary provided does not fully capture the nuances of the solution. Specifically, it does not mention the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and the handling of the remaining difficulty.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function Summary Inaccuracy:**
  - The function summary states that the function calculates the maximum value of \( i \) such that \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and either \( x - n \cdot i \) is divisible by \( i \) or \( x - n \cdot \left(\frac{x}{i}\right) \) is divisible by \( \frac{x}{i} \).
  - This is partially correct but misses the crucial condition `x - n * i >= 0`. Without this condition, the solution might incorrectly consider invalid splits.

- **Handling of Remaining Difficulty:**
  - The solution correctly handles the remaining difficulty by ensuring that `x - n * i` and `x - n * (x // i)` are non-negative and divisible by the respective divisors.
  - This ensures that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.

### Conclusion:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the key logic and efficiency of the solution.
- However, the function summary should include the condition `x - n * i >= 0` to accurately reflect the solution's behavior.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct, but the function summary could be more precise to fully capture the solution's behavior.
