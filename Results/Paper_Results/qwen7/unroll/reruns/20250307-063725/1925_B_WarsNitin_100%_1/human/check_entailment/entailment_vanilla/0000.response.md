### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to split the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized.
   - The key insight here is that the GCD of the difficulties will be maximized when the difficulties are as evenly distributed as possible.

2. **Approach Analysis:**
   - The given solution iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, it means we can distribute the remaining difficulty evenly among the remaining sub-problems.
     - Similarly, for `x // i`, it checks if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and ensures the remaining difficulty is divisible by `x // i`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The solution correctly handles the edge cases where `i` and `x // i` are valid divisors.
   - It ensures that the remaining difficulty after splitting is non-negative and divisible by the chosen divisor.
   - The use of `sqrt(x)` helps in reducing the number of iterations, making the solution efficient.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the maximum GCD is sound and covers all necessary conditions.
   - The solution handles both cases where `i` and `x // i` are valid divisors and ensures the maximum GCD is found.

5. **Output Validation:**
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and handles the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
