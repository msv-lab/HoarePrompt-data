Output State: **The variable `queue` will contain tuples of the form `(node, distance)`, where `node` is a node in the tree and `distance` is the shortest distance from `start` to `node`. The variable `visited` will contain all nodes that have been visited during the breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. If the `target` node is found, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.**

In more detail:
- The `queue` will consist of tuples `(node, distance)` where each `node` is a node in the tree and `distance` is the shortest distance from the `start` node to that `node`.
- The `visited` set will include all nodes that have been processed by the BFS algorithm.
- If the `target` node is found during the BFS traversal, the variable `dist` will store the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is not found, the loop will terminate without setting `dist`, and `dist` will remain as the last value it was assigned before the loop started.
