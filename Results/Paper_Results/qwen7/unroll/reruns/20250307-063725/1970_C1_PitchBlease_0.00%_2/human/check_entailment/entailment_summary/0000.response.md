Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the winner of a game played on a special tree structure with exactly two leaves. The game involves alternating moves between Ron and Hermione, with the player who cannot make a move losing.
2. The solution uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to calculate the shortest distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves.
3. The logic of the `func_1` function is correct:
   - It constructs the tree representation from the given edges.
   - It identifies the two leaves of the tree.
   - It calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using BFS.
   - It determines the winner based on whether these distances are even or odd:
     - If at least one of the distances is even, Ron wins.
     - If both distances are odd, Hermione wins.
4. The BFS implementation in `func_2` correctly finds the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution should work correctly for all valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
