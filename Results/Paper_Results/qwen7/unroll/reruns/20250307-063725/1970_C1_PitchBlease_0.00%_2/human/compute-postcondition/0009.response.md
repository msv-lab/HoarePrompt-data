Postcondition: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key representing a node in the tree and its value being a list of nodes connected to it by an edge; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection in the tree; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` calculated using BFS; `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` calculated using BFS; and both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd numbers.
