You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. The tree has exactly two leaves, and n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key representing a node in the tree and its value being a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The `n` and `start` variables remain unchanged, with `n` still representing the number of nodes in the tree and `start` still representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges`, which is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. The tree has exactly two leaves, and `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on certain conditions related to the tree structure and the starting node.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'Ron'

Case_2: The program returns the string 'Hermione'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
