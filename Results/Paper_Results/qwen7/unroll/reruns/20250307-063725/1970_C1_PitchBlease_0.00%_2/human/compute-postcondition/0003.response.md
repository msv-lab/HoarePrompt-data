Output State: The `queue` is an empty deque, `start` remains as the initial starting node, `target` remains as one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing all nodes that were visited during the traversal, including the `start` node and all nodes that are connected to it through the shortest path to the `target`.

This means that after the loop completes, the `queue` is empty because all nodes have been processed. The `start` and `target` remain unchanged as they are initial conditions. The `visited` set contains all nodes that were part of the shortest path from `start` to `target`, ensuring no node was visited more than once.
