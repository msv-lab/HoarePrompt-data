The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `queue` being non-empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing a tuple `(start, 0)`. Since the `queue` is non-empty, the loop can execute without any adjustments.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (start, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
