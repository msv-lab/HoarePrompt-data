Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, which is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges`, which is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; and `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. The tree has exactly two leaves, and `n` satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on certain conditions related to the tree structure and the starting node.**
