Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing a tuple (start, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree.**

Explanation: The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. This tuple represents the starting node (`start`) and the distance from the start node to itself, which is 0. The variables `start` and `target` remain unchanged from their initial state.
