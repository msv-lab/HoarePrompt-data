The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers, representing the starting node and one of the two leaves of a tree, respectively. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node is found, it returns the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node is not found, it returns -1.
