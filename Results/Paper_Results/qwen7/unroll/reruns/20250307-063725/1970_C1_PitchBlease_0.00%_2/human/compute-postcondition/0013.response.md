Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node where the stone is initially placed). It constructs a tree representation using the given edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using BFS. Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.**
