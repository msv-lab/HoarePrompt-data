#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. The tree has exactly two leaves, and n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, with each key representing a node in the tree and its value being a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The `n` and `start` variables remain unchanged, with `n` still representing the number of nodes in the tree and `start` still representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns the string 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (the starting node where the stone is initially placed). It constructs a tree representation using the given edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using BFS. Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node, and target is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree. Both start and target are within the range 1 <= start, target <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The variable tree is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where tree[i] is a list of integers representing the neighbors of node i.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: The variable `queue` will contain tuples of the form `(node, distance)`, where `node` is a node in the tree and `distance` is the shortest distance from `start` to `node`. The variable `visited` will contain all nodes that have been visited during the breadth-first search (BFS) traversal. If the `target` node is found, `dist` will hold the shortest distance from `start` to `target`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers, representing the starting node and one of the two leaves of a tree, respectively. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node is found, it returns the shortest distance from `start` to `target`. If the `target` node is not found, it returns -1.
