You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: idx is 1, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and permutation is a list where each index that is a multiple of (i + k) for i in range(k) is filled with values from 1 to n in sequence, with the rest of the elements remaining as 0. curr_v is n + 1.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: - The `print(result)` statement will output the string representation of the `permutation` list.
    #
    #Given the initial state and the construction of the `permutation` list, the output will be a space-separated string of integers representing the `permutation` list.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It returns an error message if k is not even or if the conditions 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 are not met; otherwise, it returns nothing.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
