You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: idx is 1, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and permutation is a list where each index that is a multiple of (i + k) for i in range(k) is filled with values from 1 to n in sequence, with the rest of the elements remaining as 0. curr_v is n + 1.

    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It constructs a list `permutation` of length \( n \), filling specific indices based on the value of \( k \). Each index that is a multiple of \( (i + k) \) for \( i \) in the range of \( k \) is filled with consecutive integers starting from 1. All other indices remain 0. Finally, it prints the resulting list as a space-separated string. If the conditions on \( n \) and \( k \) are not met, the function will not execute correctly, leading to undefined behavior.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even), then calls another function `func_1()` to process these values. After processing all test cases, it sets `t` to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`

Expected output: A valid 2-level permutation could be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` because the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are `1+2=3` and `3+4=7`, and the difference is `4`, which exceeds the requirement.

However, the current implementation will produce a permutation like `[1, 3, 2, 4]`:
- Sum of the first segment: `1 + 3 = 4`
- Sum of the second segment: `3 + 2 = 5`
- Sum of the third segment: `2 + 4 = 6`

Here, the maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 4, resulting in a difference of 2, which violates the k-level condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for generating a k-level permutation for all potential cases.
