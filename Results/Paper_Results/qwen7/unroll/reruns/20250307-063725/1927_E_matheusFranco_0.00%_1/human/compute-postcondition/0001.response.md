Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**: The state right before the loop is that `t` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `t > 0` must be true. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
