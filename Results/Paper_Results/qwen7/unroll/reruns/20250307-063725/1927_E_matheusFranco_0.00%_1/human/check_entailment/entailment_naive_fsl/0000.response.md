Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `k = 2`

Expected output: A valid 2-level permutation could be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` because the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are `1+2=3` and `3+4=7`, and the difference is `4`, which exceeds the requirement.

However, the current implementation will produce a permutation like `[1, 3, 2, 4]`:
- Sum of the first segment: `1 + 3 = 4`
- Sum of the second segment: `3 + 2 = 5`
- Sum of the third segment: `2 + 4 = 6`

Here, the maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 4, resulting in a difference of 2, which violates the k-level condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for generating a k-level permutation for all potential cases.
