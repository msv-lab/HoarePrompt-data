Functionality: **The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the standard input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It constructs a list `permutation` of length \( n \), filling specific indices based on the value of \( k \). Each index that is a multiple of \( (i + k) \) for \( i \) in the range of \( k \) is filled with consecutive integers starting from 1. All other indices remain 0. Finally, it prints the resulting list as a space-separated string. If the conditions on \( n \) and \( k \) are not met, the function will not execute correctly, leading to undefined behavior.**
