Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `idx` is 1.
   - `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5.
   - `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n.
   - `permutation` is a list where each index that is a multiple of (i + k) for i in range(k) is filled with values from 1 to n in sequence, with the rest of the elements remaining as 0.
   - `curr_v` is n + 1.
   - `result` is a string representing the permutation list converted to a space-separated string of integers.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(result)
   ```

3. **Understanding `permutation`:**
   - The `permutation` list is constructed such that for each index `i` that is a multiple of `(i + k)` for `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, the value at that index is set to the next integer in the sequence starting from 1 up to `n`.
   - For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the indices that need to be filled are `2` and `4` (since `2` and `4` are multiples of `2` and `4` respectively).
   - Therefore, `permutation` would look like this: `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0]`.

4. **Constructing `result`:**
   - `result` is a string representation of the `permutation` list, with elements separated by spaces.
   - Using the example above, `result` would be `"0 1 0 2 0"`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will output the string representation of the `permutation` list.

Given the initial state and the construction of the `permutation` list, the output will be a space-separated string of integers representing the `permutation` list.

Output: **"0 1 0 2 0"** (where the exact values depend on the specific `n` and `k` but follow the pattern described)
