Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n for multiple test cases.
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` constructs a permutation based on the given conditions:
  - It initializes a list of zeros of length `n`.
  - It fills specific indices (multiples of `(i + k)` for `i` in the range of `k`) with consecutive integers starting from 1.
  - It ensures that the permutation meets the k-level condition by construction.
- Given the constraints and the nature of the construction, the permutation generated by `func_1` should inherently satisfy the k-level condition because:
  - The filled indices are evenly spaced and cover all positions in the permutation.
  - The difference between any two sums of continuous segments of length `k` will be at most 1 due to the way the indices are filled.
- Since `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`, and `func_1` generates a valid k-level permutation for each test case, the entire program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
