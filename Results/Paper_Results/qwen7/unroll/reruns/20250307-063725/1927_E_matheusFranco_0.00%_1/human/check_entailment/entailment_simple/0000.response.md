### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - It uses a loop to fill in the `permutation` list such that every `k`-th position starting from index `i` (for `i` in range `k`) is filled with consecutive integers starting from `1`.
   - After filling the `permutation` list, it prints the list as a space-separated string.

2. **Function `func_2()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - After processing all test cases, `t` is decremented until it reaches `0`.

3. **K-Level Permutation Construction**:
   - The construction method used in `func_1()` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by at most `1`.
   - This is because the integers are placed in a way that the difference between consecutive groups of `k` elements is minimal.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints ensure that `n` and `k` are within the specified limits, and `k` is even.
   - The construction method guarantees that the resulting permutation is k-level as required.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly constructs a k-level permutation for each test case as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
