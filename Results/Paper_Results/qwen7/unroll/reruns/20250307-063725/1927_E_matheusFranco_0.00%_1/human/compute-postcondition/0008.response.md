Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and `permutation` is a list where each index that is a multiple of (i + k) for i in range(k) is filled with values from 1 to n in sequence, with the rest of the elements remaining as 0; `curr_v` is n + 1; `result` is a string representing the permutation list converted to a space-separated string of integers.**

Explanation: The code creates a string `result` by joining the elements of the `permutation` list into a space-separated string of integers. This does not change the values of `idx`, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, or `curr_v`. The `permutation` list remains unchanged, and `curr_v` stays as `n + 1`. The new variable `result` is created but does not affect the initial conditions of the other variables.
