### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
   - A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
   - It initializes an array `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a loop to fill the `permutation` array in a specific pattern:
     - It starts filling the array in blocks of size `k`.
     - Each block is filled sequentially starting from 1.
     - The sequence wraps around the array, ensuring that each block is filled before moving to the next one.

3. **Checking the Pattern:**
   - Let's consider the pattern generated by `func_1` for different values of `n` and `k`:
     - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the permutation is `[1, 2]`.
     - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the permutation is `[1, 3, 2]`.
     - For `n = 10` and `k = 4`, the permutation is `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]`.

4. **Verifying the k-Level Property:**
   - For the permutation `[1, 8, 4, 10, 2, 7, 5, 9, 3, 6]` with `k = 4`:
     - Sums of segments of length 4:
       - Segment 1: \(1 + 8 + 4 + 10 = 23\)
       - Segment 2: \(8 + 4 + 10 + 2 = 24\)
       - Segment 3: \(4 + 10 + 2 + 7 = 23\)
       - Segment 4: \(10 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 24\)
       - Segment 5: \(2 + 7 + 5 + 9 = 23\)
       - Segment 6: \(7 + 5 + 9 + 3 = 24\)
       - Segment 7: \(5 + 9 + 3 + 6 = 23\)
   - The maximum sum is 24, and the minimum sum is 23. The difference is 1, satisfying the k-level condition.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_1` generates a permutation that satisfies the k-level property for the given constraints.
   - The function `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` for each test case.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the pattern generated by `func_1` does not necessarily guarantee the k-level property for all possible values of `n` and `k`. Specifically, the pattern fills the array in a way that might not ensure the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length `k` is at most 1.

For example, consider `n = 4` and `k = 2`:
- The permutation generated by `func_1` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- Sums of segments of length 2:
  - Segment 1: \(1 + 2 = 3\)
  - Segment 2: \(2 + 3 = 5\)
  - Segment 3: \(3 + 4 = 7\)
- The maximum sum is 7, and the minimum sum is 3. The difference is 4, which violates the k-level condition.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the pattern generated by `func_1` does not always satisfy the k-level property.
