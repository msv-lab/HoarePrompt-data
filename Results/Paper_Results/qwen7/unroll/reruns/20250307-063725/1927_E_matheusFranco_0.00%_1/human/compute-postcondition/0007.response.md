Output State: **idx is 1, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n, and permutation is a list where each index that is a multiple of (i + k) for i in range(k) is filled with values from 1 to n in sequence, with the rest of the elements remaining as 0. curr_v is n + 1.**
