Output State: **`t` is an input integer, indicating the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, after executing this line of code, `t` will hold the value of the input integer, which represents the number of test cases. The other conditions and constraints (such as the nature of `n` and `k` in each test case) remain unchanged for now.
