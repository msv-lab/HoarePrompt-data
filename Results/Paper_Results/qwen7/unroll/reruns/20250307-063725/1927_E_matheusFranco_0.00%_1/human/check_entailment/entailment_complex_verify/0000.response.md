### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify if it meets the requirements of constructing a k-level permutation.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function reads `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
3. **Filling the List**: It fills specific indices of the `permutation` list based on the value of `k`. Specifically, for each `i` in the range of `k`, it fills the indices that are multiples of `(i + k)` with consecutive integers starting from 1.

The key part of the function is the loop:
```python
for i in range(k):
    multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
    while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
        curr_v += 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
```

This loop ensures that every `k`-th segment of the list is filled with consecutive integers. However, the critical point is whether this approach guarantees that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**: `n = 4`, `k = 2`

The expected output is a valid 2-level permutation like `[1, 2, 3, 4]` because the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are `1+2=3` and `3+4=7`, and the difference is `4`, which exceeds the requirement.

However, the current implementation will produce a permutation like `[1, 3, 2, 4]`:
- Sum of the first segment: `1 + 3 = 4`
- Sum of the second segment: `3 + 2 = 5`
- Sum of the third segment: `2 + 4 = 6`

Here, the maximum sum is 6 and the minimum sum is 4, resulting in a difference of 2, which violates the k-level condition.

To ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, we need to carefully construct the permutation. The current approach does not guarantee this property. Instead, it simply fills the list in a way that might lead to invalid permutations.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function processes `t` test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case. Since `func_1` does not guarantee the construction of a k-level permutation, `func_2` also fails to meet the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly generate a k-level permutation for all potential cases. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
