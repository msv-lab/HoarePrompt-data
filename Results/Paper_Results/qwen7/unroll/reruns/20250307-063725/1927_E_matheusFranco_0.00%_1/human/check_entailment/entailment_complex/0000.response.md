Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length \( n \) with all elements set to 0.
   - It then fills specific indices in the `permutation` list based on the value of \( k \). Specifically, for each \( i \) in the range \( 0 \) to \( k-1 \), it sets the indices that are multiples of \( (i + k) \) to consecutive integers starting from 1.
   - The function ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length \( k \) in the constructed permutation is at most 1, making it a valid \( k \)-level permutation.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads an integer \( t \) which represents the number of test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1()`.
   - After processing all test cases, it sets \( t \) to 0.
   
3. **Overall Program Behavior**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The construction of the permutation in `func_1()` ensures that the resulting permutation meets the criteria of being a \( k \)-level permutation.
   - Given the constraints and the problem description, the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Based on the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate a \( k \)-level permutation for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
