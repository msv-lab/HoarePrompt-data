Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is an even integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `permutation` is a list where every index that is congruent to `i` modulo `k` (for `i` in range(`k`)) contains the value `i+1`, and all other indices contain `0`.

This means that for each `i` in the range `[0, k-1]`, the indices `i, i+k, i+2*k, ...` (up to but not exceeding `n-1`) will be filled with the value `i+1`. All other indices in the `permutation` list will remain `0`.
