Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even. For each test case, it does not return anything explicitly but presumably processes or calculates something based on `n` and `k`.**

Note: The exact processing or calculation is not specified in the given information, only the parameters and their constraints are provided.
