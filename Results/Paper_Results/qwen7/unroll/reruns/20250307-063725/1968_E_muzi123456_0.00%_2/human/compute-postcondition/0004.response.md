Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3. Based on these values, the function performs some unspecified operations and returns a result.**

Note: The specific operations and return value are not detailed in the given information.
