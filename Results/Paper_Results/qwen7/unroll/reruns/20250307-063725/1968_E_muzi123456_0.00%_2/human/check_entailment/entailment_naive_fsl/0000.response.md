Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases. Specifically, for \(n > 2\), the program always prints the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the number of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \(n = 3\):

- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  1 3
  ```

- The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) would be:
  \[
  \mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}
  \]
  Here, \(\mathcal{H}\) has 3 elements, but the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) can achieve \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) as shown in the problem's note.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all test cases.
