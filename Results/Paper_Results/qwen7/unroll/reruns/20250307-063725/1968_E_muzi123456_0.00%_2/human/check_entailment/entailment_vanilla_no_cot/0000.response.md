Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program prints `n` points of the form `(1, i)` for each row from 1 to `n`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances (\(\mathcal{H}\)).

To maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the points need to be strategically placed across the grid. For example, for \(n = 3\), the optimal placement would be \((2,1)\), \((2,3)\), and \((3,1)\), which results in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances compared to just placing points along a single row.

The given program should be revised to place points in a way that maximizes the distinct Manhattan distances, such as the examples provided in the problem statement.
