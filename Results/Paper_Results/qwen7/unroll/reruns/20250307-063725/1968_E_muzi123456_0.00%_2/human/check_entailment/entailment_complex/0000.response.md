Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) between pairs of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided code snippet defines a function `func()` that processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) and prints a configuration of cells in the form of \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\).
3. Let's analyze the output for different values of \(n\):
   - For \(n = 2\): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
     The Manhattan distances are \(\{|1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-2|, |1-1| + |1-2|\} = \{0, 0, 1\}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - For \(n = 3\): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
     The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 2, 1, 3\}\), and the distinct distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.
   - For \(n = 4\): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     ```
     The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1\}\), and the distinct distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 5.
   - For \(n = 5\): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 5
     ```
     The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1\}\), and the distinct distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 6.
   - For \(n = 6\): The output is:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 5
     1 6
     ```
     The Manhattan distances include \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1\}\), and the distinct distances are \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 7.

The output configuration for each \(n\) indeed maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).
