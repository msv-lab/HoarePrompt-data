Output State: The output will consist of `t` blocks, each block containing a sequence of lines. Each block starts with a line printing '1' followed by a space-separated list of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is the input provided during that iteration. After each block, there is an additional empty line.

To be more specific, if `t` is 3, the output might look like this:

```
1 1 
1 2 

1 1 
1 2 
1 3 

1 1 
1 2 
1 3 
1 4 
```

Each block corresponds to one decrement of `t`. The value of `n` is determined by user input during each iteration, and it changes with each input.
