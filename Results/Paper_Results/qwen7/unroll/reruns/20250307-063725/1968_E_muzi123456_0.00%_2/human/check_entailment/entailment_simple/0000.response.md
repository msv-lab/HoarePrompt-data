Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program iterates over \(t\) test cases. For each test case, it prints \(n\) points in the form of coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\).
3. This approach ensures that all points lie on the same row (row 1), which means the only possible Manhattan distances are those involving differences in the column indices.
4. For \(n\) points on the same row, the possible Manhattan distances are \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\). Therefore, the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(n\), which is the maximum possible for any arrangement of \(n\) points in an \(n \times n\) grid.
5. Since the program correctly outputs \(n\) points in the specified format for each test case, and the arrangement ensures the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
