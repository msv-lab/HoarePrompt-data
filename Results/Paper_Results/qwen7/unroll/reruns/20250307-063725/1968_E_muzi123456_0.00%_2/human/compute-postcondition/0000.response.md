Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, the input must still satisfy this condition. Therefore, `t` is now an input integer within the specified range. The precondition that `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 is preserved, and no other variables are affected.
