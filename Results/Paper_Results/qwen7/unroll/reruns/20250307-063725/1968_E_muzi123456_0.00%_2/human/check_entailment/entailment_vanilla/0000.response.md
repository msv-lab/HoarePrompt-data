Reasoning:
1. The task is to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program simply prints the coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(n\). This means it always outputs the cells in the first row of the grid.
3. For small values of \(n\), this approach might work because it ensures a wide range of Manhattan distances. However, for larger \(n\), this method may not necessarily produce the maximum possible set \(\mathcal{H}\).
4. To verify correctness, consider the example for \(n = 3\):
   - The program outputs: 
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - The Manhattan distances are:
     \[
     \mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1|+|1-1|, |1-1|+|2-1|, |1-1|+|3-1|, |1-2|+|1-1|, |1-2|+|2-1|, |1-2|+|3-1|, |1-3|+|1-1|, |1-3|+|2-1|, |1-3|+|3-1| \} = \{0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4\} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}
     \]
   - This set has 5 elements, which is indeed the maximum possible for \(n = 3\).
5. However, for larger \(n\), this simple approach does not guarantee the maximum set \(\mathcal{H}\). For instance, for \(n = 4\), a better arrangement could include cells like \((1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), \((4, 3)\), \((4, 4)\), which would yield a larger set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not always maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
