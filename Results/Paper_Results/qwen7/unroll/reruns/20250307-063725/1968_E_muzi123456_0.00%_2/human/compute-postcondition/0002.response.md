Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a different value of `n` provided by the user. For each line, it will first print a sequence of '1's followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces, and then a single space at the end.

To break it down further:
- The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0.
- For each iteration, the value of `t` is decremented by 1.
- The user is prompted to enter an integer `n`.
- Then, `n` lines are printed. Each line starts with `n` '1's, followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), all separated by spaces, and ends with a space.

Since the exact values of `n` entered by the user are not specified, the output will vary based on those inputs. However, the structure of the output will always follow the described pattern for each value of `n`.
