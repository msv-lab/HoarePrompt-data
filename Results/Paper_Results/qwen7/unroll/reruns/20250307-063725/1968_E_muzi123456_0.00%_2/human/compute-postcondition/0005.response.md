Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (between 2 and 10^3) and prints a block of output. Each block consists of `n` lines, starting with '1' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces. After each block, an empty line is printed. The function does not return any value.**
