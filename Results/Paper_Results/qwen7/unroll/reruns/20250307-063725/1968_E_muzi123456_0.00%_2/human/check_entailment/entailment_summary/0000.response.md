Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program generates a specific pattern for each test case: it places all the points along the main diagonal of the grid (i.e., points \((1,1), (2,2), \ldots, (n,n)\)).
3. For an \(n \times n\) grid, placing points along the main diagonal ensures that the minimum Manhattan distance is 0 (between any point and itself) and the maximum Manhattan distance is \(2(n-1)\) (between the points \((1,1)\) and \((n,n)\)).
4. The number of distinct Manhattan distances generated by this pattern is \(2n - 1\). This is because the distances range from 0 to \(2(n-1)\) and include every even and odd number in between.
5. The execution summary indicates that the program prints `n` lines for each test case, starting with '1' followed by the numbers from 1 to `n`, which matches the described pattern.
6. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the solution to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **True**
