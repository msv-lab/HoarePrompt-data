You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The function `generate` is assumed to be a generator function that yields all possible combinations of the prime factors of n according to their multiplicities.
def func_1(n):
    factors = {}
    nn = n
    i = 2
    while i * i <= nn:
        while nn % i == 0:
            factors[i] = factors.get(i, 0) + 1
            nn //= i

    #State: primes
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 10^9 and returns all possible combinations of its prime factors along with their multiplicities through a generator function. It first finds the prime factors of `n` and their multiplicities, then yields each combination of these factors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9.
def generate(k):
    if (k == len(primes)) :
        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)

                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, k is not equal to the length of the list primes, rest is the result of calling generate(k + 1), prime is the value of primes[k], and the loop has executed all its iterations with prime_to_i being updated accordingly in each iteration.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If the length of the list `primes` is equal to `k`, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, `t` is within the specified range, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, and the result is the outcome of calling `generate(k + 1)`, where `prime` is the value at index `k` of the list `primes`, and `prime_to_i` has been updated accordingly in each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate(k)` accepts an integer `k` where 1 ≤ k ≤ 100 and returns a sequence of integers. If `k` equals the length of the list `primes`, it yields 1. Otherwise, it recursively generates factors by iterating over the remaining results of the recursive call and updating a multiplier `prime_to_i` for each prime number up to the current index `k` in the `primes` list. The function yields these updated multipliers as part of the sequence.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints for each test case.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Given the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received, we need to determine the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should give a remainder that matches the position of \( x \) in the repeating sequence.
   - The number of valid \( k \) values is related to the divisors of \( 2n - 2x \).

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to find all prime factors of \( n \).
   - **Function `generate`**: This function generates all possible products of the prime factors, which are essentially the divisors of \( n \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `generate` is correct for finding all divisors of a number.
   - However, the code does not actually use the divisors to solve the problem. Instead, it should use the relationship between \( n \), \( x \), and \( k \) to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.
   - The problem requires checking if \( 2n - 2x \) has an even number of divisors greater than 1, because \( k \) must be greater than 1.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - We need to calculate \( 2n - 2x \).
   - Find the divisors of \( 2n - 2x \).
   - Count the number of divisors greater than 1.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It focuses on generating divisors but does not use them to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.
