You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

                yield (factor * prime_to_i)
                prime_to_i *= prime

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 1
    h = n - x
    ans = set((k for k in func_1(h) if not k % 2 and k / 2 + 1 >= x))

def generate(k):

        yield 1
    else :
        rest = generate(k + 1)
        prime = primes[k]
        for factor in rest:
            prime_to_i = 1
            
            for _ in range(factors[prime] + 1):
                yield factor * prime_to_i
                prime_to_i *= prime
            
        #State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, k is not equal to the length of the list primes, rest is the result of calling generate(k + 1), prime is the value of primes[k], and the loop has executed all its iterations with prime_to_i being updated accordingly in each iteration.
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If the length of the list `primes` is equal to `k`, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, `t` is within the specified range, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, and the result is the outcome of calling `generate(k + 1)`, where `prime` is the value at index `k` of the list `primes`, and `prime_to_i` has been updated accordingly in each iteration of the loop.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `generate` do not seem to be related to the problem of determining the number of valid `k` values based on Vasya's position and the number he received during the settling. Instead, they appear to be attempting to generate prime factors and their combinations, which is not relevant to the problem description.

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many values of `k` fit the given constraints based on Vasya's position `n` and the number `x` he received. The settling pattern repeats every `2k-2` positions, and we need to check how many such `k` values satisfy the condition that the number at position `n` is `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def count_valid_k(n, x):
    count = 0
    # Check for k values from 2 to n
    for k in range(2, n + 1):
        # Calculate the position within the repeating cycle
        position_in_cycle = (n - 1) % (2 * k - 2)
        # Determine the number at the given position
        if position_in_cycle < k:
            number_at_position = position_in_cycle + 1
        else:
            number_at_position = 2 * k - 1 - position_in_cycle
        # Check if the number matches x
        if number_at_position == x:
            count += 1
    return count

# Reading input and processing test cases
t = int(input().strip())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().strip().split())
    print(count_valid_k(n, x))
```

This program correctly determines the number of valid `k` values based on the given constraints and should be used instead of the provided functions.
