The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. The function returns all possible combinations of the prime factors of `n` according to their multiplicities, which are generated by a generator function `generate`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` within the range 1 to 10^9, and returns all possible combinations of its prime factors along with their multiplicities through a generator function.**
