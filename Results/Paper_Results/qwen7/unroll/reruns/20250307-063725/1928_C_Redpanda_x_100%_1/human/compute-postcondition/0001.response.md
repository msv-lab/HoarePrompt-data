Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9, the length of the list primes is equal to k, 1 is yielded**.

The code `yield 1` does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, or the length of the list `primes`. It simply yields the value `1`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain the same as the initial state, with the additional information that `1` has been yielded.
