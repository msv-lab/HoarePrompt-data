Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If the length of the list `primes` is equal to `k`, then 1 is yielded. Otherwise, `t` is within the specified range, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, and the result is the outcome of calling `generate(k + 1)`, where `prime` is the value at index `k` of the list `primes`, and `prime_to_i` has been updated accordingly in each iteration of the loop.**
