Postcondition: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 <= x < n <= 10^9. If the length of the list `primes` is equal to `k`, the function yields 1. Otherwise, the function sets `t` to the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, where `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`, and updates `prime_to_i` accordingly after executing all iterations of the loop.
