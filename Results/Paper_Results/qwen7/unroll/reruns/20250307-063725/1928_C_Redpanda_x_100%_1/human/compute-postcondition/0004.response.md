Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100, `k` is not equal to the length of the list `primes`, `rest` is the result of calling `generate(k + 1)`, `prime` is the value of `primes[k]`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `primes[k]` to the variable `prime`. The values of `t`, `k`, and `rest` remain unchanged from their initial states.
