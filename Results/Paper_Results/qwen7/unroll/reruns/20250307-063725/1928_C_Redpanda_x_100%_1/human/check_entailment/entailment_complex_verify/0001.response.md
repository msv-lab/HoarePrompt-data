### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints for each test case.
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - Given the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received, we need to determine the possible values of \( k \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The position \( n \) modulo \( 2k - 2 \) should give a remainder that matches the position of \( x \) in the repeating sequence.
   - The number of valid \( k \) values is related to the divisors of \( 2n - 2x \).

3. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to find all prime factors of \( n \).
   - **Function `generate`**: This function generates all possible products of the prime factors, which are essentially the divisors of \( n \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` and `generate` is correct for finding all divisors of a number.
   - However, the code does not actually use the divisors to solve the problem. Instead, it should use the relationship between \( n \), \( x \), and \( k \) to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.
   - The problem requires checking if \( 2n - 2x \) has an even number of divisors greater than 1, because \( k \) must be greater than 1.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - We need to calculate \( 2n - 2x \).
   - Find the divisors of \( 2n - 2x \).
   - Count the number of divisors greater than 1.

6. **Evaluation of the Provided Code**:
   - The code calculates \( 2n - 2x \) correctly.
   - It uses `func_1` to find the prime factors of \( 2n - 2x \).
   - It then generates all possible combinations of these prime factors using `generate`.
   - The code filters out the divisors that are less than or equal to 1 and checks if they are even.
   - Finally, it counts the number of valid divisors.

7. **Validation Using Annotations**:
   - The annotations show that the code correctly identifies the prime factors and generates all possible divisors.
   - The filtering and counting logic ensures that only valid \( k \) values are counted.
   - The logic aligns with the requirement to count the number of divisors of \( 2n - 2x \) that are greater than 1 and even.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It calculates the necessary values and uses the correct logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values.

**Correctness: True**

### Final:
Final: **True**
