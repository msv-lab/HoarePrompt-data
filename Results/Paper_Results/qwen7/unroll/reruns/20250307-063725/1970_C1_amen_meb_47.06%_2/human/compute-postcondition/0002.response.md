Output State: **The variable `numbers` will contain a list of edge pairs (as lists of two integers each) entered by the user until a line with less than two elements is entered.**

Explanation: The loop continues to read pairs of integers from the user input and appends them as lists into the `numbers` list. This process stops when a line with less than two elements is entered. Since the initial conditions specify that the `numbers` list starts empty and the loop only appends valid pairs, the final state of `numbers` will be a list containing all the valid edge pairs provided by the user until an invalid input is given.
