Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is reading input from the user, but the problem description specifies that the input is already provided in the form of a tree structure and a list of starting nodes for each round. The program is designed to process input from standard input, which is not aligned with the problem's input format.

Additionally, the logic inside the main part of the program is flawed. It seems to be attempting to compare some values (`num_1` and `num_2`) to determine the winner, but these values are not defined in the context of the game rules provided. The game involves moving stones between nodes based on the tree structure, and the outcome depends on whether the number of moves available to Ron is odd or even. The current implementation does not reflect this logic.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Parse the tree structure and the list of starting nodes.
2. Determine the number of moves available to Ron for each starting node.
3. Check if the number of moves is odd or even to determine the winner.

Since the provided program does not follow the problem description and does not implement the required logic, it is incorrect.
