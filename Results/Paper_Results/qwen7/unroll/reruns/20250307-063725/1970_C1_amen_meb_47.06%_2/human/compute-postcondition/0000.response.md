Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The tree represented by the edges has exactly two leaves; `numbers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or the description of the tree. Therefore, the output state retains all the initial conditions except for the new list `numbers` which is now an empty list.
