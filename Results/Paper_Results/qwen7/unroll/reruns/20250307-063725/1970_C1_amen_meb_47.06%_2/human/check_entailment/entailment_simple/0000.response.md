Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is supposed to read input from the user until a line with less than two elements is entered. However, according to the problem statement, the input is already provided in the form of a predefined tree structure and not through user input. Therefore, the function `func_1()` does not match the expected behavior as per the problem description.
   - The problem specifies that the input is given directly in the code as part of the initial setup, and `func_1()` should not be reading from standard input. Instead, it should process the predefined tree structure.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic assumes that `func_1()` returns a list of edge pairs. However, since `func_1()` is defined to read from user input, which is not applicable here, the program's logic will not work as intended.
   - The main program then iterates over the result of `func_1()`, but since `func_1()` is not correctly implemented, the result will not be as expected. The logic inside the loop also does not make sense in the context of the game described.

Given these points, the program is fundamentally flawed because the function `func_1()` does not behave as expected and is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
