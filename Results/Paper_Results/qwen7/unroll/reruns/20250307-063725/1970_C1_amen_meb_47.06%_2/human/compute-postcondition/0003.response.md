Output State: **The program returns a list of edge pairs (each pair is a list of two integers) entered by the user until a line with less than two elements is entered.**

This means that the program collects edge pairs from the user input in the form of lists containing exactly two integers each, until the user enters a line with less than two elements. The collected pairs are then returned as a list.
