Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the median needs to be strictly greater than the current median after the operations. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
3
2
1 2
4
7 3 3 1
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1
2
2
```

However, the program will output:
```
1
2
2
```

But for the third test case, the program outputs `2`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1` because we only need to increment the first element from `1` to `2` to make the median `2`.

The program calculates the number of elements equal to the median in the sorted array but does not ensure that the median is strictly increased. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
