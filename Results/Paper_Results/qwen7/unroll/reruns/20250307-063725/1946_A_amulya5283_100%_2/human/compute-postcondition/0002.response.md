Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing an integer result from the loop's execution. For each test case, if `n` (the length of the list `a`) is 1, the output will be `1`. Otherwise, the output will be the count of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the middle element (or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even).

The loop processes each test case independently, so the output for each test case is determined based on the input provided for that specific test case. If the input list `a` has a single element, the output will be `1`. For lists with more than one element, the output will be the count of elements equal to the middle element(s) of the sorted list.
