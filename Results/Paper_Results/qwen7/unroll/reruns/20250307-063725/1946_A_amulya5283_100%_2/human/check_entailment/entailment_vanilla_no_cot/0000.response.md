Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The logic in the `for` loop is flawed. Specifically, it counts how many elements are equal to the current median, which is not what the problem requires. Instead, it should calculate how many operations are needed to make the median greater than its current value.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdx = n // 2
            target_median = a[mdx]
            res = 0
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[i] <= target_median:
                    res += target_median - a[i] + 1
                else:
                    break
            print(res)
```

This corrected version calculates the number of operations needed to make the median greater than its current value by iterating through the array from the middle index to the end and counting the necessary increments.
