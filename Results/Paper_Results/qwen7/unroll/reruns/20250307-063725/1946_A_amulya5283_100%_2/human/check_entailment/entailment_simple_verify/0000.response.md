### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
   
2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The median position `mdx` is calculated as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula gives the index of the middle element(s) in the sorted array.
   - If `n` is odd, `mdx` will point to the middle element. If `n` is even, `mdx` will point to the lower of the two middle elements.
   
4. **Counting Operations:**
   - The program counts how many elements in the sorted array are equal to the median value at position `mdx`.
   - This count is printed as the result, which is supposed to represent the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Median Increase:**
   - The program simply counts the number of elements equal to the current median. However, the problem requires the median to be strictly increased. The program does not ensure that the median is incremented to a value strictly greater than the current median.
   - For example, consider the input `[1, 2]`. The median is `1.5`, and the program would output `1` because there is one element equal to the median. However, the correct answer should be `1` because incrementing the first element to `2` makes the median `2`, which is strictly greater than `1.5`.

2. **Handling Even Length Arrays:**
   - For even-length arrays, the program might not handle the two middle elements correctly. The program assumes that the median is the lower of the two middle elements, but it should consider both middle elements to ensure the median is strictly increased.

### Example Analysis:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `2 1 2`
- Sorted: `[1, 2, 2]`
- Median: `2`
- Current median: `1.5`
- Count: `2` (both `2`s)
- Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `1`)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `7 3 3 1`
- Sorted: `[1, 3, 3, 7]`
- Median: `3`
- Current median: `3`
- Count: `2` (both `3`s)
- Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `2`)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `1 1`
- Sorted: `[1, 1]`
- Median: `1`
- Current median: `1`
- Count: `2` (both `1`s)
- Output: `2` (incorrect, should be `1`)

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to strictly increase the median. It only counts the number of elements equal to the current median, which does not guarantee that the median is increased.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
