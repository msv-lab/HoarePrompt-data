Output State: **The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing an integer representing the result of the operations inside the loop for each test case.**

Explanation: The loop processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, sorts the list, and then calculates and prints the number of elements from the middle index (or the first element of the second half if `n` is odd) to the end of the list that are equal to the middle element. The output for each test case is printed on a new line.
