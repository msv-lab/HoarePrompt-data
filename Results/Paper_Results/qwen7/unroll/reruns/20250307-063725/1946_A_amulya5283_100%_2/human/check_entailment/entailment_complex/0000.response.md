Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. An operation consists of incrementing any element by 1.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The median is determined by sorting the array and finding the middle value(s).
   - For an odd-length array, the median is the middle element.
   - For an even-length array, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but since we are dealing with integer increments, we need to ensure the middle element(s) are increased to the next integer value.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
   - The array is sorted, which is necessary to find the median.
   - The program calculates the median index (`mdx`), which is crucial for determining the middle element(s).
   - The program then iterates from `mdx` to the end of the array to check if the middle element(s) appear more than once. This logic seems flawed because it doesn't actually count how many operations are needed to make the median strictly greater than its current value.
   - The program directly prints the count of occurrences of the middle element(s) in the latter part of the array, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To increase the median, we need to ensure that the middle element(s) are incremented until they are strictly greater than their current value.
   - For an odd-length array, we need to increment the middle element.
   - For an even-length array, we need to increment both middle elements until they are strictly greater than their current values.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median. It simply counts occurrences without ensuring the median is increased.

Correctness: **False**
