You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array arr, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is the index in `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: `low` is the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`, `high` is `n`, `pos` is `-1`, `st` is a set containing all the mid indices that were added during the loop's execution, i.e., all integers from `low` to `n-1` inclusive.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: low + 1, 0
    #State: Postcondition: `low` is the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`, `high` is `n`, `pos` is either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[low] == k` or not, `st` is a set containing all the mid indices that were added during the loop's execution, i.e., all integers from `low` to `n-1` inclusive, and `arr[low]` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). The function returns a specific element from the list arr based on the value of k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
