### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem statement to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
1. **Binary Search Requirement**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly.
2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search should find the smallest index `l` such that `p_l` is equal to `x`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns a map object.
2. **Function `func_2`**: Converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list.
3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - **Step 1**: Read `n` and `k` using `func_1`.
   - **Step 2**: Convert the input line into a list using `func_2`.
   - **Step 3**: Find the position `pos` of `k` in the list.
   - **Step 4**: Perform a binary search to find the smallest index `low` such that `arr[low] >= k`.
   - **Step 5**: Print 0 if `arr[low] == k`, otherwise print 1 and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

#### Key Issues in the Provided Code:
1. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic in `func_3` does not ensure that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the loop ends. It only finds the smallest index `low` such that `arr[low] >= k`.
2. **Swaps**: The code does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `p_l` is equal to `x`. It only prints the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` without performing any swaps.

#### Correct Approach:
- **Finding `pos`**: Identify the position `pos` of `k` in the permutation.
- **Binary Search**: Perform the binary search to find the smallest index `low` such that `arr[low] >= k`.
- **Swaps**: Ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` by performing the necessary swaps.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```
- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  3 4
  5 6
  ```
- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  ```

The provided code only performs one swap, which is insufficient. To correct this, we need to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` by performing the necessary swaps.

#### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    if pos == -1:
        print(2)
        print(n, n-1)
        print(n-1, n)
    else:
        low, high = 0, n
        while low + 1 < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if arr[mid] > k:
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid
        if arr[low] == k:
            print(0)
        else:
            print(1)
            print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as required. The code does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search loop ends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
