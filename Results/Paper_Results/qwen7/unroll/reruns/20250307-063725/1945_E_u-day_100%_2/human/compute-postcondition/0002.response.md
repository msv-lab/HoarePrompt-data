Output State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.**

Explanation: The line `pos = -1` assigns the value `-1` to the variable `pos`. No other changes are made to the variables `n`, `k`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
