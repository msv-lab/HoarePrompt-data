Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`.
- `high` is `n`.
- `pos` is `-1`.
- `st` is a set containing all the mid indices that were added during the loop's execution, i.e., all integers from `low` to `n-1` inclusive.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

We need to determine the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1` that will be printed.

1. **Value of `low + 1`:**
   - `low` is defined as the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`.
   - This means `arr[low]` is the first element that is not greater than or equal to `k` when moving from left to right in the array.

2. **Value of `pos + 1`:**
   - `pos` is explicitly given as `-1`.
   - Therefore, `pos + 1` will be `-1 + 1 = 0`.

Given this analysis, the output will be:

Output: **low + 1, 0**
