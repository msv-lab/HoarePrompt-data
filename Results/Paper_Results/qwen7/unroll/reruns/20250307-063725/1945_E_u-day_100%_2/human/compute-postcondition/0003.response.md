State: **`pos` is -1, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, arr is the result of the function `func_2()` call, i is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function. Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0.
2. The loop itself does not directly modify `pos`, `n`, `k`, or `arr`, but these variables are part of the overall program state. Since the loop can only execute if these variables are in a valid state, they need to be included in the state description.
3. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, so it must be a positive integer.
4. `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, so it must satisfy this condition.
5. `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, so its state is already determined by the function's output.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should include `pos` being -1, `n` being a positive integer, `k` being an integer within the specified range, `arr` being the result of `func_2()`, and `i` being 0.
