Postcondition: `low` is the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`, `high` is `n`, `pos` is either `1` or `-1` depending on whether `arr[low] == k` or not, `st` is a set containing all the mid indices that were added during the loop's execution, i.e., all integers from `low` to `n-1` inclusive, and `arr[low]` is either equal to `k` or not equal to `k`.
