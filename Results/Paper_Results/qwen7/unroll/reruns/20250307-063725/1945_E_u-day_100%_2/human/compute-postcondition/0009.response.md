Output State: **`low` is the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`, `high` is `n`, `pos` is `-1`, `st` is a set containing all the mid indices that were added during the loop's execution, i.e., all integers from `low` to `n-1` inclusive.**

Explanation: The loop performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the position of `k`. However, since `pos` is initialized to `-1` and is not updated within the loop, it remains `-1`. The variable `st` collects all the mid indices that were added during the loop's execution. The loop continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`, meaning the search range has been narrowed down as much as possible without finding `k`. At this point, `low` will be the greatest index such that all elements at indices less than or equal to `low` are greater than or equal to `k`, and `high` will be `n`.
