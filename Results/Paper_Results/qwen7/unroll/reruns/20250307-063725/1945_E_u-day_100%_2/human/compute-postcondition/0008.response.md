Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.
3. The variables involved in the loop condition are `low` and `high`.

- `low` is currently 0.
- `high` is currently `n`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.

Given `low = 0`, the condition becomes `0 + 1 < high`, which simplifies to `1 < high`.

Therefore, `high` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

No other states need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `pos` is the index in `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set**
