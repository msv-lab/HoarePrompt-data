### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Function Summaries:
- **func_1**: Returns a map object containing the input split into integers.
- **func_2**: Converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list of integers.
- **func_3**: 
  - Accepts `n`, `k`, and a list `arr` representing a permutation.
  - Finds the smallest index `pos` where `arr[pos] == k` or the position just before the first element greater than `k`.
  - Prints 0 if `k` is found at the identified index, or 1 followed by the index and the previously found index `pos` if `k` is not found.

#### Analysis of `func_3`:
- The function `func_3` does not perform any swaps. It simply finds the position of `k` or the position just before the first element greater than `k`.
- The function then prints the result based on whether `k` is found or not.

Given the problem requirements, we need to ensure that after the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The current implementation does not account for the necessary swaps to achieve this.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  3 4
  5 6
  ```

- Actual Output of the Provided Code:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  ```

The expected output shows that two swaps are needed to place `3` at position `1`. However, the actual output shows only one swap. This indicates that the provided code is indeed missing the necessary logic to perform the required swaps.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search loop ends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
