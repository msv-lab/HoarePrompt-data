Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and the values of `n` and `k` are the results of the function `func_1()` call.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values replace the existing variables `n` and `k` in the current scope. Since the exact values returned by `func_1()` are not specified, we only know that `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain unchanged.
