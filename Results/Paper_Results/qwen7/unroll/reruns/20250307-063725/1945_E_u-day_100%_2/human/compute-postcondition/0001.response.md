Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation array `arr`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.**

Explanation: The code assigns the result of the function `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is determined by the function `func_1()`. The variable `arr` now holds the value returned by `func_2()`, which is expected to be a permutation array of length `n`.
