Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation array to ensure that the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at position \(l\).
2. The provided code attempts to find the position of \(x\) in the array and then uses a binary search-like approach to determine the necessary swaps.
3. However, the implementation of the binary search is flawed. Specifically, the variable `low` is updated incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.
4. The `low` and `high` variables should be used to narrow down the range where the target value \(k\) might be located, but the current implementation does not correctly update these variables.
5. The logic inside the while loop is also incorrect. The condition `if arr[mid] > k:` should be `if arr[mid] >= k:` to correctly handle the binary search.
6. Additionally, the output for the case when `arr[low] != k` is incorrect. It should print the indices of the elements to be swapped to make `arr[low]` equal to \(k\).

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality.

Correctness: **False**
