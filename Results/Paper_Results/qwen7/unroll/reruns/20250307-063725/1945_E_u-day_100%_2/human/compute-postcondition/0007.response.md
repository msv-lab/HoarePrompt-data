Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index in `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`, which was not previously defined in the initial state. All other variables (`low`, `high`, `pos`) retain their initial values or conditions.
