### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` correctly parses the input for each test case, returning a map object containing integers.
   - `func_2()` should ideally convert the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list. However, the current implementation of `func_2()` is incorrect because it does not actually call `func_1()` or handle the map object appropriately. This function is not properly defined in the given code snippet.

2. **Main Function `func_3()` Analysis:**
   - `func_3()` is supposed to find the correct positions to swap elements in the permutation array to ensure that the binary search will place the target value `k` at the correct position `l`.
   - The logic within `func_3()` is flawed. Specifically:
     - The binary search implemented inside `func_3()` does not actually sort the array; it just finds the position where `k` would fit in the sorted array.
     - The function does not perform any swaps to reorder the array. Instead, it prints the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` directly, which are not necessarily the correct positions to swap.
     - The function does not handle the case where `k` is already in the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), and it incorrectly prints `0` when `k` is found instead of printing the required swaps.

3. **Expected Behavior:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of `k` and the element that needs to be swapped with `k` to ensure the binary search works correctly.
   - We need to perform at most two swaps to achieve the desired state.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation of `func_3()` does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
