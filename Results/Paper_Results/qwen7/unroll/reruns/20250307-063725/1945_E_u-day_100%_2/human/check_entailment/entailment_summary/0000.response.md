Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find the target value \(x\) at the first position where it should be found.
- The provided code in `func_3()` does not actually perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it performs a binary search-like operation to find the position where \(x\) should be inserted to maintain the order and then prints the number of operations needed along with the positions of the swaps.
- The function `func_3()` does not implement the logic to swap elements in the permutation. It only finds the position where \(x\) should be and prints the result without making any changes to the permutation itself.
- Since the problem statement specifies that the solution should include the actual swapping of elements, the provided code does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
