Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required solution. The program attempts to find the position of `k` in the array using binary search directly without any swaps. However, the problem requires rearranging the array with at most two swaps so that `p_l` is equal to `x` after performing the binary search. The given implementation does not account for the necessary swaps to achieve this.

To solve the problem correctly, the program should identify the positions of `x` and either `l` or `r` (or both) and perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `p_l` is `x` when the binary search is applied. The current implementation only finds the position of `x` and does not handle the swaps needed to satisfy the problem's requirements.
