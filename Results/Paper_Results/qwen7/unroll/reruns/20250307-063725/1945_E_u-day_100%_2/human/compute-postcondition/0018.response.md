Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing a permutation. It determines if `k` is present in `arr` and, if so, finds the smallest index greater than or equal to `k`. If `k` is not present, it identifies the position just before the first element greater than `k`. The function then prints either 0 if `k` is found at the identified index, or 1 followed by the index and the previously found index `pos` if `k` is not found.**
