Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index in `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, setting `low` to 0 and `high` to `n`. The variable `pos` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index in `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`.
