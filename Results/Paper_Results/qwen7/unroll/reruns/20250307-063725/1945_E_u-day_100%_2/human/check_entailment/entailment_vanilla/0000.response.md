### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at the `l`-th position after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is supposed to find the index of `x` in the permutation.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in terms of its logic. It initializes `l` to 1 and `r` to `n+1`, and iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the correct position for `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_3` attempts to find the position of `x` in the permutation and then performs a binary search. However, the binary search part of the code does not actually perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it prints the index where `x` should be found, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

4. **Swaps Required**: The problem states that you can perform up to 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The function `func_3` does not account for these swaps. Instead, it directly prints the index of `x` without rearranging the permutation.

5. **Example Analysis**: Let's analyze the example provided:
   - For the input `6 3 1 2 3 4 5 6`, the function should find that `x` is at index 2 (0-based index). However, it prints `0`, which means no swaps are needed. This is incorrect because the permutation is already in the correct order.
   - For the input `6 5 3 1 6 5 2 4`, the function should find that `x` is at index 4 (0-based index). It prints `1` and the swap `3 4`, which is correct because swapping `p[3]` and `p[4]` places `5` at the correct position.

6. **Conclusion**: The function `func_3` does not correctly implement the required logic to rearrange the permutation with at most 2 swaps before performing the binary search. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
