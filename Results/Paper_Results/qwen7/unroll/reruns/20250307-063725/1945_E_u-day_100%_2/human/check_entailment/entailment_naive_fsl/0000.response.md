Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses `func_3` to perform the binary search, but it does not ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after the binary search loop ends. Instead, it simply finds the middle index `m` and adjusts the `l` and `r` pointers based on the comparison with `x`. This approach does not guarantee that `p_l` will be equal to `x` after the loop ends.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  3 4
  5 6
  ```

- Actual Output of the Provided Code:
  ```
  1
  3 4
  ```

In this case, the provided code only performs one swap, which is not enough to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. The correct solution should perform two swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search loop ends. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
