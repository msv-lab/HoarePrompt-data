Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i > 1`.

2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

3. **Determine the current state of `i`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.

4. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than 1.

5. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: Given that `i = L[-1] - 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`. This simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

6. **Check the current state of `L[-1]`**: The current state is `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, and `R[0]` is equal to `N`.

7. **Ensure the condition is met**: Since `L[-1]` is equal to `N`, we need to ensure that `N > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `N` must be greater than 2.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `N` must be greater than 2, `M1` is an input integer greater than 1, `M2` is an input integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`**
