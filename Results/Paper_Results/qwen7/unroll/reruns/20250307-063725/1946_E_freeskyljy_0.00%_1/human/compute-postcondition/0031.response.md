Output State: **The program returns 0**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `nums_left` is 0, and `ans` is calculated based on certain conditions involving `M1`, `N`, `L`, and `MOD`. Since `nums_left` is 0, regardless of the value of `ans` before the return statement, multiplying `ans` by `nums_left` will result in 0. Therefore, the program returns 0.
