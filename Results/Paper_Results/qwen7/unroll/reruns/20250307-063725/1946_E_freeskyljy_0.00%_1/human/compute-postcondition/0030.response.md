Postcondition: **`nums_left` is 0, `cur` is `R.count(R[0]) + 1`, and `ans` remains as the initial value `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` (which is 0) modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2.**

Explanation: Regardless of whether the condition `M2 > 1` is true or false, the final value of `nums_left` will be 0 after the loop completes. Consequently, the value of `ans` does not change because `nums_left` is multiplied by `ans` and `nums_left` is 0. The value of `cur` will be `R.count(R[0]) + 1` due to the loop's behavior.
