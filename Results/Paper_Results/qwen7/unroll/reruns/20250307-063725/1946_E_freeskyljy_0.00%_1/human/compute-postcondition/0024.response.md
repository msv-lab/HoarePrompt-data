Postcondition: `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `ans` remains as the initial value `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2. Additionally, the condition `(M2 > 1)` is true.
