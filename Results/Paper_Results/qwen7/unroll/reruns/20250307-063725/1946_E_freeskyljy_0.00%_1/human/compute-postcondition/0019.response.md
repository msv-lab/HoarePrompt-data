Output State: The value of `ans` will be the result of the modular multiplication and decrement operations performed within the loop, starting from `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` and updating `ans` in each iteration based on the value of `nums_left`. The variable `cur` will be updated to point to the previous index in the list `L` when `i` equals `L[cur]`, and `nums_left` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until `i` becomes 1. The final value of `ans` will be the product of `ans` and `nums_left` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, modulo `MOD`.

Since the exact values of `N`, `L`, and `MOD` are not provided, we cannot compute a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, the process described above outlines how `ans` is updated during the loop's execution.
