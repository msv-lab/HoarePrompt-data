Output State: **`nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `ans` remains as the initial value `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums_left` to `N - R[0] - 1`. However, the value of `ans` is not directly modified by this line of code. The value of `ans` depends on the condition `M1 > 1`. If `M1 <= 1`, `ans` remains unchanged as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. If `M1 > 1`, `ans` is updated based on the specified calculation involving `nums_left`. Since the condition `M1 > 1` is not evaluated here, `ans` retains its initial state.
