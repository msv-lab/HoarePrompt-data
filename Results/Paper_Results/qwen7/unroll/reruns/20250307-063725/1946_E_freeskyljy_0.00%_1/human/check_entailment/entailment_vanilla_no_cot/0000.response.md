Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incomplete Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined but never fully implemented. The program tries to calculate the number of permutations but does not handle all edge cases and logical conditions properly.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle all possible edge cases correctly. For example, it checks if the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum are the same, but it does not handle other critical conditions that should be checked.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Combinations**: The combination calculation (`math.comb`) is used incorrectly. The logic to compute the number of valid permutations is flawed and does not cover all necessary conditions.

4. **Logical Errors**: There are logical errors in how the program processes the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The program does not correctly account for the constraints and relationships between these indices.

5. **Incomplete Logic**: The program does not fully implement the logic required to determine the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximum indices.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to ensure that all conditions and constraints are properly handled, and the combinatorial calculations are accurate. The provided solution does not meet these requirements.
