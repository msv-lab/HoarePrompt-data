Output State: `cur` is `cur + 1`, `nums_left` is `0`, `ans` is the initial value of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` (which is 0) modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, and `i` is `R[0] + 1`.

Explanation: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = N-1`. For each iteration, if `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. Since `nums_left` starts at `N - R[0] - 1` and is decremented until it reaches 0, the final value of `nums_left` will be 0. Therefore, the final value of `ans` will be 0 because any number multiplied by 0 is 0.
