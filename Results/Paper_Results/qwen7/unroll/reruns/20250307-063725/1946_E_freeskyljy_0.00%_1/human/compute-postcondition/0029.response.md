Output State: `cur` is `R.count(R[0]) + 1`, `nums_left` is `0`, `ans` is the initial value `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` (which is 0) modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, and `i` is `R[0] + 1`.

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = N-1`. In each iteration, if `i` equals `R[cur]`, `cur` increments by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` decreases by 1 in every iteration. Since `nums_left` starts at `N - R[0] - 1` and decreases by 1 until it reaches 0, the final value of `nums_left` will be 0 after `N - R[0]` iterations. The value of `cur` will increment once for each occurrence of `R[cur]` within the range `[0, N-1]`, plus the initial value of 1, resulting in `cur` being `R.count(R[0]) + 1`. Since `nums_left` becomes 0, any further multiplications involving it will result in `ans` remaining unchanged.
