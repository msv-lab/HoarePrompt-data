Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer greater than 1, `M2` is an input integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is assigned the value `L[-1] - 1`. All other variables retain their previous values.
