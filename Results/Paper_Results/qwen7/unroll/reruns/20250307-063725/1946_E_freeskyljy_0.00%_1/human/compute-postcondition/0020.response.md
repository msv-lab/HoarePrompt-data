Output State: `ans` is the result of multiplying `ans` by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, where `cur` is decremented when `i` equals `L[cur]`, and `nums_left` and `i` are decremented in each iteration. The final value of `ans` after the loop completes will be the product of `ans` and `nums_left` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, under the modulo operation with `MOD`.

To break it down further:
- Initially, `ans` is set to `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`.
- `cur` starts at `M1 - 2`.
- `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2`.
- `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1`.

For each iteration of the loop:
- If `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD`.
- Both `nums_left` and `i` are decremented by 1.

After the loop completes, `ans` will hold the final computed value based on the described operations.
