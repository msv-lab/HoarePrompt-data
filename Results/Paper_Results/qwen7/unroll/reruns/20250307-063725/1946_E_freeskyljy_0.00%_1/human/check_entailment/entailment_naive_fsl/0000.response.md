Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility that the last prefix maximum and the first suffix maximum might not be the same, which is a requirement according to the problem description. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
4 2 3
1 3
2 3 4
```

According to the problem description, the indices of the prefix maximums are `1` and `3`, and the indices of the suffix maximums are `2`, `3`, and `4`. This means that the permutation must satisfy the conditions that the element at index `1` is the prefix maximum, the element at index `3` is the prefix maximum, and the elements at indices `2`, `3`, and `4` are suffix maximums.

However, the program incorrectly returns `0` for this case because it checks if the last prefix maximum (`3`) is equal to the first suffix maximum (`2`), which is not true. Therefore, the program does not correctly handle this scenario, making it incorrect.
