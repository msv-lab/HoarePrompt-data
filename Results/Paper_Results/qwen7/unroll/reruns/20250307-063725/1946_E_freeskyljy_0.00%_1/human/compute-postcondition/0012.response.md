Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N` is an input integer, `M1` is an input integer, `M2` is an input integer, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer, `L[-1]` is equal to `R[0]`, `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is equal to `N`, `M1` is less than or equal to 1 or `M2` is less than or equal to 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**.

This means that the variable `ans` has been calculated as the result of the combination function applied to `N - 1` and `L[-1] - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
