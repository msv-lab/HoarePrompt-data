Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer, M1 is an input integer, M2 is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
