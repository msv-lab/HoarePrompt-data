Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, N is an input integer, M1 is an input integer, M2 is an input integer, L is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a single line of input, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list `L` is assigned to the variable `L`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged.
