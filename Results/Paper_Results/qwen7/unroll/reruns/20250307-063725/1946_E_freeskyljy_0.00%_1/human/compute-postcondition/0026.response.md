Output State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `ans` remains as the initial value `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, and `i` is `R[0] + 1`**.

This means that the variable `i` has been assigned the value `R[0] + 1`, while the other variables (`cur`, `nums_left`, `ans`, `M1`, `M2`, `N`, `R`, `L`, and `MOD`) retain their previous values or conditions.
