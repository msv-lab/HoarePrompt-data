Output State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `ans` remains as the initial value `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` if `M1 <= 1`, otherwise `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD` for each `i` from `L[-1] - 1` down to 2, and the condition `(M2 > 1)` is true.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `cur` to 1. This does not affect the values of `nums_left`, `ans`, `M1`, `M2`, `N`, `R[0]`, `L`, or the condition `(M2 > 1)`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
