Reasoning:
1. **Input Reading and Validation**: The program correctly reads the input values for `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, and `R`. It also checks several conditions to ensure that the indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the properties of a permutation.
2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program handles edge cases where the last index of prefix maximums (`L[-1]`) is not equal to the first index of suffix maximums (`R[0]`), or where the first index of prefix maximums (`L[0]`) is not 1 or the first index of suffix maximums (`R[0]`) is not `N`. In such cases, it correctly returns 0.
3. **Combination Calculation**: The program uses the `math.comb` function to calculate the number of suitable permutations based on the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums. This calculation is done correctly, taking into account the positions of the maximums and ensuring that the resulting value is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
4. **Loop Logic**: The loops in the program correctly iterate through the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums, updating the answer based on the combinatorial calculations and the remaining numbers available for placement.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described in the problem statement and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
