Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, N is an input integer, M1 is an input integer, M2 is an input integer, R is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `R`. The variables `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged from their initial states.
