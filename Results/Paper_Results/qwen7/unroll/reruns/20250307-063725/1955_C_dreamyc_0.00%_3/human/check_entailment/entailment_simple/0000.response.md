Reasoning:
1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and the list of ship durabilities `nums`. It then calls `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a `deque` from the list `nums` and sets `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as there are at least 2 ships left and there are still attacks (`k > 0`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the `deque` and calculates the minimum durability between them (`x`).
   - If the remaining attacks (`k`) are enough to sink both ships, it reduces their durability by `x` and decreases `k` by `2*x`. Otherwise, it breaks out of the loop.
   - After each attack, it checks if the ship's durability is still positive. If so, it appends it back to the `deque`. If not, it increments `ans` by 1.
3. **Final Check**:
   - After the loop, if there is exactly one ship left and there are still attacks remaining (`k`), it checks if the remaining attacks are sufficient to sink this ship. If so, it increments `ans` by 1.
   - The function then returns `ans`, which represents the total number of ships that were sunk.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program correctly simulates the process of the Kraken attacking the ships and counts the number of ships that are sunk. The provided example outputs match the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
