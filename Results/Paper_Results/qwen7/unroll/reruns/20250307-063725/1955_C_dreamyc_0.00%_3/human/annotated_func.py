#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

        if k >= 2 * x:

    #State: The output state will be that `ans` is the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed, and `nums` will contain at most one element that is greater than 0.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed plus 1
    #State: `ans` is the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed, and `nums` will contain at least one element that is greater than 0, and `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums) == 1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest pair of elements and reducing their values by half of the smaller value until `k` becomes insufficient or no more pairs can be processed. After the loop, the function returns the total count of elements in `nums` that have become zero or negative, plus 1 in certain cases.
