You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Program:
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):
        return ans + 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest pair of elements and reducing their values by half of the smaller value until `k` becomes insufficient or no more pairs can be processed. After the loop, the function returns the total count of elements in `nums` that have become zero or negative, plus 1 in certain cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a ship's durability is exactly half of the remaining attacks (`k`). Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 10
  5 5 5 5 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the number of ships sunk. The first and last ships are attacked 5 times each, reducing their durability to 0, but the middle three ships are only attacked 4 times each, leaving them with a durability of 1. Since `k` is reduced by 10, the program should sink all 5 ships, but it only sinks 4.

The issue arises because the program breaks out of the loop prematurely when it encounters a ship with positive durability, without accounting for the exact remaining attacks needed to sink the ship. This can be fixed by ensuring that the loop continues until all ships are either sunk or no more attacks are possible.
