Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a ship's durability is exactly half of the remaining attacks (`k`). Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  5 10
  5 5 5 5 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates the number of ships sunk. The first and last ships are attacked 5 times each, reducing their durability to 0, but the middle three ships are only attacked 4 times each, leaving them with a durability of 1. Since `k` is reduced by 10, the program should sink all 5 ships, but it only sinks 4.

The issue arises because the program breaks out of the loop prematurely when it encounters a ship with positive durability, without accounting for the exact remaining attacks needed to sink the ship. This can be fixed by ensuring that the loop continues until all ships are either sunk or no more attacks are possible.
