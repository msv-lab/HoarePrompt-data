### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the attacks of the Kraken on the ships.
   - The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately until either all ships sink or there are no more attacks left.

2. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends.
   - It iterates through the attacks, reducing the durability of the ships and counting the number of ships that sink.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `T` is read and used to loop over test cases.
     - For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `nums` are read and processed.
   - **Main Logic (`func_1`):**
     - A deque is initialized with the ship durabilities.
     - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of sunk ships.
     - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are at least two ships left and attacks remain.
     - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements, calculates the minimum durability, and reduces the durability accordingly.
     - If the durability of a ship reaches zero, it is considered sunk and `ans` is incremented.
     - The remaining non-zero durabilities are re-added to the deque.
     - After the loop, if there is one ship left and it still has durability, it is considered sunk.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program correctly handles scenarios where the number of attacks is less than the total durability required to sink all ships.
     - It also correctly handles scenarios where the number of attacks is sufficient to sink all ships.

4. **Testing the Example:**
   - The provided example tests cover various scenarios including different numbers of ships, different attack counts, and different initial durabilities.
   - The program passes all these examples correctly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the program is sound and correctly simulates the described behavior of the Kraken attacking the ships.
   - There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.
