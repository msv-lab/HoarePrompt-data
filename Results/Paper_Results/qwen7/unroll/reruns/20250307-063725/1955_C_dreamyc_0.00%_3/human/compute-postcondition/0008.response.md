Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed plus 1, or the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed.**
