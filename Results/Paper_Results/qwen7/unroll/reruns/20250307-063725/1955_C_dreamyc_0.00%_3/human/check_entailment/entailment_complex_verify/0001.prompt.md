You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: `ans` is the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed, and `nums` will contain at least one element that is greater than 0, and `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums) == 1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly removing the smallest pair of elements and reducing their values by half of the smaller value until `k` becomes insufficient or no more pairs can be processed. After the loop, the function returns the total count of elements in `nums` that have become zero or negative, plus 1 in certain cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the attacks of the Kraken on the ships.
   - The Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately until either all ships sink or there are no more attacks left.

2. **Key Points in the Program:**
   - The program uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends.
   - It iterates through the attacks, reducing the durability of the ships and counting the number of ships that sink.

3. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - **Initialization:**
     - `T` is read and used to loop over test cases.
     - For each test case, `n`, `k`, and `nums` are read and processed.
   - **Main Logic (`func_1`):**
     - A deque is initialized with the ship durabilities.
     - The variable `ans` keeps track of the number of sunk ships.
     - The program enters a while loop that continues as long as there are at least two ships left and attacks remain.
     - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements, calculates the minimum durability, and reduces the durability accordingly.
     - If the durability of a ship reaches zero, it is considered sunk and `ans` is incremented.
     - The remaining non-zero durabilities are re-added to the deque.
     - After the loop, if there is one ship left and it still has durability, it is considered sunk.
   - **Edge Cases:**
     - The program correctly handles scenarios where the number of attacks is less than the total durability required to sink all ships.
     - It also correctly handles scenarios where the number of attacks is sufficient to sink all ships.

4. **Testing the Example:**
   - The provided example tests cover various scenarios including different numbers of ships, different attack counts, and different initial durabilities.
   - The program passes all these examples correctly.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The logic in the program is sound and correctly simulates the described behavior of the Kraken attacking the ships.
   - There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.
