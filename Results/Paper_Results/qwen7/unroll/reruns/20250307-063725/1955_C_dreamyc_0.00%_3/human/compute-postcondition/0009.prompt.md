You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: The output state will be that `ans` is the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed, and `nums` will contain at most one element that is greater than 0.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed plus 1
    #State: `ans` is the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed, and `nums` will contain at least one element that is greater than 0, and `k` is less than `nums[0]` if `len(nums) == 1`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed plus 1, or the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed plus 1

Case_2: The program returns the total count of elements in `nums` that become zero or negative after the loop has executed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
