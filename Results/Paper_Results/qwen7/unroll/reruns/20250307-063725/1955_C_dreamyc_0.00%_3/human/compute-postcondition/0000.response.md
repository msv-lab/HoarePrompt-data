Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `nums = deque(nums)` changes the type of the `nums` list to a deque (double-ended queue). However, the values and constraints of the variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and the contents of `nums` remain the same as the initial state.
