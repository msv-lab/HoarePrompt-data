Output State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The line `ans = 0` initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `nums`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
