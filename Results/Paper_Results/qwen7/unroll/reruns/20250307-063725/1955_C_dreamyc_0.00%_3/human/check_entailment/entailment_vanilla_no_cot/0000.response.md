Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining attacks when there are fewer than two ships left is incorrect. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks:**
   - The current implementation checks if there is exactly one ship left (`len(nums) == 1`) and if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of that ship.
   - However, this check should also consider whether the remaining attacks can sink the last ship. The current logic might prematurely conclude that the last ship is not sunk if there are still some attacks left but not enough to sink it.

2. **Simpler and Correct Approach:**
   - Instead of checking the exact condition, we should directly calculate the number of ships that would be sunk based on the total number of attacks and the durabilities of the ships.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    # Handle the remaining attacks if there is exactly one ship left
    if k and len(nums) == 1:
        if k >= nums[0]:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

This corrected version ensures that the last ship is correctly checked for sinking based on the remaining attacks. The logic now correctly handles the scenario where the last ship might still be attacked even if there are fewer than two ships left.
