### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the attacks by the Kraken on the ships.
   - The Kraken attacks in an alternating pattern: first the first ship, then the last ship, and so on.
   - Each attack reduces the durability of the ship by 1.
   - A ship sinks when its durability drops to 0 and is no longer attacked.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code uses a deque to efficiently manage the first and last elements of the list of ship durabilities.
   - The function `func_1` is responsible for simulating the attacks.
   - The loop continues until either there are fewer than 2 ships left or the number of attacks remaining (`k`) is insufficient to make further attacks.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The logic for reducing the durability of the ships during each attack is correct.
   - The handling of the first and last ships is done correctly using the `popleft` and `pop` methods of the deque.
   - The condition checks to ensure that a ship sinks when its durability reaches 0 and increments the count of sunk ships accordingly.
   - The final check ensures that if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked, it is counted as sunk.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where the last ship is the only one left and can still be attacked.
   - It correctly breaks out of the loop when there are fewer than 2 ships left or when the number of attacks is insufficient.

5. **Testing with Provided Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The code correctly counts the number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The code accurately simulates the attacks by the Kraken and correctly counts the number of sunk ships. Therefore, the given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
