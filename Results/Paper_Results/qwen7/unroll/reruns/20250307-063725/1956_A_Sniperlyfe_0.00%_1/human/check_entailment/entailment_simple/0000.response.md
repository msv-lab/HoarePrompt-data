### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the number of players who remain in the game after multiple rounds of elimination.
   - In each round, players at positions specified by the sequence \(a\) are eliminated.
   - The game ends when no more players can be eliminated in a round.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simulates the game for a given initial number of players `n`.
   - It repeatedly eliminates players until no more players can be eliminated.
   - The function correctly reduces `n` by the number of players eliminated in each round.
   - The function returns the number of players remaining in the game.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each initial player count `n` in `qs` and prints the results.

4. **Execution States:**
   - The provided comments describe the state transitions correctly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the elimination process and returns the correct number of remaining players.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the game simulation and multiple test cases as required.

### Correctness:
**True**
