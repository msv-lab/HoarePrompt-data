### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions specified by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain at the end of the game.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function aims to calculate the number of players remaining after removing players according to the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - It uses a while loop to repeatedly remove players from the sequence until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each initial number of players `n`.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct. It correctly simulates the removal process by decrementing `n` by the count of players that can be removed in each iteration.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the results as required.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`, ensuring no further players are removed.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over `qs` and appending results to `res`.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements, printing the results for each test case on a new line.

### Conclusion:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of winners for each initial number of players `n`. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are implemented correctly and handle all aspects of the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
