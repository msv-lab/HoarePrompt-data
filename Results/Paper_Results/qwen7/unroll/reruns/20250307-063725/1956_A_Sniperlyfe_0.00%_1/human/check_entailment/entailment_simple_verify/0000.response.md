### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior compared to the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1(n, p)` aims to simulate the process of removing players based on the sequence `p`.
- The logic in `func_1` uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the count of players that need to be removed from the current number of players `n` until `n` is less than the minimum element in `p`.
- However, this approach does not correctly simulate the removal of players based on their positions. It simply subtracts the sum of elements in `p` from `n` repeatedly, which does not match the problem's requirement of removing players at specific positions.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement with `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5` using the function `func_1`:

1. **Initial State**: `n = 5`, `p = [3, 5]`
2. **First Iteration**:
   - `min(p) = 3`
   - `sum(x for x in p if x <= n) = 3 + 5 = 8` (since both 3 and 5 are less than or equal to 5)
   - `n -= 8` (but since `n` is 5, it becomes 5 - 8 = -3, which is invalid)
   - `n` is set to 0 (assuming it wraps around to 0)

This behavior is clearly incorrect because it does not simulate the removal of players at positions 3 and 5 as specified in the problem.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input values for `t`, `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs`.
- For each value `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1(n, p)` and appends the result to `res`.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the issues in `func_1`, the overall behavior of `func_2` is also incorrect because it relies on the flawed logic in `func_1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` does not simulate the removal of players based on their positions, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
