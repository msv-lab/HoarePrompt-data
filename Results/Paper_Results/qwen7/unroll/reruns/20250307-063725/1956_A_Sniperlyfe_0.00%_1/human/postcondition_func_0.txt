The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and `p`, a list of positive integers representing a sequence where each element is less than or equal to 100 and in ascending order. It repeatedly reduces `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the minimum element in `p`. Finally, it returns 0 if `n` becomes 0 during the process; otherwise, it returns the smallest element in `p` that is greater than the original `n`.
