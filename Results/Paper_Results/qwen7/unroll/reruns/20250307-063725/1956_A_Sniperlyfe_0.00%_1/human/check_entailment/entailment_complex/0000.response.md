Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game's process by repeatedly reducing the number of players (`n`) by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - It returns the smallest element in `p` that is greater than the original `n` if `n` is reduced to 0 during the process, or 0 if `n` remains non-zero.
   - This logic aligns with the problem description, ensuring that players are removed in rounds based on the sequence `p` and the game ends when no more players can be removed.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem.
   - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case, calls `func_1` for each initial number of players (`n`), and collects the results.
   - The results are printed after processing each test case, which matches the expected output format.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions together correctly implement the game logic and handle multiple test cases as required.
   - The logic in both functions accurately reflects the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the analysis, the program is designed to correctly simulate the game and produce the expected outputs for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
