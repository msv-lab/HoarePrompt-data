Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of winners in a game based on a specific sequence of player positions to be removed in each round.
- The key logic is implemented in `func_1`, which simulates the removal process and calculates the number of remaining players.
- `func_2` processes multiple test cases, reading inputs and calling `func_1` for each test case, then printing the results.
- The execution summary of `func_2` correctly describes its behavior, including handling multiple test cases and using `func_1` appropriately.
- Given the problem description and the provided code, `func_1` accurately implements the logic to determine the number of winners based on the sequence `p` and the initial number of players `n`.
- Since both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the required logic as per the problem statement and the provided execution summaries, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
