Output State: **After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the variable `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `qs` for each iteration, with the results printed after each iteration. The final state of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` will be updated according to the inputs provided during each iteration, while `t` will be decremented until it reaches zero.**
