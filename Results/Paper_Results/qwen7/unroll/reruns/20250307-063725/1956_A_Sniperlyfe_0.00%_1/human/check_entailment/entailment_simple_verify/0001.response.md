### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of removing players from the game according to the sequence `p`.
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed. Specifically, the inner loop `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` is used to count the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. This is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the removal of players.
   - The function should remove players in the order specified by `p` and stop once no more players can be removed. Instead, the current implementation simply subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`, which does not accurately reflect the game's rules.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect and does not simulate the game's rules properly.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each case as required, but it relies on the incorrect `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function `func_1` does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`, it should skip those indices, but the current implementation does not do this correctly.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and handles different values of `n` within the constraints, but it is dependent on the incorrect `func_1`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the game's rules. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the removal of players according to the sequence `p`.

The given program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
