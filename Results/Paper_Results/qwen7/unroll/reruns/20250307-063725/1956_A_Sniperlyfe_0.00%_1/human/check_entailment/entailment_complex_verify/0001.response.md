### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of removing players from the game according to the sequence `p`.
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - Inside the loop, it subtracts the number of players to be removed (`sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`) from `n`.
   - However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the expression `sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` is used to count the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`, which is not the correct way to simulate the removal process. Instead, it should directly remove the players whose positions match the values in `p`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - For each `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is incorrect because it does not actually simulate the removal of players according to the sequence `p`. Instead, it simply counts the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` and subtracts that count from `n`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each case as required, but since `func_1` is incorrect, the results will be wrong.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For example, if `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`, it should skip those indices, but the current implementation does not do this properly.
   - The function also does not correctly simulate the removal of players in the sequence `p`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the described game rules. The logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not accurately simulate the removal of players.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect based on the provided problem description.
