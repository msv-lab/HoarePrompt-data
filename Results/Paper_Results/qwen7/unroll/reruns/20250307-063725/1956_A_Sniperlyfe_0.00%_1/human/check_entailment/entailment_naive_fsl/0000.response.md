Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. 

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement with `a = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`. According to the problem description, the game proceeds as follows:

1. Initial lineup: ABCDE
2. First round: C and E are kicked out, leaving ABD.
3. Second round: Only D is kicked out, leaving AB.
4. Third round: No one is kicked out, so AB are declared as winners.

However, the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate this process. Instead, it attempts to subtract the sum of elements in `p` from `n` repeatedly until `n` is less than the minimum element in `p`. This approach does not account for the fact that players are only removed if their position matches an element in `p`.

For instance, with `n = 5` and `p = [3, 5]`, the function will incorrectly reduce `n` by 3 and 5 in the first step, resulting in `n = 0`, which is not the correct behavior according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the game logic and hence is incorrect.
