You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p is a list of k positive integers where 1 ≤ p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] ≤ 100; qs is a list of q positive integers where 1 ≤ qs[i] ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ i < q.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the variable `res` will contain the results of applying `func_1` to each element in `qs` for each iteration, with the results printed after each iteration. The final state of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` will be updated according to the inputs provided during each iteration, while `t` will be decremented until it reaches zero.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists k and q, where k and q are positive integers within the range of 1 to 100. It also uses a list p containing k positive integers in ascending order and a list qs containing q positive integers. The function returns a specific value based on the relationship between elements in p and qs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
