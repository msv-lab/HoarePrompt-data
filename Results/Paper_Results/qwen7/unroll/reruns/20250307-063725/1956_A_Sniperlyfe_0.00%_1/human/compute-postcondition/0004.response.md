Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases (controlled by `t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `k` and `q`, followed by a list `p` of `k` sorted positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then applies another function `func_1` to each element in `qs`, storing the results in a list `res`. After processing all elements in `qs`, it prints the contents of `res` for that test case. This process repeats for each test case until all are processed. The final state includes updated values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` based on the inputs provided during each iteration, and `t` is decremented to zero.**
