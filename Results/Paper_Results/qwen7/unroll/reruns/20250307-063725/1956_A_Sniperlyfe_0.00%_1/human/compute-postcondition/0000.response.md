Output State: **`k` and `q` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `k`, `q` ≤ 100; `p` is a list of `k` positive integers where 1 ≤ `p[0]` < `p[1]` < ... < `p[k-1]` ≤ 100; `qs` is a list of `q` positive integers where 1 ≤ `qs[i]` ≤ 100 for all 0 ≤ `i` < `q`; `t` is an input integer.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` remain unchanged from their initial state.
