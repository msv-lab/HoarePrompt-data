Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.**

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `t`. The initial conditions for `start` and `end` remain unchanged, so they are still integers such that `start` <= `end`.
