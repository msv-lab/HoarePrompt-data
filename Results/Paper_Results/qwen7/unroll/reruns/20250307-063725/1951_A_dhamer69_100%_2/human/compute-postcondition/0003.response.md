Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body.

For each iteration:
- If `n` is 2, the program checks if `s` is '00'. If it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is not 2, the program counts the number of '1's in `s`. If this count is odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count is 2 and there is exactly one occurrence of '11', it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs corresponding to each input pair `(n, s)` provided during the loop iterations.
