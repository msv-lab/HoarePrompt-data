Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration of `t`.

For each iteration of the loop:
- If `n` is 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not 2, it checks if the number of '1's in `s` is odd, then prints 'NO'. 
- It also checks if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and two '1's in total, printing 'NO' in that case.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed during the loop's execution, depending on the values of `n` and `s` provided in each iteration.
