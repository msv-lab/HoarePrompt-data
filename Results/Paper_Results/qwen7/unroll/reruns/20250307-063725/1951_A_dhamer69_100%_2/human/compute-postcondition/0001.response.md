Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since the loop condition depends solely on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
