The function `func` accepts no parameters directly but uses two integers `start` and `end` as constraints for filtering folder names, where `start` and `end` are digits and `start` is less than or equal to `end`. The function's output depends on whether the folder names meet these criteria. If a folder name is a digit within the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive), the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Functionality: **The function filters folder names to check if they are digits within the range from `start` to `end` (inclusive). If the folder name is a digit within this range, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
