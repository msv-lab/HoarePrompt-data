Functionality: The function processes a series of input pairs `(n, s)`. For each pair, if `n` is 2, it checks if `s` is exactly '00'; otherwise, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final output consists of a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' responses corresponding to each input pair `(n, s)`.
