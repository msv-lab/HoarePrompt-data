The function processes a series of input pairs consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s`. For each pair, if `n` is 2, it checks if `s` equals '00'; otherwise, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. If the count is odd or if the count is 2 with exactly one occurrence of '11', it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs based on the given conditions.
