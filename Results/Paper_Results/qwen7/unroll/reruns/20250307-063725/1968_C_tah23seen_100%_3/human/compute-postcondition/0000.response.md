Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range [1, 500], and ans is a list of n integers where each integer is 10^9.**

Explanation: The code initializes `ans` as a list of `n` elements, where each element is set to `10 ** 9`. The length of `ans` is `n`, and the initial state of `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a list of `n-1` integers within the specified range, while `ans` is a new list of `n` integers, each equal to `10 ** 9`.
