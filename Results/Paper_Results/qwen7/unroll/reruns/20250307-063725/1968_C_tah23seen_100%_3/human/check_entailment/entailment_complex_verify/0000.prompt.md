You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range [1, 500], and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: The list `ans` will be modified such that for every index `i` from 0 to n-2, `ans[i]` will hold the value obtained by subtracting the sum of `arr[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-2` from `ans[i+1]`. The first element `ans[0]` will be `ans[1] - arr[0]`, and so on until the last element `ans[n-2]` which will be `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`. After the function concludes, the list `ans` contains values derived from the original list `arr` according to the specified formula.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Let's consider the following example:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2\)
- \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4\)
- \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1\)

However, the current implementation generates `a` as follows:
- `ans = [10 ** 9] * n`
- `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`

This approach does not guarantee that the generated `a` will satisfy the required modulo conditions. For instance, if we start with `a_3 = 5`, `a_2 = 14`, and `a_1 = 16`, the conditions are satisfied:
- \(14 \bmod 16 = 14\) (not 4)
- \(5 \bmod 14 = 5\) (not 2)

Thus, the program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases.
