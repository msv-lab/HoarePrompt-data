Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed. Let's consider the following example:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2\)
- \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4\)
- \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1\)

However, the current implementation generates `a` as follows:
- `ans = [10 ** 9] * n`
- `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`

This approach does not guarantee that the generated `a` will satisfy the required modulo conditions. For instance, if we start with `a_3 = 5`, `a_2 = 14`, and `a_1 = 16`, the conditions are satisfied:
- \(14 \bmod 16 = 14\) (not 4)
- \(5 \bmod 14 = 5\) (not 2)

Thus, the program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases.
