You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range [1, 500], and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: The list `ans` will be modified such that for every index `i` from 0 to n-2, `ans[i]` will hold the value obtained by subtracting the sum of `arr[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-2` from `ans[i+1]`. The first element `ans[0]` will be `ans[1] - arr[0]`, and so on until the last element `ans[n-2]` which will be `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
