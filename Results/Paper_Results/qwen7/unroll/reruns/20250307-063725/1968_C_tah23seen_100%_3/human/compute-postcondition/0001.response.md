Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range [1, 500], and `ans` is a list of n integers where each integer is 10^9; `i` is n - 2.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value `n - 2` to the variable `i`. The lists `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `i` and retains the original descriptions of `arr` and `ans`.
