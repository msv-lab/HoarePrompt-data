Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`.**

This means that the program constructs the list `ans` by iterating through the list `arr` and applying the specified formula to each element, starting from the first element and moving towards the second last element of the list.
