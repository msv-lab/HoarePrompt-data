Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided function `func_1` attempts to construct such an array by setting \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\) for \(i\) from \(n-2\) down to \(0\). This approach ensures that \(a_i \geq a_{i+1} - x_i\), which can satisfy the modulo condition since \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).
3. The function initializes `ans` with a large value (`10^9`) and then iteratively sets each element based on the previous element and the corresponding value in `arr`.
4. The function correctly handles the constraints and the problem requirements by ensuring that each \(a_i\) is at least as large as necessary to satisfy the modulo condition.

Given the logic and the steps taken by the function, it appears that the function correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the provided function should produce the correct output for the given problem constraints.

Correctness: **True**
