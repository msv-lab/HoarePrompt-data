Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by defining a function `func_1` that calculates the array `ans` based on the given logic.
2. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly implement the required conditions. Specifically, the formula used in the function does not align with the problem statement.
3. According to the problem, `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`. This means that for each `x_i`, we need to find an `a_i` such that when `a_i` is divided by `a_{i-1}`, the remainder is `x_i`.
4. The current implementation in `func_1` does not ensure that the calculated `ans[i]` will satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. Instead, it seems to be subtracting the cumulative sum of `arr` from `ans[i+1]`, which is not relevant to the modulo operation required by the problem.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
