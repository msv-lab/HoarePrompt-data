Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the calculation of `ans[i]` should ensure that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true. However, the current implementation sets `ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be satisfied.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `a_i` is chosen such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. A correct approach would be to set `a_i` to be `a_{i-1} + x_i`. This ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.

Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    ans[n - 1] = 1  # Initialize the last element to 1
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] + arr[i]
    return ans
```

With this correction, the program should work as expected.
