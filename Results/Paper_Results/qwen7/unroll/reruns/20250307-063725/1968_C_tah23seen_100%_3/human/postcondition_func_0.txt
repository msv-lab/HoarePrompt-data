The function accepts a list `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`. After the function concludes, the list `ans` contains values derived from the original list `arr` according to the specified formula.
