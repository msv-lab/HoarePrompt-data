#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500) where each integer is in the range [1, 500], and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: The list `ans` will be modified such that for every index `i` from 0 to n-2, `ans[i]` will hold the value obtained by subtracting the sum of `arr[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-2` from `ans[i+1]`. The first element `ans[0]` will be `ans[1] - arr[0]`, and so on until the last element `ans[n-2]` which will be `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` and an integer `n`. It returns a list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` (for i from 0 to n-2) is calculated as `ans[i+1] - sum(arr[j] for j in range(i, n-1))`. The first element `ans[0]` is specifically `ans[1] - arr[0]`. After the function concludes, the list `ans` contains values derived from the original list `arr` according to the specified formula.
