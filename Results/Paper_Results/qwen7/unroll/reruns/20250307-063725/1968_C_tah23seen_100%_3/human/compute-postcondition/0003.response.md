Output State: **The list `ans` will be modified such that for every index `i` from 0 to n-2, `ans[i]` will hold the value obtained by subtracting the sum of `arr[j]` for all `j` from `i` to `n-2` from `ans[i+1]`. The first element `ans[0]` will be `ans[1] - arr[0]`, and so on until the last element `ans[n-2]` which will be `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]`.**

To break it down further with an example:
If `arr = [3, 5, 7]` and `ans = [1000000000, 1000000000, 1000000000]`, after the loop:
- `ans[0] = ans[1] - arr[0] = 1000000000 - 3 = 999999997`
- `ans[1] = ans[2] - arr[1] = 1000000000 - 5 = 999999995`
- `ans[2] = 1000000000 - 7 = 999999993`

So, the final `ans` would be `[999999997, 999999995, 999999993]`.
