Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.**

The provided code is a docstring for a decorator and does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.
