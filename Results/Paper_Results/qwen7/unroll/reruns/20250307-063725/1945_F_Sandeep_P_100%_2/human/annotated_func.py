#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of integers representing the magic powers of the mushrooms, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. Instead, it defines a decorator named `decorating_function` which is returned when called. The purpose of this decorator is to modify the behavior of another function (not shown in the provided code) such that if a recursive call to `repr` is made, it will return a specified `fillvalue` instead of causing an error.
