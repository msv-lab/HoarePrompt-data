You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each being "x - 2", where "x" is the value of the variable "x" provided in each iteration of the loop.
        #
        #Explanation: In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from user input, but these values do not affect the final output. The array `arr` is also populated with some integers based on the value of `x`, but again, these details do not influence the final output. The only operation that produces output is `print(x - 2)`, which prints `x - 2` for each iteration. Since the loop continues until `t` becomes 0, the number of times this print statement is executed is equal to the initial value of `t`. Therefore, the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing an integer that is `x - 2` from the corresponding iteration.
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each containing the value `x - 2` from the corresponding iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes n, x, and y (with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0). The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs, where the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
