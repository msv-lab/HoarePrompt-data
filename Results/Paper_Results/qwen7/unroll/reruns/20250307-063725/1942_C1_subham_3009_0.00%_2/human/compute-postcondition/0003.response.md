Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing `-1`.

Explanation: The given code repeatedly reads input values but does not depend on these inputs for its output. Specifically, the line `print(x - 2)` always prints `x - 2`. Since `[n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())` sets `x` to an integer value from the input, and `arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]` creates a list of integers based on `x`, the final operation `print(x - 2)` will print `x - 2` for each iteration. Given that `t` starts as a positive integer and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, the loop will run `t` times. Therefore, there will be `t` lines of output, each displaying `x - 2`, where `x` is an integer from the input. Since `x - 2` will generally be a negative number (as `x` is at least 1), the output will be `-1` repeated `t` times.
