You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

def func():

        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            print(x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads additional integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case, resulting in `t` lines of output, each containing the value `x - 2`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Processing**:
   - The program immediately prints `x - 2` without any further processing.

3. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - Given `x` chosen vertices, we need to determine how many additional vertices we can choose (up to `y`) to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The key insight is that a polygon with `k` vertices can be divided into `k-2` triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.

4. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program simply prints `x - 2`, which is the number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices alone.
   - This does not account for the additional vertices that can be chosen (up to `y`), nor does it consider the total number of vertices `n`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - If `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `x - 2`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `y > 0` and there are enough remaining vertices to form additional triangles.
   - The program does not consider the total number of vertices `n` and the fact that additional vertices can potentially increase the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming additional triangles using the extra vertices (`y` additional vertices). The solution should consider the total number of vertices and the number of additional vertices available to maximize the number of triangles.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
