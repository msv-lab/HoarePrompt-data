Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads additional integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case, resulting in `t` lines of output, each containing the value `x - 2`.**
