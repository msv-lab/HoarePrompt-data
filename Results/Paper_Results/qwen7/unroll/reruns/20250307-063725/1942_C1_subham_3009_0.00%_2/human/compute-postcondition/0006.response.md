Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes n, x, and y (with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0). The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on these inputs, where the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.**
