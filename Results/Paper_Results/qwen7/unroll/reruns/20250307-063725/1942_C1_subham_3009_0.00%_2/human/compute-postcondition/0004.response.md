Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each being "x - 2", where "x" is the value of the variable "x" provided in each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from user input, but these values do not affect the final output. The array `arr` is also populated with some integers based on the value of `x`, but again, these details do not influence the final output. The only operation that produces output is `print(x - 2)`, which prints `x - 2` for each iteration. Since the loop continues until `t` becomes 0, the number of times this print statement is executed is equal to the initial value of `t`. Therefore, the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing an integer that is `x - 2` from the corresponding iteration.
