Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the `print(x - 2)` statement is incorrect. The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed. Given `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed without adding any additional vertices (`y = 0`) is actually `x - 2`. However, the program should not directly subtract 2 from `x` because the logic for forming triangles needs to consider the structure of the polygon and the chosen vertices.

For a polygon with `n` sides and `x` chosen vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `x - 2` when `y = 0`, but the program should handle this correctly based on the problem constraints and the nature of the polygon. The current implementation does not properly account for the polygon's structure and the fact that the chosen vertices might not necessarily form a maximal set of triangles.

To correctly solve this, one would need to ensure that the chosen vertices indeed allow for the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles, which involves more complex logic considering the connectivity and arrangement of the vertices.
