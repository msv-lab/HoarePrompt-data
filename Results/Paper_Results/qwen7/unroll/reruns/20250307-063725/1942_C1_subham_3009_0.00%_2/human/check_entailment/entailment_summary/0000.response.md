Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
2. Given that Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices and we can add up to `y` more vertices, the key observation is that any set of `x + y` vertices can form at most `x + y - 2` triangles.
3. Since `y = 0` in this version of the problem, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices is `x - 2`.
4. The provided program correctly implements this logic by printing `x - 2` for each test case.

Given these points, the program is indeed correct according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
