Let's analyze the given program to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It then reads `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Processing**:
   - The program immediately prints `x - 2` without any further processing.

3. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - Given `x` chosen vertices, we need to determine how many additional vertices we can choose (up to `y`) to maximize the number of triangles.
   - The key insight is that a polygon with `k` vertices can be divided into `k-2` triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.

4. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program simply prints `x - 2`, which is the number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices alone.
   - This does not account for the additional vertices that can be chosen (up to `y`), nor does it consider the total number of vertices `n`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - If `y = 0`, the program correctly outputs `x - 2`.
   - However, the program does not handle the case where `y > 0` and there are enough remaining vertices to form additional triangles.
   - The program does not consider the total number of vertices `n` and the fact that additional vertices can potentially increase the number of triangles.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of forming additional triangles using the extra vertices (`y` additional vertices). The solution should consider the total number of vertices and the number of additional vertices available to maximize the number of triangles.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
