# Problem:

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0. The vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    if (__name__ == '__main__') :
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            
            arr = input().split()
            
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            
            print(x - 2)
            
        #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each being "x - 2", where "x" is the value of the variable "x" provided in each iteration of the loop.
        #
        #Explanation: In each iteration of the while loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from user input, but these values do not affect the final output. The array `arr` is also populated with some integers based on the value of `x`, but again, these details do not influence the final output. The only operation that produces output is `print(x - 2)`, which prints `x - 2` for each iteration. Since the loop continues until `t` becomes 0, the number of times this print statement is executed is equal to the initial value of `t`. Therefore, the output will consist of `t` lines, each containing an integer that is `x - 2` from the corresponding iteration.
    #State: The output consists of `t` lines, each containing the value `x - 2` from the corresponding iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it reads additional integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (with 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0), and a list of `x` distinct integers representing vertices. The function then prints `x - 2` for each test case, resulting in `t` lines of output, each containing the value `x - 2`.
