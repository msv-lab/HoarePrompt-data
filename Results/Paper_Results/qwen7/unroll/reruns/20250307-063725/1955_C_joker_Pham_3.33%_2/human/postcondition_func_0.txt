The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the length of the list `a`), `k` (a non-negative integer), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It modifies the list `a` by performing specific operations based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` within a while loop. The function counts the number of times certain conditions are met during the loop's execution and returns this count, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.
