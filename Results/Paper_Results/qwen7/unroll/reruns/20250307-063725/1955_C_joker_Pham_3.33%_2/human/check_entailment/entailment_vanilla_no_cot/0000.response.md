Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Durabilities**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly simulate the attack sequence. Specifically, when a ship's durability reaches zero, it should be removed from consideration for future attacks. However, the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Reducing Durabilities**: The logic for reducing the durability of ships during attacks is flawed. For instance, when the Kraken attacks the first or last ship, the durability of the next/previous ship should be adjusted accordingly, but the current code does not do this properly.

3. **Break Conditions**: The conditions under which the loop breaks are not correctly implemented. For example, the condition `if k >= a[l] * 2` and similar checks do not fully capture the logic needed to simulate the Kraken's attacks accurately.

4. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: There are edge cases where the program might not behave as expected, such as when multiple ships sink in a single attack cycle.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, we need to keep track of the remaining ships and their durabilities in a way that reflects the alternating pattern of attacks. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Initialize indices for first and last ship
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    
    while l <= r and k > 0:
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[l]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        
        if k >= a[l]:
            k -= a[l]
            a[l] = 0
            sunks += 1
            l += 1
        else:
            a[l] -= k
            k = 0
        
        if k > 0 and l <= r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                a[r] = 0
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                a[r] -= k
                k = 0
    
    print(sunks)
```

This corrected version ensures that the durability of ships is reduced correctly and handles the alternating pattern of attacks properly.
