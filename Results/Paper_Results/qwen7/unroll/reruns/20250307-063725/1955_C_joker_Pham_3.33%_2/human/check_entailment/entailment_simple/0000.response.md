Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to simulate the attacks by the Kraken on the ships.
2. The function `func_1` iteratively checks the durability of the first and last ships and reduces their durability accordingly until they sink.
3. The logic handles the special case where both the first and last ships have the same durability.
4. The function correctly breaks out of the loop when there are no more attacks (`k == 0`) or when the remaining durability of the current ship being checked is less than the remaining attacks.
5. The function correctly updates the indices `l` and `r` to skip over ships that have already sunk.
6. The final count of sunk ships is returned accurately.

Given the logic and the implementation, the function `func_1` appears to correctly simulate the described scenario and calculate the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
