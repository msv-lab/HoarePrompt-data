Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; `a` is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all elements a_i in the list, and the length of the list is equal to n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1; `sunks` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sunks` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
