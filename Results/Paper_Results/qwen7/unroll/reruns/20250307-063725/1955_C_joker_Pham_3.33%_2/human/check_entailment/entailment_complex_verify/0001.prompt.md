You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: The list `a` is modified according to the operations performed within the loop, `l` and `r` are updated to reflect the indices being processed, and `sunks` counts the number of times certain conditions are met during the loop's execution.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the number of times certain conditions were met during the loop's execution, which is represented by the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n` (the length of the list `a`), `k` (a non-negative integer), and `a` (a list of positive integers). It modifies the list `a` by performing specific operations based on the values of `a[l]` and `a[r]` within a while loop. The function counts the number of times certain conditions are met during the loop's execution and returns this count, which is stored in the variable `sunks`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variables Initialization**: The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` are correctly initialized from the input. However, there is a mistake in the way `a` is processed. The `map(int, input().split())` should be converted to a list before passing it to `func_1`.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - The logic inside the loop is mostly correct but needs some adjustments:
     - When attacking the first ship (`l`), it checks if the durability is enough to sink the ship and then moves the pointer `l` forward.
     - When attacking the last ship (`r`), it checks if the durability is enough to sink the ship and then moves the pointer `r` backward.
     - The logic handles the case where the durability of the first and last ships is equal and the remaining attacks are insufficient to sink them.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the durability of the first and last ships is the same and the remaining attacks are insufficient.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the durability of the first or last ship is less than the remaining attacks.
5. **Output**: The function returns the correct number of sunk ships for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is mostly correct, with the exception of the way `a` is processed. The `map` function returns an iterator, which needs to be converted to a list before being passed to `func_1`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))

def func_1(n, k, a):
    (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break
            break
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l] * 2:
                k -= a[l] * 2
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                sunks += 1
                l += 1
                continue
            elif a[l] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
                break
        if k == 0:
            break
        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]

            elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1
                break
            else:
