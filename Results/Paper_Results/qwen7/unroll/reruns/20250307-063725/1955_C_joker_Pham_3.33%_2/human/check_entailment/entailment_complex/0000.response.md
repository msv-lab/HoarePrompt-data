Reasoning:
1. The problem description and the annotated program both accurately describe the behavior of the Kraken's attacks and the counting of sunk ships.
2. The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
3. The conditions for sinking a ship when its durability reaches zero are correctly implemented.
4. The while loop properly iterates through the attacks until `k` becomes zero or there are no more ships left to attack.
5. The function correctly updates the indices `l` and `r` and the `sunks` counter based on the remaining durability of the ships.
6. The final return value of `sunks` is the correct number of ships that were sunk.

Given these points, the implementation in the function `func_1` matches the problem requirements and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
