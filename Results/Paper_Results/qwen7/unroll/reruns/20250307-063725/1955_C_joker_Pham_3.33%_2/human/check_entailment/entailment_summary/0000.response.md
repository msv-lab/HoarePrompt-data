Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic and behavior of the `func_1` function against the problem statement and the given example.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly initializes pointers `l` and `r` to the start and end of the list `a`, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of ships sunk.

2. **Loop Logic:**
   - The while loop continues as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - Inside the loop, the function checks if `k` is zero, breaking the loop if true.
   - If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`). If so, it increments `sunks` and breaks the loop, otherwise, it breaks without incrementing `sunks`.

3. **Attack Logic:**
   - The function alternates between attacking the first and last ships based on their durability.
   - If the durability of the first ship (`a[l]`) is less than or equal to the durability of the last ship (`a[r]`), it performs attacks on the first ship until its durability is reduced to zero or `k` is exhausted.
   - Similarly, if the durability of the last ship is less than the first ship, it performs attacks on the last ship until its durability is reduced to zero or `k` is exhausted.
   - After each attack, it updates the `sunks` counter and adjusts the pointers accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the edge case where the first and last ships have the same durability and `k` is exactly equal to the durability of either ship, ensuring the correct number of ships are sunk.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of ships sunk, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately simulates the attacks performed by the Kraken and correctly counts the number of ships sunk.

Correctness: **True**
