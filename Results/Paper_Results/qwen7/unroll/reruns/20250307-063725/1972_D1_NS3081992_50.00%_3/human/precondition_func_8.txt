There is no input parameter for the function, and it is expected to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, where 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6, and the function should output the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) for each test case.
