Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) such that the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function returns a result based on the processing of these test cases.**

This means the function `func_16` indirectly accepts a series of test cases through its implied logic, where each test case includes an integer `t` and pairs of integers `n` and `m`. The function processes these values according to certain rules and returns a result based on the given constraints.
