Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d` containing only 0s and 1s, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d` initialized to 0s. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each unprocessed neighbor of `da` (indicated by `processing[di - 1] == 0`), updating `tmp` to the minimum value of these recursive calls. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.

#Function 13:

def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, g
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not being zero) and returns either (1, 0, a) or (y, x - a // b * y, g). If `b` is zero, it directly returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `(b, a % b)` and uses the returned values to compute and return (y, x - a // b * y, g).

#Function 14:

    #State: k is reduced by the sum of (m - a[i]) for all i in the range of n where a[i] is less than m, and k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, reducing `k` by the difference between `m` and each element of `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to zero after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:

    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
    #
    #To understand this output state more clearly, let's break down what the loop does:
    #
    #- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
    #- It continues to increment `i` by 1 until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
    #- In each iteration, it adds the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\) to `ans`.
    #
    #For example, if \(n = 3\), the loop will execute as follows:
    #- When \(i = 1\): \(1^2 \leq 3 + 1\) is true, so \((3 + 1) // 1^2 = 4 // 1 = 4\) is added to `ans`.
    #- When \(i = 2\): \(2^2 \leq 3 + 2\) is false, so the loop terminates.
    #
    #Thus, `ans` would be 4 in this case.
    #
    #The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but generally, `ans` accumulates the integer division results for all valid `i` values.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans` minus 1, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\), and then returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: t test cases are executed, and for each test case, the value returned by func_15() is written to stdout on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls `func_15()` t times and writes the result of each call to standard output on a new line. The function does not return any value but outputs the results of `func_15()` for each test case.
