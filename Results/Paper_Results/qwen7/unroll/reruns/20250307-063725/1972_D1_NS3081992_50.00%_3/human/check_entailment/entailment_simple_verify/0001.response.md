### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes various utility functions for reading input and handling arrays, but none of these functions directly address the problem statement.
   - The function `func_15()` is the only one that attempts to solve the problem, but its implementation is incorrect.

3. **Relevant Functions**:
   - **func_15()**: This function is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). However, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply counts how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
   - **func_16()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` is flawed. The function does not check the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counts how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.
   - The function should iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The function `func_15()` does not address the core requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not check the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
