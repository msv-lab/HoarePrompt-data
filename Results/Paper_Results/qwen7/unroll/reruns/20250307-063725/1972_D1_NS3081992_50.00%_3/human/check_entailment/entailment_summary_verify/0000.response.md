### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and compare it with the problem description.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes several utility functions for reading input, such as `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, etc., which are used to read integers and lists of integers from standard input.
   - There is a function `func_15()` which seems to be the main function intended to solve the problem. It calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The function `func_16()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.

3. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - This function takes no parameters and directly returns the result of another function call `func_15()`. This is likely a typo or placeholder, as the function name is repeated.
   - The actual implementation of `func_15()` is missing in the provided code snippet. However, based on the problem description, we can infer that it should calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

4. **Function `func_15()` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_15()` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs. Given the problem constraints and the example provided, the function should iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided code snippet for `func_15()` does not contain the actual logic to solve the problem. Instead, it has some unrelated code that seems to be calculating something else.

5. **Correctness of the Provided Code**:
   - The provided code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. The function `func_15()` is incomplete and does not implement the required functionality.
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the provided code does not solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem.

**Final: False**
