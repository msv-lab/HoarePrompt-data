Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.**

Explanation:
- `func_16` is a function that iterates over a number of test cases specified by `func_10()`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_15()` which presumably calculates the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) as described in the problem statement.
- The result of `func_15()` is written to standard output followed by a newline character.
