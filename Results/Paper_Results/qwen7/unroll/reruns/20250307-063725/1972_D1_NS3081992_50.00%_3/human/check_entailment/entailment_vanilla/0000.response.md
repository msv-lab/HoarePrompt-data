### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement.
   - Instead, it includes various utility functions like reading input, handling arrays, and some mathematical operations, but none of these functions are used to solve the specific problem at hand.

3. **Relevant Functions**:
   - **func_15()**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counts how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\).
   - **func_16()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` is flawed. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
   - The function instead checks how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The function `func_15()` does not address the core requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness: **False**
