The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, reducing `k` by the difference between `m` and each element of `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to zero after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
