### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several utility functions for reading input and handling arrays, but the primary functions relevant to solving the problem are `func_15()` and `func_16()`.
   - `func_15()` is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - `func_16()` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

3. **Relevant Functions**:
   - **func_15()**: This function attempts to count the number of valid pairs by iterating from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counting how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\). However, this logic is incorrect because it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - **func_16()**: This function correctly processes the test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` is indeed flawed. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
   - The function instead checks how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_15()` does not perform this check and thus provides incorrect results.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The function `func_15()` does not address the core requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
