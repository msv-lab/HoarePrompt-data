You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
    #
    #To understand this output state more clearly, let's break down what the loop does:
    #
    #- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
    #- It continues to increment `i` by 1 until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
    #- In each iteration, it adds the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\) to `ans`.
    #
    #For example, if \(n = 3\), the loop will execute as follows:
    #- When \(i = 1\): \(1^2 \leq 3 + 1\) is true, so \((3 + 1) // 1^2 = 4 // 1 = 4\) is added to `ans`.
    #- When \(i = 2\): \(2^2 \leq 3 + 2\) is false, so the loop terminates.
    #
    #Thus, `ans` would be 4 in this case.
    #
    #The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but generally, `ans` accumulates the integer division results for all valid `i` values.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the value of `ans` minus 1, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function calculates the sum of (n + i) divided by i^2 for all integers i from 1 up to but not exceeding the square root of (n + i), and then returns this sum minus 1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `ans` minus 1, where `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
