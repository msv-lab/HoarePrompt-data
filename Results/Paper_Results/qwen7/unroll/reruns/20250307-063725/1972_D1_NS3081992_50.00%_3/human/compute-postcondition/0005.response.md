Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).

To understand this output state more clearly, let's break down what the loop does:

- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
- It continues to increment `i` by 1 until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
- In each iteration, it adds the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\) to `ans`.

For example, if \(n = 3\), the loop will execute as follows:
- When \(i = 1\): \(1^2 \leq 3 + 1\) is true, so \((3 + 1) // 1^2 = 4 // 1 = 4\) is added to `ans`.
- When \(i = 2\): \(2^2 \leq 3 + 2\) is false, so the loop terminates.

Thus, `ans` would be 4 in this case.

The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but generally, `ans` accumulates the integer division results for all valid `i` values.
