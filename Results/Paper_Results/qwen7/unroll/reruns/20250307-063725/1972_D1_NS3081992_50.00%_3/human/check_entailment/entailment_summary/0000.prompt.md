Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input, which must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and returns this integer.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads integers from the standard input buffer, splits them by spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from standard input and returns them as a list `[n, m]`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` (with a constraint of 1 <= `rows_number` <= 10^4) and returns a list. This list contains the result of calling another function `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing newline characters, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a single line of space-separated integers from standard input, representing the number of test cases 't', followed by 't' pairs of integers 'n' and 'm'. It then returns a string containing this input.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a single input string, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers. This process is performed regardless of the content or length of the input string, as long as it adheres to the expected format.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `rows` representing the number of test cases. It generates a list containing the result of calling `func_7()` for each of the specified number of test cases. The final state of the program is that it returns this list.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates and returns the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer input from the user and returns it.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads input data consisting of `t`, `n`, and `m` values for multiple test cases, splits these values into strings, and returns a list of these strings. Each string in the list contains the values of `t`, `n`, and `m` for a single test case.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d` containing only 0s and 1s, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d` initialized to 0s. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each unprocessed neighbor of `da` (indicated by `processing[di - 1] == 0`), updating `tmp` to the minimum value of these recursive calls. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (with `b` not being zero) and returns either (1, 0, a) or (y, x - a // b * y, g). If `b` is zero, it directly returns (1, 0, a). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `(b, a % b)` and uses the returned values to compute and return (y, x - a // b * y, g).
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, reducing `k` by the difference between `m` and each element of `a` that is less than `m`. If `k` is greater than or equal to zero after this process, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function calculates the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\), and then returns this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls `func_15()` t times and writes the result of each call to standard output on a new line. The function does not return any value but outputs the results of `func_15()` for each test case.
