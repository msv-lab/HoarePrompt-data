Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any logic to solve this specific problem. Instead, the functions seem to be utility functions for reading input and do not contribute to solving the actual problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 3)\). The output should be `3`.

However, the provided code does not contain any logic to compute these pairs. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
