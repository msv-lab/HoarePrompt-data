Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only variable involved here is `func_10()`, which returns an integer value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute based on the return value of `func_10()`. This means we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since `range` expects a non-negative integer).
   - We don't know the exact value returned by `func_10()`, but we need to ensure that it is a valid number of iterations for the loop to execute.

3. **Consider the Constraints**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means there are up to \(10^4\) test cases.
   - For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), and the sum of `n` or `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

Given these constraints, the function `func_10()` should return a value that is within the bounds of the number of test cases. Since the maximum number of test cases is \(10^4\), `func_10()` should return a value between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- Ensure that `func_10()` returns a value between 1 and \(10^4\).

Since the initial state does not provide information about `func_10()`, we need to ensure that the function call `func_10()` returns a valid number of iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`func_10()` must return a value between 1 and \(10^4\)**
