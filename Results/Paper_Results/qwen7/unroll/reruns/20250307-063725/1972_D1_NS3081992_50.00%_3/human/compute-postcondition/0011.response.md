Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d` containing only 0s and 1s, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d` initialized to 0s. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, it returns 1. Otherwise, it recursively processes each unprocessed neighbor of `da` (indicated by `processing[di - 1] == 0`), updating `tmp` to the minimum value of these recursive calls. Finally, it sets `rank[da - 1]` to `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.**
