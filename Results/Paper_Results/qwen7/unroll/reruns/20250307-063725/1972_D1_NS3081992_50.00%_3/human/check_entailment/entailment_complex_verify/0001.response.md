### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes several utility functions for reading input, handling arrays, and performing mathematical operations, but none of these functions directly address the problem's requirements.
   - The primary relevant function is `func_15()`, which attempts to count the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Relevant Functions**:
   - **func_15()**: This function iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counts how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\). This is a simplified and incorrect approach to solving the problem.
   - **func_16()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` is indeed flawed. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
   - The function instead checks how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.
   - To correctly solve the problem, one needs to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The function `func_15()` does not address the core requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
