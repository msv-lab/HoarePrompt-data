Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The given solution consists of several functions, but the primary logic seems to be implemented in `func_15()`.
- `func_16()` is responsible for reading the input and calling `func_15()` for each test case.
- `func_15()` is supposed to calculate the required number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

Let's analyze `func_15()`:
- It calculates \((n + i) / (i^2)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to but not exceeding \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
- The sum of these values is then returned, minus 1.

However, the logic in `func_15()` does not seem to correctly implement the problem statement. The problem requires checking each pair (a, b) and verifying the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), which is not what `func_15()` does.

Given that `func_15()` does not correctly implement the required logic, the overall program will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
