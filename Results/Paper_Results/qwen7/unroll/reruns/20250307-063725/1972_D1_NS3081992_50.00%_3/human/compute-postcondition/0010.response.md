Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of the same length as the maximum key in `d` containing only 0s and 1s, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d` initialized to 0s. It returns 1 if certain conditions are met, otherwise, it returns the value of `tmp` plus 1, where `tmp` is the minimum value of `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` is 0.**
