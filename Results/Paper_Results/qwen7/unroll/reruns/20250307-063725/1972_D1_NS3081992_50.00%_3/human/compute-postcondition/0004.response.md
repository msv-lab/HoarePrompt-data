Output State: The value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 up to the largest integer such that \(i^2 \leq n + i\).

To understand this better, let's break it down:

- For each \(i\) starting from 1, as long as \(i^2 \leq n + i\), we add \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) to `ans`.
- This means that `ans` accumulates the sum of these fractions until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
- Once \(i^2\) becomes greater than \(n + i\), the loop terminates.

The exact numerical value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but the process described above will determine its final state after the loop completes.
