Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` and its usage within `func_16` do not address the core requirements of the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Current Implementation**: The current implementation of `func_15` and `func_16` does not involve any logic related to the gcd condition or the multiple condition specified in the problem statement. Instead, it seems to be attempting a different kind of calculation, possibly involving the divisors of numbers up to \(n + i\).

3. **Missing Core Logic**: There is no code that iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks whether they satisfy the given condition. The gcd calculation and the multiple check are crucial parts of the solution, which are missing from the current implementation.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges.
- For each pair \((a, b)\), calculate \(\gcd(a, b)\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

Here is a more appropriate approach to solving the problem:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        n, m = func_7()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Example usage:
# func_16()
```

This approach directly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.
