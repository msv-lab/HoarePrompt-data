Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve the given problem by reading input, processing it, and writing the output to the standard output.
- The main function `func_16` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by calling `func_15`.
- `func_15` calculates the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case \((n, m)\) using the formula derived from the problem constraints.
- The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) seem to be utility functions that read input in various forms, but they are not used in the main logic of the program.
- The function `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.
- The overall structure of the program is correct, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct based on the provided information.

Correctness: **True**
