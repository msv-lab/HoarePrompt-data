Reasoning:
- The main function `func_16` reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input and then processes each test case by calling `func_15` t times.
- `func_15` calculates the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) for a given pair of integers (n, m) where 1 ≤ a ≤ n and 1 ≤ b ≤ m, and a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
- The calculation in `func_15` involves iterating over possible values of `i` and checking the condition for each pair (a, b).
- The logic in `func_15` correctly counts the number of valid pairs for a given (n, m) by considering the condition a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
- The overall structure of the program is designed to handle multiple test cases efficiently, and the functions are used appropriately to achieve the desired outcome.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the provided execution states.
