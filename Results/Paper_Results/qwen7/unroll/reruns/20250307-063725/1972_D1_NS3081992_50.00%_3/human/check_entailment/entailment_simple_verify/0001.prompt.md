You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
    #- It continues to increment `i` by 1 until \(i^2\) exceeds \(n + i\).
    #- In each iteration, it adds the integer division of \((n + i)\) by \(i^2\) to `ans`.
    #
    #For example, if \(n = 3\), the loop will execute as follows:
    #- When \(i = 1\): \(1^2 \leq 3 + 1\) is true, so \((3 + 1) // 1^2 = 4 // 1 = 4\) is added to `ans`.
    #- When \(i = 2\): \(2^2 \leq 3 + 2\) is false, so the loop terminates.
    #
    #Thus, `ans` would be 4 in this case.

    #The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but generally, `ans` accumulates the integer division results for all valid `i` values.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement.
   - Instead, it includes various utility functions like reading input, handling arrays, and some mathematical operations, but none of these functions are used to solve the specific problem at hand.

3. **Relevant Functions**:
   - **func_15()**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and counts how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\).
   - **func_16()**: This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15()` for each test case.

4. **Correctness of `func_15()`**:
   - The logic in `func_15()` is flawed. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not checked.
   - The function instead checks how many times \((n + i)\) is divisible by \(i^2\), which is unrelated to the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The function `func_15()` does not address the core requirement of checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Correctness: **False**
