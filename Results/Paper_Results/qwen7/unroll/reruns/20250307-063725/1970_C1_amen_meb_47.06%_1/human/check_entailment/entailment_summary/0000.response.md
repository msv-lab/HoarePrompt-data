Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**: 
   - The function `func_1()` is designed to read pairs of integers from the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
   - However, the problem statement does not mention reading input from the user. Instead, it provides the edges of the tree directly in the input format. Therefore, `func_1()` is not needed for the given problem and should be removed or modified to fit the problem's input format.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program logic seems to be trying to compare some values (`num_1` and `num_2`) from the `result` list to count the number of times `Ron_co` and `Hermione_co` win.
   - However, the `result` list is never defined or populated in the provided code. The program is trying to access `result`, which is not initialized, leading to an error.

3. **Input Handling**:
   - The problem specifies that the input will be pre-defined and not read from user input. The program should directly use the input data provided in the problem statement.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect because it tries to read input from the user through `func_1()`, which is unnecessary, and the `result` variable is not defined or populated correctly.

Correctness: **False**
