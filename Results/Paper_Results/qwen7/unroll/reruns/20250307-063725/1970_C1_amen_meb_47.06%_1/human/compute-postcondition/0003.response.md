Output State: The `numbers` list will contain all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.

Explanation: The loop continues to run indefinitely (`while True`) until it encounters a line of input that does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers. Each valid line of input is split into two integers, which are then appended as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Therefore, the final state of `numbers` will be a list of all such pairs entered by the user before an invalid input is provided.
