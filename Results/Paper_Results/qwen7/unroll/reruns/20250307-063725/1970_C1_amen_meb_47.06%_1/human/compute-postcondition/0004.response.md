Output State: **The program returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.**

This means the program collects pairs of integers from the user in a list until the user inputs a line that doesn't consist of exactly two space-separated integers. Each valid pair is appended as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. The final list returned contains all these pairs up to the point where an invalid input was given.
