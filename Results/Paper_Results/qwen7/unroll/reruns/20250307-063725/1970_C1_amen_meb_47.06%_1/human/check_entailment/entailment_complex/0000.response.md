Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is designed to read pairs of integers from the standard input until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
   - However, the problem statement specifies that the input format should be pre-defined and fixed (i.e., `n-1` lines of edges for the tree and one line of starting nodes), but the function `func_1()` does not match this format. Instead, it reads input indefinitely until an invalid line is encountered, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program expects `func_1()` to return a list of pairs representing the edges of the tree and the starting nodes.
   - The logic in the main program counts how many times Ron and Hermione would win based on the comparison of the first elements of the returned pairs from `func_1()`.
   - Given the current implementation of `func_1()`, it will not correctly read the required input format and will instead enter an infinite loop waiting for invalid input, leading to incorrect behavior.

Given these points, the function `func_1()` does not meet the requirements specified in the problem statement, and the overall program will not function as intended.

Correctness: **False**
