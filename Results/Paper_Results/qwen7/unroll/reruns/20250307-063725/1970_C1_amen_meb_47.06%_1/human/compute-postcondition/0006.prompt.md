You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains t integers such that 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: Output State: The `numbers` list will contain all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to run indefinitely (`while True`) until it encounters a line of input that does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers. Each valid line of input is split into two integers, which are then appended as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Therefore, the final state of `numbers` will be a list of all such pairs entered by the user before an invalid input is provided.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
