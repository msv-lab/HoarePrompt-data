You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains t integers such that 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n.

    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:

        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: Output State: The `numbers` list will contain all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to run indefinitely (`while True`) until it encounters a line of input that does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers. Each valid line of input is split into two integers, which are then appended as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Therefore, the final state of `numbers` will be a list of all such pairs entered by the user before an invalid input is provided.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` is designed to read pairs of numbers from input, but the problem does not require reading input during runtime. Instead, the input is provided as part of the problem statement, and the program should determine the winner based on the structure of the tree and the initial node for each round.

The program reads input using `input().split()`, which is not aligned with the problem description, where the input is already provided as part of the test cases. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1()` and the main program does not reflect the game rules or the structure of the tree.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Parse the input to build the tree structure.
2. Determine the winner based on the structure of the tree and the initial node for each round, considering the optimal moves for both players.

Since the provided program does not follow the problem description and does not correctly implement the game logic, it is incorrect.
