Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains t integers such that 1 ≤ u_1, ..., u_t ≤ n.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: Output State: The `numbers` list will contain all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to run indefinitely (`while True`) until it encounters a line of input that does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers. Each valid line of input is split into two integers, which are then appended as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Therefore, the final state of `numbers` will be a list of all such pairs entered by the user before an invalid input is provided.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered. The function reads input from the user repeatedly, splits each line into two integers, and appends them as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. The process continues until a line of input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers, at which point the function returns the accumulated list of pairs.
