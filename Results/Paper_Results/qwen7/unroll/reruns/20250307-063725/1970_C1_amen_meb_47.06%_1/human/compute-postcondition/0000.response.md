Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list `numbers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `numbers`. Since `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` were defined before the code execution and their values did not change, they remain the same.
