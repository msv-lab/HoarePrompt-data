The function accepts no parameters and returns a list of all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered by the user until a line with less than 2 elements is entered. The function reads input from the user repeatedly, splits each line into two integers, and appends them as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. The process continues until a line of input does not consist of exactly two space-separated integers, at which point the function returns the accumulated list of pairs.
