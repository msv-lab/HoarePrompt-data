Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1()` is designed to read pairs of numbers from input, but the problem does not require reading input during runtime. Instead, the input is provided as part of the problem statement, and the program should determine the winner based on the structure of the tree and the initial node for each round.

The program reads input using `input().split()`, which is not aligned with the problem description, where the input is already provided as part of the test cases. Additionally, the logic inside `func_1()` and the main program does not reflect the game rules or the structure of the tree.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should:
1. Parse the input to build the tree structure.
2. Determine the winner based on the structure of the tree and the initial node for each round, considering the optimal moves for both players.

Since the provided program does not follow the problem description and does not correctly implement the game logic, it is incorrect.
