Since the `while True` loop runs indefinitely unless explicitly stopped, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute the first time. The loop will always execute at least once because it is a `while True` loop.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list `numbers` is an empty list**
