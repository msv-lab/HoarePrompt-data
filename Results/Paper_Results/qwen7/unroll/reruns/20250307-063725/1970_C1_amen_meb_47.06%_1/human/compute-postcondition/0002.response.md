Output State: The list `numbers` contains pairs of integers [num1, num2] entered by the user until a line with less than 2 numbers is entered.

Explanation: The loop continues to read lines from the input until it encounters a line that does not contain exactly two integers. Each valid line is split into two integers, which are then appended as a list `[num1, num2]` to the `numbers` list. Once an invalid line (with less than two numbers) is encountered, the loop breaks, and no further additions are made to the `numbers` list.
