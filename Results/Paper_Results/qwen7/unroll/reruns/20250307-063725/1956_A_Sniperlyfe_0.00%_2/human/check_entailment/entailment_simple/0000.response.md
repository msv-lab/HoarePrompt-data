### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players from a game until no more players can be kicked out in a round.
   - The variable `n` represents the number of players remaining in the game.
   - The list `p` contains the positions (indices) of players who are to be kicked out in each round.
   - The loop in `func_1` continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`.
   - In each iteration, `n` is decreased by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - This process simulates the removal of players in each round of the game.
   - The function returns `n` after the loop terminates, which should be 0 if all players have been removed, or a positive integer if some players remain.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2()` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k` and `q`, the list `p`, and the list `qs`.
   - It then iterates over each `n` in `qs` and calls `func_1(n, p)` to determine the number of players remaining after the game.
   - The results are stored in a list `res` and printed at the end of each test case.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game's process of removing players.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and prints the results.
   - The program handles the input and output as specified in the problem description.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the described game rules.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
