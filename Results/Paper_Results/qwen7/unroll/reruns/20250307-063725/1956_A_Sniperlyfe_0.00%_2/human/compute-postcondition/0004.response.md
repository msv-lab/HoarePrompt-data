Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases (determined by the variable `t`). For each test case, it reads two positive integers `k` and `q`, followed by a list `p` of `k` sorted positive integers and a list `qs` of `q` positive integers. It then calls another function `func_1` for each element in `qs`, checking if each element is present in `p`. The results are stored in a list `res` and printed for each test case, forming a series of lines, each containing `q` space-separated boolean values indicating the presence of each element in `qs` within `p`.**
