You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 100. p is a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100. qs is a list of q positive integers where 1 <= qs[i] <= 100 for all 0 <= i < q.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: After executing the loop for t iterations, the output state will consist of t lists, each containing q elements. Each element in these lists is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, where `p` is a list of k sorted integers provided in each iteration. The output is formatted as a series of lines, with each line containing q space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1` for that particular iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists k, q, p, and qs, where k and q are positive integers within the range [1, 100], p is a list of k positive integers in ascending order within the range [1, 100], and qs is a list of q positive integers within the range [1, 100]. The function returns a list of q boolean values indicating whether each element in qs is present in p.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
