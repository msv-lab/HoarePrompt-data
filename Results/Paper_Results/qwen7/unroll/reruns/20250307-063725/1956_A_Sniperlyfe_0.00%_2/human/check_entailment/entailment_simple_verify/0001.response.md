### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of removing players from the game until no more players can be removed.
   - The logic inside the while loop is correct in that it decreases `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. However, the final state of `n` being 0 is correct, as it indicates that all players have been removed according to the rules of the game.
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` becomes less than the smallest element in `p`, terminating the loop and returning `n`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, the sequence `p`, and the list of query sizes `qs`.
   - It iterates over each query size `n` in `qs` and calls `func_1` to determine the number of winners for that specific `n`.
   - It collects the results in a list `res` and prints the results for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game process where players are removed based on the sequence `p`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than the smallest value in `p` by stopping the loop.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and multiple queries within each test case.

5. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow of the functions.
   - The state descriptions match the actual behavior of the functions.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and validation using the annotated code, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle properly.
