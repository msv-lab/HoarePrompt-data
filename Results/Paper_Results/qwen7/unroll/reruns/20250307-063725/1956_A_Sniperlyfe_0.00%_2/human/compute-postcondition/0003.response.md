Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined lists k, q, p, and qs, where k and q are positive integers within the range [1, 100], p is a list of k positive integers in ascending order within the range [1, 100], and qs is a list of q positive integers within the range [1, 100]. The function returns a list of q boolean values indicating whether each element in qs is present in p.**

This means the function checks each element in the list `qs` to see if it exists in the list `p` and returns a list of boolean values (True or False) corresponding to each element in `qs`.
