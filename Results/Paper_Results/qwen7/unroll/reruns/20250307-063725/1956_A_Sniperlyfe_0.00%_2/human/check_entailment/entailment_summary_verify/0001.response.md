### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (number of players) and `p` (the sequence `a`).
   - It iteratively removes players from the game until no more players can be removed.
   - Specifically, it uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the sum of players to be removed (`sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`) from `n` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the sequence `k`, the number of queries `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of query sizes `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each query size `n` in `qs` and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game process where players are removed based on the sequence `p`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than the smallest value in `p` by stopping the loop.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the function `func_1` that affects its correctness. Specifically, the function does not handle the scenario where the sequence `p` contains repeated values. For example, if `p = [3, 3]` and `n = 5`, the function will incorrectly remove players based on the count of `3` instead of just once.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary for `func_2` states that it checks if each element in `qs` is present in `p`. This is misleading because `func_2` actually calls `func_1` for each query size `n` in `qs`, which simulates the game process rather than checking for presence.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game process when the sequence `p` contains repeated values. This can lead to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
