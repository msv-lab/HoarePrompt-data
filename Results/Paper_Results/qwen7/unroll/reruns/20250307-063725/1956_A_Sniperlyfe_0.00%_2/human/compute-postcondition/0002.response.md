Output State: **After executing the loop for t iterations, the output state will consist of t lists, each containing q elements. Each element in these lists is the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs`, where `p` is a list of k sorted integers provided in each iteration. The output is formatted as a series of lines, with each line containing q space-separated integers representing the results of `func_1` for that particular iteration.**
