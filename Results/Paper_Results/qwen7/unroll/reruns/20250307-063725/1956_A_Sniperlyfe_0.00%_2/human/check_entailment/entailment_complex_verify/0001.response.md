### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of removing players from the game based on the sequence `p`.
   - The while loop iterates as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.
   - In each iteration, `n` is decreased by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`.
   - The loop ensures that `n` is reduced until it is less than the smallest element in `p`, at which point `n` will be 0.
   - The function returns `n`, which will be 0, and the list `p` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of query sizes `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each query size `n` in `qs` and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game process where players are removed based on the sequence `p`.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the implementation of `func_1`:
     - The function `func_1` should return the number of players remaining after the removal process, not necessarily 0.
     - The function should return the value of `n` after the loop terminates, which will be the number of players left in the game.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than the smallest value in `p` by stopping the loop.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and multiple queries within each test case.
   - However, the function should return the correct number of players remaining, not 0.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The current implementation of `func_1` returns 0 after the loop, which is incorrect. The function should return the number of players remaining, which is `n` after the loop terminates.
  - The loop should continue until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`, and then return `n`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.
  - However, the results are based on the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, which returns 0 instead of the correct number of remaining players.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix the issue, we need to modify `func_1` to return the correct number of players remaining:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
    return n
```

This should be changed to:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
    return n
```

However, since the current implementation already correctly reduces `n` until it is less than the smallest element in `p`, the function should simply return `n` after the loop:

```python
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
    return n
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment incorrectly states that the function returns 0, which is not the intended behavior. The function should return the number of players remaining, which is `n` after the loop terminates. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
