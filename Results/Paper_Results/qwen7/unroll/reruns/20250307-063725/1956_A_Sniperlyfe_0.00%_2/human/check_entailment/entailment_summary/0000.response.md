Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of winners in a game based on a sequence of positions `a` and an initial number of players `n`.
- The given code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is designed to simulate the game process for a single initial number of players `n` and a sequence `p` (which is equivalent to `a` in the problem statement). It correctly simulates the game rounds by decrementing `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`. This effectively counts the number of players who remain in the game.
- `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases. It reads the necessary inputs for each test case and calls `func_1` for each initial number of players `n` in the test case. It prints the results for each test case.
- Given the problem description and the execution summaries, both functions appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. `func_1` correctly simulates the game for a single test case, and `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases using `func_1`.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
