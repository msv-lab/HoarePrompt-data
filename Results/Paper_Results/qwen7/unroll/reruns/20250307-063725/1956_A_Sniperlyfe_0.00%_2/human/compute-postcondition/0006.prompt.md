You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and p is a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100.
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
        
    #State: Output State: n is 0 and p remains a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the list `p`. In each iteration, `n` is decreased by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`. Since `p` is a strictly increasing list of positive integers, eventually `n` will become less than the smallest element in `p`, at which point the condition `n >= min(p)` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate. At this point, `n` will be 0, and `p` will remain unchanged because it is not modified within the loop.
    return n
    #n is 0 and p remains a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `p`, which is a list of k positive integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The function returns the same list `p` without any changes.

```

Return Postconditions: n is 0 and p remains a list of k positive integers where 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[k-1] <= 100.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
