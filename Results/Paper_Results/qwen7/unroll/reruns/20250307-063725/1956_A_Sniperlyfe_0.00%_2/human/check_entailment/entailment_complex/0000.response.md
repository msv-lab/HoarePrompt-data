Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It iteratively subtracts the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest element in `p`.
   - The function ensures that `n` becomes zero when no more elements in `p` can be subtracted from `n`, which is the expected behavior for determining the number of players who remain in the game after all possible removals.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases, including the number of rounds (`k`), the number of queries (`q`), the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each initial player count `n` in `qs` and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case, ensuring that the output matches the required format.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - Both functions work together to correctly simulate the game and determine the number of winners for each initial player count.
   - The logic in both functions aligns with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
