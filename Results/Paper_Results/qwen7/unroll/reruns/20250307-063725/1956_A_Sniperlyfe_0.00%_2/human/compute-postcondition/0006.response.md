Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `p`, a list of k positive integers in strictly increasing order between 1 and 100 (inclusive). It decreases the value of `n` by the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `n`, until `n` becomes less than the smallest element in `p`. After the loop terminates, the function returns `n`, which will be 0, and the list `p` remains unchanged.**
