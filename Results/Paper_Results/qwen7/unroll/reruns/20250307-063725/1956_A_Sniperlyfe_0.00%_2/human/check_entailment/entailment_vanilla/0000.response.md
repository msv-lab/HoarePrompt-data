### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (number of players) and `p` (the sequence `a`).
   - It iteratively removes players from the game until no more players can be removed.
   - Specifically, it uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the sum of players to be removed (`sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`) from `n` as long as `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in `p`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the sequence `k`, the number of queries `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of query sizes `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each query size `n` in `qs` and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly simulates the game process where players are removed based on the sequence `p`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than the smallest value in `p` by stopping the loop.
   - The function correctly handles multiple test cases and multiple queries within each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
