Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (number of players) and `p` (the sequence `a`).
   - It iteratively removes players according to the sequence `p` until no more players can be removed.
   - The inner loop `(1 for x in p if x <= n)` counts how many players need to be removed in the current round.
   - The outer loop continues until `n` (the remaining number of players) is less than the smallest value in `p`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each initial player count `n` in `qs` and appends the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

The logic in both functions is consistent with the problem statement and handles all given examples correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
