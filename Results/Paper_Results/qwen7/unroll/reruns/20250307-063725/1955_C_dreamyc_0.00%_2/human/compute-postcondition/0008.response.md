Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns 1 if no elements are removed from nums during the loop's execution, and returns the count of elements removed from nums otherwise.**
