Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly simulates the process of the Kraken attacking the ships according to the specified pattern.
2. The `func_1` function uses a deque to efficiently manage the removal of ships from both ends.
3. The logic inside the function correctly handles the reduction of ship durability and counting the number of sunk ships.
4. The program iterates through each test case as expected, processing the input and output for each one.
5. The conditions for stopping the loop and handling the final ship (if any) are correctly implemented.

Given the above points, the program appears to accurately simulate the described scenario and correctly count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
