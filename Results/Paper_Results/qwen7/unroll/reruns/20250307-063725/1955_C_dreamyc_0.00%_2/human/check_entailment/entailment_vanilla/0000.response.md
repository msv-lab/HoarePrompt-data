Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of the ships `nums`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
4. In `func_1`, the program uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends.
5. It repeatedly attacks the first and last ships until either all ships sink or there are fewer than 2 ships left.
6. The logic for handling the attacks is correct:
   - It takes the minimum durability of the first and last ships.
   - It subtracts this value from both ships and decreases the attack count `k` accordingly.
   - If a ship's durability drops to 0, it increments the answer `ans` and removes the ship from further consideration.
7. After the loop, if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked (`k >= nums[0]`), it adds 1 to `ans`.
8. The logic handles all the given examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **True**
