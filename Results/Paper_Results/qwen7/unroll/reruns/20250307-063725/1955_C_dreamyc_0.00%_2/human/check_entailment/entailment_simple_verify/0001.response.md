### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of the ships `nums`.
   - It initializes a deque `nums` and calls the function `func_1` with these parameters.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a deque `nums` and sets `ans` to 0.
   - It enters a loop that continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and there are at least 2 ships left in the deque.
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements of the deque and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively.
   - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and subtracts this value from both `a` and `b` if `k` is sufficient.
   - If the durability of `a` or `b` drops to 0, it increments `ans` and removes the ship from the deque.
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked (`k >= nums[0]`), it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns `ans`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where there is only one ship left and it can still be attacked.
   - The use of a deque allows efficient popping from both ends, ensuring that the Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately.

4. **Correctness of Logic:**
   - The logic for handling the attacks is correct. It ensures that the Kraken attacks the first and last ships alternately and stops when either all ships sink or there are fewer than 2 ships left.
   - The function correctly updates the durability of the ships and increments `ans` when a ship sinks.
   - The final check ensures that if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked, the function correctly increments `ans`.

5. **Examples:**
   - The annotated code and the provided examples confirm that the function handles all the given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken.

### Final:
**True**

The given program is correct.
