You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns ans + 1, where ans is the count of elements removed from nums during the loop's execution, and since nums contains at most one element, ans is 0, thus the program returns 1.
    #State: The deque `nums` will contain at most one element, `ans` will be the count of elements removed from `nums` during the loop's execution. The condition `(k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]))` is false.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is the count of elements removed from nums during the loop's execution. Since the condition (k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0])) is false, no elements are removed, so ans remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the elements in nums by repeatedly removing pairs of elements until either k becomes insufficient or nums has fewer than two elements left. During each iteration, it reduces the values of the pair by their minimum value and updates k accordingly. If k is still sufficient after processing all possible pairs, it removes the remaining element (if any) and increments the count of removed elements. Finally, it returns the total count of elements removed from nums.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of the ships `nums`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` with these parameters and prints the result.
4. In `func_1`, the program uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends.
5. It repeatedly attacks the first and last ships until either all ships sink or there are fewer than 2 ships left.
6. The logic for handling the attacks is correct:
   - It takes the minimum durability of the first and last ships.
   - It subtracts this value from both ships and decreases the attack count `k` accordingly.
   - If a ship's durability drops to 0, it increments the answer `ans` and removes the ship from further consideration.
7. After the loop, if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked (`k >= nums[0]`), it adds 1 to `ans`.
8. The logic handles all the given examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken.
