### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of the ships `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes a deque from the list `nums`.
   - It uses a while loop to process the attacks until either `k` becomes insufficient or there are fewer than 2 ships left in the deque.
   - Inside the loop:
     - It pops the first and last elements from the deque and assigns them to `a` and `b`.
     - It calculates the minimum durability between `a` and `b` and reduces both `a` and `b` by this minimum value.
     - It updates `k` by subtracting twice the minimum durability.
     - If `a` or `b` is greater than 0, it appends them back to the deque. Otherwise, it increments the answer `ans` by 1.
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked (`k >= nums[0]`), it increments `ans` by 1.
   - Finally, it returns `ans`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where the last ship is the only remaining ship and can still be attacked.
   - The use of a deque ensures efficient popping from both ends, which is crucial for the alternating pattern of attacks.

4. **Correctness Verification Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations provided in the code align with the expected behavior of the function.
   - The state transitions described in the annotations match the logic implemented in the function.
   - The final value of `ans` is correctly calculated based on the number of ships that sink during the attacks.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken. The function handles all the given examples correctly and follows the specified problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
