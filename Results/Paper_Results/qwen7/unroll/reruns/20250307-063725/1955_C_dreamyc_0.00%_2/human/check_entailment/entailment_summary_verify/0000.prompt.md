You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):
        return ans + 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the elements in nums by repeatedly removing pairs of elements until either k becomes insufficient or nums has fewer than two elements left. During each iteration, it reduces the values of the pair by their minimum value and updates k accordingly. If k is still sufficient after processing all possible pairs, it removes the remaining element (if any) and increments the count of removed elements. Finally, it returns the total count of elements removed from nums.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the number of attacks `k` is less than the total number of durability points of the first and last ships combined. Specifically, consider the following input:

```
1
4 2
1 2 4 3
```

In this case, the Kraken will attack the first ship twice, reducing its durability from 1 to 0, and then attack the last ship once, reducing its durability from 3 to 2. Since the first ship has already sunk, the Kraken will stop attacking the last ship. However, the program incorrectly counts the last ship as sunk because it does not properly handle the remaining attacks after a ship has sunk.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it stops counting a ship as sunk once its durability reaches 0 and no further attacks are possible on that ship.
