Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining attacks when there is one ship left in the deque is incorrect. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**: The current implementation checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `nums[0]` but doesn't properly account for the remaining attacks on the single ship. It should continue decrementing the ship's durability until it sinks.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function should ensure that if the remaining attacks (`k`) can still sink the last ship, it should do so correctly. The current logic might prematurely terminate without fully accounting for the remaining attacks.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ans = func_1(n, k, nums)
    print(ans)

def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    # Handle the case where there is one ship left
    if k > 0 and len(nums) == 1:
        if k >= nums[0]:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

In this corrected version, the function ensures that if there is one ship left and there are enough remaining attacks to sink it, it will correctly increment the count of sunk ships.
