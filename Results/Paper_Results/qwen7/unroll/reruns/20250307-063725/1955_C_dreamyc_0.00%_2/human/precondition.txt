t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15; nums is a list of positive integers such that 1 ≤ len(nums) ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < len(nums), and the sum of all n across test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
