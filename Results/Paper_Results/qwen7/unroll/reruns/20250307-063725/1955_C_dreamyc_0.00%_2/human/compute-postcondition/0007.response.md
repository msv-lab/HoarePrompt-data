Output State: **The program returns ans which is the count of elements removed from nums during the loop's execution. Since the condition (k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0])) is false, no elements are removed, so ans remains 0.**

This means that no elements were removed from the deque `nums` because the given condition was not met, and thus `ans` remains 0.
