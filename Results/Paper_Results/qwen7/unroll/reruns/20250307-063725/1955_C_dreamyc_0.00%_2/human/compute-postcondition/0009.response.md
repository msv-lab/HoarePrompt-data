Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15), and nums (a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It processes the elements in nums by repeatedly removing pairs of elements until either k becomes insufficient or nums has fewer than two elements left. During each iteration, it reduces the values of the pair by their minimum value and updates k accordingly. If k is still sufficient after processing all possible pairs, it removes the remaining element (if any) and increments the count of removed elements. Finally, it returns the total count of elements removed from nums.**
