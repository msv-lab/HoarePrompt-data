### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Reading Input and Iterating Over Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of the ships `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` uses a deque to efficiently handle the removal of elements from both ends.
   - The function repeatedly attacks the first and last ships until either all ships sink or there are fewer than 2 ships left.
   - The logic for handling the attacks is as follows:
     - It takes the minimum durability of the first and last ships.
     - It subtracts this value from both ships and decreases the attack count `k` accordingly.
     - If a ship's durability drops to 0, it increments the answer `ans` and removes the ship from further consideration.
   - After the loop, if there is one ship left and it can still be attacked (`k >= nums[0]`), it adds 1 to `ans`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where there is only one ship left and it can still be attacked.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the number of attacks `k` is insufficient to sink all ships.

4. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total count of elements removed from `nums`, which corresponds to the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

### Verification Using the Function Summary:

- The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_1`:
  - It processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly removing pairs of elements until either `k` becomes insufficient or `nums` has fewer than two elements left.
  - During each iteration, it reduces the values of the pair by their minimum value and updates `k` accordingly.
  - If `k` is still sufficient after processing all possible pairs, it removes the remaining element (if any) and increments the count of removed elements.
  - Finally, it returns the total count of elements removed from `nums`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine how many ships are sunk by the Kraken. The function `func_1` accurately simulates the described behavior, and the overall structure of the program handles all test cases correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
