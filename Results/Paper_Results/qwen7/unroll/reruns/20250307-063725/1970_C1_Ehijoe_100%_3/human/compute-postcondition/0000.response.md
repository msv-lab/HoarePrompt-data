Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the next line contains t integers u_1, ..., u_t such that 1 ≤ u_i ≤ n, `n` is updated to the first integer input and `t` is updated to the second integer input.**

In this state, the values of `n` and `t` have been updated to the integers provided as input, while the constraints on `u` and `v` remain unchanged. The next line containing `t` integers (which in this case is 1 integer) is yet to be read.
