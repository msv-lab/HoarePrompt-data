Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `empty` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `edges` remain unchanged from their initial states.
