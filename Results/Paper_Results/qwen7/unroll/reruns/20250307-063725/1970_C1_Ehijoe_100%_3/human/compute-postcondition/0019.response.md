Output State: **`tree` now contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with the additional node `e` appended, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` node within the `tree` list. This index is stored in the variable `idx`. All other variables remain in their initial states.
