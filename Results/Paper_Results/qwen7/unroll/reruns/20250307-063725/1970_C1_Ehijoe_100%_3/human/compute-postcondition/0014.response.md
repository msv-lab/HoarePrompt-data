Output State: **`empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that they were input within the range 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n during the loop, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each node `i` in the range 1 to `n`, `nodes[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`; `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one connection (degree of 1); `s` is an element from `ends`, `e` is an element from `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the element `s`; `prev` is the element `s`; `curr` is the first node directly connected to `s`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first node directly connected to `s` to `curr`. Since `s` is an element from `ends`, it means `s` has exactly one connection. The variable `curr` now holds the value of the node directly connected to `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
