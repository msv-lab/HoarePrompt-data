Output State: `empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that they were input within the range 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n during the loop, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each node `i` in the range 1 to `n`, `nodes[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`; `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one connection (i.e., nodes with a degree of 1).
