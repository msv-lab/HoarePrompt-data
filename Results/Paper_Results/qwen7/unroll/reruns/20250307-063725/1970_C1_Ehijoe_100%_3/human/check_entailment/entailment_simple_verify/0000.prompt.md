You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic for determining the winner based on the optimal play of Ron and Hermione. Specifically, the program does not consider the parity of the number of moves available from each starting node to determine the winner. 

The program calculates the distance from the starting node to the leaf node and checks if this distance is odd or even to decide the winner. However, this approach is flawed because it does not account for the entire structure of the tree and the optimal moves available from each node.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5
```

In this case, the tree is structured such that the starting node (5) is connected to node 4, and node 4 is connected to node 3, which is connected to node 2, and finally node 2 is connected to node 1. The program will calculate the distance from node 5 to node 1 as 4, which is even, and incorrectly conclude that Hermione wins. However, if Hermione plays optimally, she can force Ron into a losing position.

A correct solution would need to consider the entire structure of the tree and the optimal moves available from each node, not just the distance to the leaf node. Therefore, the provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
