Output State: **The variable `tree` now contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with the additional node `e` appended, and all other variables (`empty`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, `nodes`, `ends`, `prev`, and `curr`) remain in their initial states or unchanged.**

This means that the list `tree` has been updated by appending the node `e` to its current contents, while all other variables such as `empty`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, `nodes`, `ends`, `prev`, and `curr` retain their original values or states.
