You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t` (which is fixed at 1).
   - It constructs the tree using adjacency lists stored in `nodes`.

2. **Identifying Leaf Nodes**:
   - The program correctly identifies the two leaf nodes (`s` and `e`) by checking the degree of each node.

3. **Traversing the Tree**:
   - The program correctly traverses from one leaf node to the other, constructing the path `tree` between them.
   - This ensures that the path represents a valid traversal of the tree from one leaf to the other.

4. **Determining Initial Node Position**:
   - The program correctly finds the index of the initial node `start` within the `tree`.

5. **Calculating Moves**:
   - The program calculates the distance from the start node to the end of the path (`n - idx - 1`) and the distance to the start of the path (`idx`).
   - These distances represent the number of moves required to reach the end or start of the path from the initial node.

6. **Winning Condition**:
   - The program checks if any of these distances is odd. If so, Ron wins because he makes the first move and can force the game into an odd-numbered move state.
   - Otherwise, Hermione wins because she can always respond to Ron's moves, maintaining the even-numbered move state.

7. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Ron" if any of the calculated moves is odd, and "Hermione" otherwise.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to be correct and should handle all valid inputs as specified.

### Correctness:
