Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or the relationship between them. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while noting the new state of the `edges` list.
