Output State: **`tree` now contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with the additional node `e` appended, `start` is an input integer, and all other variables (`empty`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, `nodes`, `ends`, `prev`, and `curr`) remain in their initial states.**

Explanation: The variable `start` is assigned the value of the integer input by the user. All other variables (`empty`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `edges`, `nodes`, `ends`, `prev`, and `curr`) remain unchanged from their initial states. The `tree` variable is updated to include the path from node `s` to node `e` with the additional node `e` appended, which is already part of its initial state.
