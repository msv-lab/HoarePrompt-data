Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that they were input within the range 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n during the loop, `edges` is an empty list, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each node `i` in the range 1 to `n`, `nodes[i]` contains a list of all nodes directly connected to node `i`; `ends` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one connection (degree of 1); `s` is an element from `ends`, `e` is an element from `ends`; `tree` is a list containing the element `s`; `prev` is the element `s`; `curr` is the first node directly connected to `s`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
