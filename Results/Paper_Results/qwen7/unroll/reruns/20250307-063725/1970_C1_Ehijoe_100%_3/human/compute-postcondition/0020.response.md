Output State: **`tree` now contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with the additional node `e` appended, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `moves` which contains two elements: `idx` (which is the index of `start` in `tree`) and `n - idx - 1` (which represents the number of nodes between `idx` and the end of the list `tree`). The initial state of `tree`, `start`, and `idx` remains unchanged.
