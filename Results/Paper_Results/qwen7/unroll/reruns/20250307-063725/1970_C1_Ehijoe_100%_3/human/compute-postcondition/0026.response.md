Postcondition: `tree` now contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with the additional node `e` appended, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If there exists at least one odd number in the `moves` list, the postcondition remains as initially described. If all moves in the `moves` list are even numbers, the postcondition also remains as initially described.
