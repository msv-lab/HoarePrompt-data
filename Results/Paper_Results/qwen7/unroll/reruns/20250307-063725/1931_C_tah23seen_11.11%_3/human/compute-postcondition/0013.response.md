Output State: **The program returns the difference between the length of the array `arr` and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**

This means if the length of the array `arr` is `j` and the index `i` is the point where the condition `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]` is first met, the program returns `j - i`.
