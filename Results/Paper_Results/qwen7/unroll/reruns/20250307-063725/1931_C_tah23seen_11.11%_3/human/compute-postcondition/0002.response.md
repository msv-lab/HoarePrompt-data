Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while i <= j:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `j`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is the length of `arr` - 1

4. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.
   - Given that `i` is currently 0, `j` must be at least 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, and the length of `arr` must be at least 1 for `j` to be non-negative, we need to ensure that `j` is non-negative.
   - Therefore, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `j` is non-negative.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `j` must be greater than or equal to 0**
