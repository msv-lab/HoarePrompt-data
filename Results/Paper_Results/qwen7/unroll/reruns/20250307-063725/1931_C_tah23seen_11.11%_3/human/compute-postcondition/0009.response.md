Output State: i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1].

Explanation: The loop continues as long as the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`. Each iteration of the loop increments `i` by 1. This process continues until it finds an index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or if there are no more elements to compare (i.e., `i + 1` exceeds the array length). At this point, the loop terminates, and `i` will point to the last index where consecutive elements were found to be equal.
