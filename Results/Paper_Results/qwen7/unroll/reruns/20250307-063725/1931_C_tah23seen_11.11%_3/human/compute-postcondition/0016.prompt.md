You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i is greater than j.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: i is greater than j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`. Each iteration of the loop increments `i` by 1. This process continues until it finds an index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or if there are no more elements to compare (i.e., `i + 1` exceeds the array length). At this point, the loop terminates, and `i` will point to the last index where consecutive elements were found to be equal.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between j and i plus 1, where j is not equal to the length of arr minus 1 and i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1]
    #State: `i` points to an index where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` equals the length of the array `arr`.
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the length of the array `arr` and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.
#
#The function returns:
#- **Case_1:** 0
#- **Case_2:** The difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1 and `i` points to an index where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`
#- **Case_3:** The difference between the length of the array `arr` and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return either 0, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 under certain conditions, or the difference between the length of the array and the index `i` where the condition is met.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between j and i plus 1, where j is not equal to the length of arr minus 1 and i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1]

Case_3: The program returns the difference between the length of the array `arr` and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
