Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The operation allows setting a subarray from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`, costing `(j - i + 1)` burles.

2. **Initial Checks**:
   - The function first checks if the entire array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it returns 0 because no operation is needed.
   - If the array is not uniform, it looks for the longest segment where all elements are the same.

3. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It iterates through the array to find the first mismatch (`arr[i] != arr[j]`).
   - If the entire array is uniform, it returns 0.
   - If the array is not uniform, it then checks for consecutive identical elements starting from `i` and moving forward until it finds a different element.
   - Finally, it calculates the cost based on the longest segment of identical elements found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire array is uniform, the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has a segment of identical elements followed by different elements, the function correctly calculates the cost of setting the entire array to the value of the segment.

5. **Return Values**:
   - If the array is uniform, it returns 0.
   - If there is a segment of identical elements, it returns the length of that segment.
   - If no such segment exists, it returns the length of the remaining part of the array.

Given the logic and edge cases, the function appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
