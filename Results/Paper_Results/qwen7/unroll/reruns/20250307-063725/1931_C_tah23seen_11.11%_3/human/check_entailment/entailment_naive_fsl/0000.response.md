Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not consider all possible operations that could minimize the cost.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
The program will output `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here's why:

- We can change the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to `1` in one operation, which costs `4` burles.
- Alternatively, we can change the subarray `[1, 2, 3, 4]` to `1` in one operation, which also costs `4` burles.
- Another optimal solution is to change the subarray `[2, 3, 4]` to `1` and then change the subarray `[5, 1]` to `1`, which costs `3 + 1 = 4` burles.

However, the program only checks for the first occurrence of different elements and calculates the cost based on that, which does not guarantee the minimum cost. It fails to explore other possible operations that might result in a lower cost.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
