Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns either 0, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 under certain conditions, or the difference between the length of the array and the index `i` where the condition is met. Specifically, it checks for consecutive equal elements in the list and calculates the length of the longest sequence of such elements. If no such sequence exists, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the length of the longest sequence or the remaining part of the list after the sequence.**
