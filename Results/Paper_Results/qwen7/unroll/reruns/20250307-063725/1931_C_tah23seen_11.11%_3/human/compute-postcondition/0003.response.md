Output State: **i is greater than j.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Inside the loop, if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are equal, both `i` and `j` are adjusted (incrementing `i` and decrementing `j`). If they are not equal, the loop breaks. After the loop completes, it means that either all corresponding elements from the start and end of the array matched and were skipped, or there was at least one pair of non-matching elements which caused the loop to break. In either case, `i` will be greater than `j`, indicating that the entire array has been checked for matching pairs from both ends towards the center.
