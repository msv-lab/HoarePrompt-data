Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing different segments of the array and setting them to the same value. Instead, it only checks if the elements at the start and end of the array are the same and then tries to find the longest sequence of consecutive identical elements starting from the beginning. This approach does not guarantee the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to use a different strategy, such as dynamic programming or a more sophisticated approach to find the optimal segment operations.
