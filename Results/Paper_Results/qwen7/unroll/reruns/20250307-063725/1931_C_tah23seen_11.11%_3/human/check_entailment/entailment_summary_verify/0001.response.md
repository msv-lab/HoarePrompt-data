### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The function first checks if the entire array is already uniform. If so, it returns 0.
   - It then checks for consecutive elements that are the same and skips them.
   - Finally, it calculates the cost of making all elements from index `i` to `j` equal to the element at index `i`.
   - The key issue here is that the function only considers the first non-uniform segment and does not account for the possibility of making the entire array uniform with a single operation.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost is calculated as `(j - i + 1)` where `i` and `j` are the bounds of the subarray that needs to be made uniform.
   - However, the function does not correctly identify the optimal segment to make uniform. It only considers the first non-uniform segment and does not check if making the entire array uniform would be cheaper.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios including arrays that are already uniform, arrays with multiple segments that need to be made uniform, and arrays that require a single operation to become uniform.
   - The function does not handle the general case where the entire array might be made uniform with a single operation, which is required by the problem statement.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 4 (for `[2, 3, 4, 5]`), but the optimal solution is to make the entire array uniform with a single operation costing 5 (for `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It only considers the first non-uniform segment and does not account for the possibility of making the entire array uniform with a single operation.
