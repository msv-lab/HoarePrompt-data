Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then checks if the elements at these pointers are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward. If not, it breaks out of the loop.
   - After the loop, if `i` is greater than `j`, it means all elements are already equal, so it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it enters another loop to find the last position where consecutive elements are equal (`i`). This is done by incrementing `i` while `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - Finally, it checks if `j` is not the last index of the array. If true, it returns the cost of making all elements from `i` to `j` equal, which is `j - i + 1`.
   - If `j` is the last index, it returns `j - i`, which is the cost of making all remaining elements equal to `arr[i]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all elements are already equal by returning 0.
   - It also correctly identifies the last position where consecutive elements are equal and calculates the cost of making the rest of the array uniform.

4. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the correct minimum cost for each test case.

Given the analysis, the logic in the function `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
