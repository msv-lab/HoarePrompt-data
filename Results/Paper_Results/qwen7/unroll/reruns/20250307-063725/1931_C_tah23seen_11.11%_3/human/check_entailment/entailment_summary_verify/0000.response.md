### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function `func_1` based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The operation involves selecting a subarray from index `i` to `j` and setting all elements within this range to a value `x`.
   - The cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the longest subarray where all elements are the same and return the length of this subarray.
   - However, as noted in the original assessment, the function only checks for the first occurrence of different elements and calculates the cost based on that. This approach does not necessarily yield the minimum cost because it doesn't explore all possible operations.

3. **Example Revisited**:
   - Consider the input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.
   - The function `func_1` would identify the subarray `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and return the length `4` as the cost.
   - However, the optimal solution is to change the subarray `[2, 3, 4]` to `1` and then change the subarray `[5, 1]` to `1`, resulting in a total cost of `3 + 1 = 4` burles.

4. **Exploring Other Operations**:
   - The function `func_1` does not account for breaking the array into multiple segments and applying operations to each segment separately to achieve the minimum cost.
   - For instance, in the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, changing `[2, 3, 4]` to `1` and then `[5, 1]` to `1` is a valid and potentially cheaper operation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle all possible scenarios and does not guarantee the minimum cost.
   - The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not consider all possible operations that could minimize the cost.
