Output State: i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1].

Explanation: The loop continues as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. This process continues until `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, at which point the loop terminates. Therefore, when the loop finishes executing, `i` will be pointing to an index where the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is false.
