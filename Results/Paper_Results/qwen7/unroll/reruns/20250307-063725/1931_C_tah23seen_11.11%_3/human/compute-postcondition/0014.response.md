The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.

The function returns:
- Case_1: 0
- Case_2: The difference between `j` and `i` plus 1, where `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` minus 1 and `i` points to an index where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
- Case_3: The difference between the length of the array `arr` and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return either 0, the difference between `j` and `i` plus 1 under certain conditions, or the difference between the length of the array and the index `i` where the sequence breaks.
