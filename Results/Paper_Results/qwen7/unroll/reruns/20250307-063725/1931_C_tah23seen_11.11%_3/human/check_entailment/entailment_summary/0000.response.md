Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest subarray where all elements are the same. The idea is to find the longest segment of the array where all elements are identical and then calculate the cost of making the entire array equal by changing the rest of the array to match this segment. However, there are several issues with the logic in the `func_1` function:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the Longest Segment**: The function does not correctly identify the longest segment of identical elements. Instead, it tries to find a segment where the first and last elements are the same but does not ensure that all elements within this segment are identical.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The cost calculation is based on the length of the segment found, which is not necessarily the optimal solution. The correct approach should involve finding the most frequent element and calculating the cost to change all other elements to this most frequent element.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire array is already uniform or when the most frequent element spans the entire array.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
