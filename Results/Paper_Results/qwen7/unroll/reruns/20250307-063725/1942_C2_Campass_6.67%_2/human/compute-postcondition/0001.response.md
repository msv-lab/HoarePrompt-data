Output State: **`t` is a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` calls the lambda function `R()`, which returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers. The variable `t` is assigned this tuple. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) no longer applies since `t` now holds a tuple. The precondition that `R()` returns a tuple of integers is maintained.
