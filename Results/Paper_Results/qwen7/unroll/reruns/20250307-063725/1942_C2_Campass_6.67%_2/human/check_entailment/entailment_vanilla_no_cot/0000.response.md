Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles:**
   - The logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed. Specifically, the calculation `sx += y * 2` and `sx += i` is incorrect. The number of triangles formed should be calculated based on the number of segments and the constraints given by `x` and `y`.

2. **Sorting and Processing of Vertices:**
   - The sorting and processing of vertices are not aligned with the requirements of forming triangles. The current approach does not correctly handle the formation of non-intersecting diagonals and the resulting triangles.

3. **Break Logic:**
   - The `break` statement inside the loop is used incorrectly. It prematurely exits the loop without properly accounting for the remaining vertices and their contributions to forming triangles.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation `cons = x + sx - 2` and `cons = min(n - 2, cons)` does not correctly reflect the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces that can be formed.

To solve this problem correctly, a more detailed and accurate approach is needed, involving dynamic programming or a combinatorial method to count the maximum number of triangles that can be formed under the given constraints.
