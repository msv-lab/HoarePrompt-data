Output State: The output state will be a series of integers representing the value of `cons` printed after each iteration of the loop. Each `cons` value is calculated based on the operations within the loop, including sorting, appending, and iterating through the list `l`, as well as updating `sx` and `y`.

The exact values of these outputs depend on the specific inputs provided by the functions `R()` at each iteration. Since the problem does not specify the initial values of `t` or the details of the function `R()`, we can't provide a concrete numerical output. However, the process described above will determine the `cons` value for each iteration until `t` becomes zero, at which point the loop terminates and no further output is produced.
