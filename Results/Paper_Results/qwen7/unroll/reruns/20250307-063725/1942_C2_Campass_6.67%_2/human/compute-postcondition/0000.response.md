Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; R is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input and splits it into multiple integers, converting them to integers. This function does not assign any values to `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices. It only defines how these values might be read in the future. Therefore, the precondition regarding `t` remains unchanged, and `R` is now defined as described.
