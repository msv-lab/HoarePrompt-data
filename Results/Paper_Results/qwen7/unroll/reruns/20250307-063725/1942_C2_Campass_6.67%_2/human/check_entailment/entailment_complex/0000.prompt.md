This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, x, y = R()
        
        sx = 0
        
        l = list(R())
        
        l.sort()
        
        l.append(n + l[0])
        
        val = []
        
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            if c == 1:
                sx += 1
            val.append(c)
        
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        
        cons = x + sx - 2
        
        cons = min(n - 2, cons)
        
        print(cons)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be the value of `cons` printed after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down what happens in each iteration of the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: `t` is a tuple of integers. The loop continues as long as `t` is non-empty.
    #2. **Decrement and Input**: `t` is decremented by 1, and then three values `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from some function `R()`.
    #3. **List Manipulation**: A list `l` is created from another function `R()` and sorted. The list is then modified by appending `n + l[0]`.
    #4. **Value Calculation**: A list `val` is created where each element represents the difference between consecutive elements in `l` minus one. This list is then sorted based on specific criteria.
    #5. **Summation**: For each element in `val`, a value `c` is calculated. Depending on the value of `y`, `sx` (a cumulative sum) is updated.
    #6. **Cons Calculation**: `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and is capped at `n - 2`.
    #
    #The final value of `cons` after all iterations of the loop is printed. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the lists generated from `R()` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical output state. However, the output state will always be the value of `cons` computed after all iterations of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `cons` based on the given conditions for each test case and prints the final value of `cons` for each test case. The value of `cons` is determined through a series of operations including sorting, calculating differences, and updating a cumulative sum.
