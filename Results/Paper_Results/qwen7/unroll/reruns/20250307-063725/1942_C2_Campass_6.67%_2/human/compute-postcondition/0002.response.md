The only variable in the loop head is the variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue as long as `t` is not an empty tuple.

Right before the loop, `t` is a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must not be an empty tuple.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is not an empty tuple.

State: **`t` is a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers, and `t` must not be an empty tuple**
