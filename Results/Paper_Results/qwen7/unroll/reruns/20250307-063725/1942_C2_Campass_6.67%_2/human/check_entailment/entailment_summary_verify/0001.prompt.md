You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            if c == 1:
                sx += 1
            val.append(c)
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        cons = min(n - 2, cons)
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `cons` based on the given conditions for each test case and prints the final value of `cons` for each test case. The value of `cons` is determined through a series of operations including sorting, calculating differences, and updating a cumulative sum.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` and a list of `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting and Processing Chosen Vertices:**
   - The chosen vertices are sorted.
   - A new list `l` is created by appending the first vertex to the end of the sorted list. This helps in calculating the gaps between consecutive vertices.

3. **Calculating Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and stores them in the list `val`.
   - It also counts the number of gaps equal to 1 (`sx`), which indicates adjacent vertices.

4. **Optimizing Triangles:**
   - The program sorts the gaps in `val` to prioritize smaller gaps.
   - It iterates through the sorted gaps and tries to maximize the number of triangles using the available `y` vertices.
   - For each gap `i` in `val`, it calculates how many triangles can be formed (`c = i // 2`) and updates the total number of triangles `sx` accordingly.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the final number of triangles `cons` by considering the initial number of triangles formed by the chosen vertices plus the additional triangles formed by the added vertices.
   - It ensures that the final count does not exceed `n - 2`.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly reads and processes the input as required.

2. **Gap Calculation:**
   - The calculation of gaps and the count of gaps equal to 1 is correct.

3. **Triangle Formation:**
   - The logic for forming triangles by adding vertices is sound. The program correctly prioritizes smaller gaps to maximize the number of triangles.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final calculation ensures that the number of triangles does not exceed the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented is correct and aligns with the problem requirements. The program correctly calculates the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.
