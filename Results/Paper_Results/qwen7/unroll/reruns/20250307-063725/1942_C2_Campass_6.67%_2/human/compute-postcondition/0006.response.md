Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `cons` based on the given conditions for each test case and prints the final value of `cons` for each test case. The value of `cons` is determined through a series of operations including sorting, calculating differences, and updating a cumulative sum.**
