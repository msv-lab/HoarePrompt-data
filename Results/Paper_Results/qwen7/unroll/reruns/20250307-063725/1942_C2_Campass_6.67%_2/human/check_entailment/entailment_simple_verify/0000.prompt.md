You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be the value of `cons` printed after all iterations of the loop have finished.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down what happens in each iteration of the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: `t` is a tuple of integers. The loop continues as long as `t` is non-empty.
    #2. **Decrement and Input**: `t` is decremented by 1, and then three values `n`, `x`, and `y` are read from some function `R()`.
    #3. **List Manipulation**: A list `l` is created from another function `R()` and sorted. The list is then modified by appending `n + l[0]`.
    #4. **Value Calculation**: A list `val` is created where each element represents the difference between consecutive elements in `l` minus one. This list is then sorted based on specific criteria.
    #5. **Summation**: For each element in `val`, a value `c` is calculated. Depending on the value of `y`, `sx` (a cumulative sum) is updated.
    #6. **Cons Calculation**: `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and is capped at `n - 2`.
    #
    #The final value of `cons` after all iterations of the loop is printed. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the lists generated from `R()` are not specified, we cannot provide a numerical output state. However, the output state will always be the value of `cons` computed after all iterations of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to account for the correct number of triangles that can be formed based on the given constraints.

### Analysis:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and the list of chosen vertices \( l \).
2. **Sorting and Calculation**: The program sorts the list of chosen vertices and calculates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices. It then sorts these gaps to prioritize smaller gaps.
3. **Triangle Formation**: The program attempts to form triangles using the gaps. However, the logic for forming triangles is flawed. It incorrectly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed based on the gaps and the remaining choices \( y \).

### Issue:
The program does not correctly handle the formation of triangles. For example, consider the following test case:

- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  8 4 2
  1 6 2 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: `6` (as shown in the example)

- **Actual Output**: The program outputs `4`.

### Explanation of the Problem:
- The program calculates the gaps between the chosen vertices and tries to form triangles using these gaps. However, it does not correctly account for the fact that each gap can contribute to forming multiple triangles.
- The program's logic for forming triangles is overly simplistic and does not fully utilize the available vertices to maximize the number of triangles.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, one needs to:
1. Identify the gaps between the chosen vertices.
2. Use these gaps to form triangles, ensuring that the triangles do not intersect.
3. Maximize the number of triangles by considering all possible combinations of gaps and remaining choices.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution and hence is incorrect.
