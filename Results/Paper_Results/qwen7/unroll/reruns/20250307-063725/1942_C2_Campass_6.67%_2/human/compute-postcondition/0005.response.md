Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function reads input data containing multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers. The function then processes these inputs according to the specified conditions and returns a result for each test case.
