Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) and \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution attempts to construct such an array \(a\) using the input array \(x\). Specifically, it sets \(a_1 = x_1 + 1\) and then iteratively constructs subsequent elements of \(a\) by ensuring the modulo condition is satisfied.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - \(a_1 = x_1 + 1\) ensures that \(x_1 = a_1 \bmod a_0\) is trivially true since \(a_0\) is not defined but we start with \(a_1 = x_1 + 1\).
   - For \(a_{i+1}\), the code tries to set \(a_{i+1} = arr[i] + a_i\). If this value is less than or equal to \(arr[i+1]\), it keeps adding \(a_i\) until \(a_{i+1}\) exceeds \(arr[i+1]\). This ensures \(x_{i+1} = a_{i+1} \bmod a_i\).
   - Finally, it sets \(a_n = a_{n-1} + arr[n-1]\).

4. The logic seems to be correct in terms of constructing the array \(a\) to satisfy the given conditions. The approach ensures that the modulo condition is met for each step.

Given the analysis, the provided function appears to correctly implement the required logic to generate an array \(a\) that satisfies the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
