Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `ans` is a list of n elements, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.**

Explanation: The code updates the last element of the `ans` list by adding the last element of the `arr` list to the second last element of the `ans` list. All other elements of `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged according to the initial state.
