Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `ans` is a list of n elements, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each `i` from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[i-1]` until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`.
