Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is an integer indicating the length of the full list that `arr` represents (2 ≤ n ≤ 500). It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; finally, `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.**
