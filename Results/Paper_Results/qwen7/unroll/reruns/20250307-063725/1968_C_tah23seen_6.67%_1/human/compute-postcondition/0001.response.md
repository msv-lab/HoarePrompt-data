Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `ans` is a list of n zeros, `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets the first element of the `ans` list to be one more than the first element of the `arr` list. All other elements of both lists remain unchanged.
