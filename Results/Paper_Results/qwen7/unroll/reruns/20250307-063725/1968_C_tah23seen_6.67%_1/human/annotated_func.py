#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n. The variable n is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.

    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `ans` is a list of n elements, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length n, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It constructs and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where i ranges from 1 to n-1), it calculates the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`. Finally, `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
