Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to construct an array `ans` of length `n` such that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
   - The initial value `ans[0]` is set to `arr[0] + 1`, ensuring `x_2 = a_2 \bmod a_1` can be satisfied.
   - For each subsequent `i` from 1 to `n-2`, `ans[i+1]` is calculated as the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` until `ans[i+1]` exceeds `arr[i+1]`. This ensures that `x_{i+1} = a_{i+1} \bmod a_i` holds true.
   - Finally, `ans[-1]` is set to `ans[-2] + arr[-1]`.

2. **Verification of Constraints and Conditions**:
   - The constraints are correctly handled within the function. Specifically, `1 \le a_i \le 10^9` is respected since the values are constructed to satisfy the modulo condition without exceeding this limit.
   - The logic ensures that the modulo condition is met for all `2 \le i \le n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where `arr[i]` might be very small, ensuring that `ans[i]` is adjusted appropriately to satisfy the modulo condition.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The function returns a list `ans` of length `n` that satisfies the given conditions.

Given the analysis, the provided function correctly implements the required logic to generate an array `ans` that meets the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
