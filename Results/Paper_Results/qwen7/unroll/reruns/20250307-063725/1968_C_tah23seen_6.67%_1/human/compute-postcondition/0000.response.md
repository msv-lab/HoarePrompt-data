Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; ans is a list of n zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, all set to 0. The length of `ans` is `n`, which means it has `n` elements. Since `arr` was defined as a list of `n-1` integers before the code, it remains unchanged. Therefore, `ans` is a list of `n` zeros, and `arr` is still a list of `n-1` integers.
