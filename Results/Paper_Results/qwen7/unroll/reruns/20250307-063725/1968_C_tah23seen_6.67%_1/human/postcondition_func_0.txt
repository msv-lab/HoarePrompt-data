The function accepts a list `arr` of n-1 integers and an integer `n`. It constructs and returns a list `ans` of length `n` where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element `ans[i]` (where i ranges from 1 to n-1), it calculates the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`. Finally, `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
