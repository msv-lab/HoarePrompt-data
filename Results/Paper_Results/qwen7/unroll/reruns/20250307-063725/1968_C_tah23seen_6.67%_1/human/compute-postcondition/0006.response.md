Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` of length n, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.**

This means that the program returns a list `ans` which is constructed based on the given list `arr`. The first element of `ans` is `arr[0] + 1`. For each subsequent element, it starts by adding `arr[i]` to the cumulative sum of all previous `ans[j]` (from `ans[0]` to `ans[i-1]`), but stops as soon as this sum exceeds `arr[i]`. The last element of `ans` is the sum of the second last element of `ans` and the last element of `arr`.
