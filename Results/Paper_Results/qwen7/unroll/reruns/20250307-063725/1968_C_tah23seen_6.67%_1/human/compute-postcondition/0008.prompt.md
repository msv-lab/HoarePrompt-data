You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n. The variable n is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [0] * n
    ans[0] = arr[0] + 1
    for i in range(n - 2):
        ans[i + 1] = arr[i] + ans[i]
        
        if ans[i + 1] < arr[i + 1]:
            while ans[i + 1] <= arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i + 1] += ans[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is between 1 and 500 inclusive, representing the values of x_2, x_3, ..., x_n; `ans` is a list of n elements, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`.
    ans[-1] = ans[-2] + arr[-1]
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` of length n, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of n-1 integers, and `n`, which is an integer indicating the length of the full list that `arr` represents (2 ≤ n ≤ 500). It returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; finally, `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `ans` of length n, where `ans[0]` is `arr[0] + 1`, and for each i from 1 to n-1, `ans[i]` is the sum of `arr[i]` and all previous `ans[j]` (where j ranges from 0 to i-1) until `ans[i]` exceeds `arr[i]`; `ans[-1]` is the sum of `ans[-2]` and `arr[-1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
