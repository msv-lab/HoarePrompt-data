You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))

def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns 1 if the substring 'pie' is not present in `s`. If 'pie' is present, it removes all occurrences of 'pie' from `s` and returns the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
4. The function `func_1(s)` checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" is an ugly string and should return 2 deletions (either remove "map" or "pie").
5. The function then uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`. However, the logic here is flawed because it only removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and increments the counter `ans` without checking if the removal of one instance affects the presence of another instance of "map" or "pie".

To fix this, we need to ensure that after removing one instance of "map" or "pie", we recheck the string to see if the other substring still exists. This is necessary because removing "map" might create a new instance of "pie" and vice versa.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        if 'map' in s:
            s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
            ans += 1
        elif 'pie' in s:
            s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

This version ensures that both "map" and "pie" are checked and removed in each iteration until neither exists in the string.

Given the corrections, the original program is incorrect due to the flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function.

Correctness: **False**
