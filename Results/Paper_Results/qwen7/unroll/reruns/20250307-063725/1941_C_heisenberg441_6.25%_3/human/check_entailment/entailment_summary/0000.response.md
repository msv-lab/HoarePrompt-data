Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'` and returns 1 if true. This condition is irrelevant to the actual problem since the goal is to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both 'pie' and 'map' substrings.

2. The function uses two separate while loops to remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'. However, this approach is flawed because it only removes one occurrence at a time and does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string `"mappie"`, the function would remove 'pie' and then 'map', resulting in an incorrect count of removals.

3. The function does not handle the case where both 'map' and 'pie' substrings overlap. For instance, in the string `"mappie"`, the function should remove 2 characters ('m' and 'a') to make the string beautiful, but it incorrectly counts 2 removals instead of 1.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
