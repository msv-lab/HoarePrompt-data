Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.

2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - The string `s` no longer contains the substring 'map'.
   - The variable `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the string `s` must contain the substring 'pie'. Since the current state indicates that `s` no longer contains 'map', it doesn't provide any direct information about whether `s` contains 'pie' or not.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - We need to ensure that the string `s` contains the substring 'pie' for the loop to execute the first time. There is no information given about `s` containing 'pie' or not, so we need to adjust the state to reflect that `s` must contain 'pie'.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **The string `s` must contain the substring 'pie' and no longer contains the substring 'map', and the variable `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`**.
