Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly identifies that the function `func_1` should handle the removal of substrings "pie" and "map" to make the string beautiful.
2. The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, the function returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" should be considered ugly and needs at least one character removed to become beautiful.
3. The function then iterates through the string `s` to find and remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie".
4. However, the logic for counting the removals is flawed. The function increments `ans` every time it finds and removes "map" or "pie", but it does not account for overlapping substrings. For example, in the string "mapmap", the function would incorrectly count the removals as 2 instead of 1.
5. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where both "map" and "pie" are present in the string simultaneously, leading to potential undercounting of removals.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the requirement to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
