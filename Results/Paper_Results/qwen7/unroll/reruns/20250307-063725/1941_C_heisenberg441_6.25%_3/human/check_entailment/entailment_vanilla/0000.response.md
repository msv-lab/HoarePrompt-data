Reasoning:

1. The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
3. It then calls the function `func_1(s)` to determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
4. The function `func_1(s)` checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie". If it is, it returns 1, which is incorrect because "mapie" is an ugly string and should return 2 deletions (either remove "map" or "pie").
5. The function then uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s`. However, the logic here is flawed because it only removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and increments the counter `ans` without checking if the removal of one instance affects the presence of another instance of "map" or "pie".

To fix this, we need to ensure that after removing one instance of "map" or "pie", we recheck the string to see if the other substring still exists. This is necessary because removing "map" might create a new instance of "pie" and vice versa.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        if 'map' in s:
            s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
            ans += 1
        elif 'pie' in s:
            s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

This version ensures that both "map" and "pie" are checked and removed in each iteration until neither exists in the string.

Given the corrections, the original program is incorrect due to the flaw in the logic of the `func_1` function.

Correctness: **False**
