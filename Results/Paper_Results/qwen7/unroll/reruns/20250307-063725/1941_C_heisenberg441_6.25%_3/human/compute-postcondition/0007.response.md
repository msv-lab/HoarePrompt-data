Output State: **The string `s` no longer contains the substring 'pie', and the variable `ans` is the number of times 'pie' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`. During each iteration, it removes 'pie' from `s` by slicing the string before and after the found 'pie' and concatenating them, then increments the counter `ans` by 1. This process repeats until 'pie' is no longer present in `s`. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `s` will no longer contain 'pie', and `ans` will hold the total count of how many times 'pie' was removed.
