Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates through each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string (`n`) and the string itself (`s`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'`. If it is, it returns `1`, which is incorrect because `'mapie'` should be considered an ugly string and thus should require at least one removal to become beautiful.
   - If `s` is not `'mapie'`, the function initializes `ans` to `0` and then removes occurrences of `"map"` and `"pie"` from `s` by finding their indices and slicing the string accordingly. It increments `ans` each time it removes a substring.
   - After removing all occurrences of `"map"` and `"pie"`, the function returns `ans`, which represents the total number of characters removed.

3. **Handling `'mapie'`**:
   - The current implementation incorrectly returns `1` for the string `'mapie'`. According to the problem statement, `"mapie"` should be considered an ugly string and should require at least one removal to become beautiful. Therefore, the function should return `1` for `'mapie'`.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic for removing `"map"` and `"pie"` substrings is correct.
   - However, the handling of the special case `'mapie'` is incorrect.

Given this analysis, the program is almost correct but fails to handle the special case `'mapie'` properly.

Correctness: **False**
