Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The function returns 1 if 'pie' is not found in the string s. If 'pie' is found, it removes all occurrences of 'pie' from s and returns the number of times 'pie' was found and removed.**
