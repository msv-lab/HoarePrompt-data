Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in how it handles the removal of substrings. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie". Here's why:

1. **Overlapping Substrings**: The function uses `s.find('map')` and `s.find('pie')` to find the first occurrence of these substrings and then removes them. However, this approach can lead to incorrect results when there are overlapping occurrences. For example, in the string "mapmap", the function would only remove one instance of "map" at a time, leading to an incorrect count of deletions needed.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Overlaps**: The function does not account for the possibility that after removing one instance of "map" or "pie", another instance might overlap with the previous one. This means the function might miss opportunities to remove more instances in a single pass.

To fix this, we need to ensure that we handle overlapping substrings correctly. One way to do this is to use a loop that continues to check and remove the substrings until no more occurrences are found.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        if 'map' in s:
            s = s.replace('map', '', 1)
            ans += 1
        elif 'pie' in s:
            s = s.replace('pie', '', 1)
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

This version uses the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" in each iteration, ensuring that overlapping occurrences are handled correctly.
