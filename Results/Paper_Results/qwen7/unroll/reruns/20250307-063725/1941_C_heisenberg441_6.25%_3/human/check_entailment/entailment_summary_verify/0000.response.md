### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summary in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to:
- Return 1 if the substring 'pie' is not present in `s`.
- Otherwise, it removes all occurrences of 'pie' from `s` and returns the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.

However, the actual implementation of `func_1(s)` does not match this summary. Instead, it:
- Removes all occurrences of 'map' and counts them.
- Removes all occurrences of 'pie' and counts them.
- Returns the total count of removals.

This means the function does not check for the presence of 'pie' directly and instead removes both 'map' and 'pie' substrings and counts their occurrences.

#### Program Analysis:
The program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and prints the result. The function `func_1(s)` iterates through the string `s` and removes all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie', counting each removal.

#### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement and see if the program behaves as expected.

1. **Test Case: "mmapnapie"**
   - Initial string: "mmapnapie"
   - First removal: "map" -> "mmnapie"
   - Second removal: "pie" -> "mmnap"
   - Total removals: 2

2. **Test Case: "azabazapi"**
   - Initial string: "azabazapi"
   - No 'map' or 'pie' -> No removals
   - Total removals: 0

3. **Test Case: "mappppie"**
   - Initial string: "mappppie"
   - First removal: "map" -> "pppie"
   - Second removal: "pie" -> "ppp"
   - Total removals: 2

4. **Test Case: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"**
   - Initial string: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"
   - First removal: "map" -> "mapmapmapmapmap"
   - Second removal: "map" -> "mapmapmapmap"
   - Third removal: "map" -> "mapmapmap"
   - Fourth removal: "map" -> "mapmap"
   - Fifth removal: "map" -> "map"
   - Sixth removal: "map" -> ""
   - Total removals: 6

5. **Test Case: "p"**
   - Initial string: "p"
   - No 'map' or 'pie' -> No removals
   - Total removals: 0

6. **Test Case: "pppiepieeee"**
   - Initial string: "pppiepieeee"
   - First removal: "pie" -> "pppieeee"
   - Second removal: "pie" -> "pppee"
   - Total removals: 2

From the above examples, we can see that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful by removing all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'. This matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which is incorrect based on our analysis. The program correctly implements the logic to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

**Final: True**
