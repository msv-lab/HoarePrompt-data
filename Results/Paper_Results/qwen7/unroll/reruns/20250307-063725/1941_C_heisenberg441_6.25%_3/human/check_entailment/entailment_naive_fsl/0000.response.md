Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program only checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them, but it does not account for overlapping occurrences of these substrings. For example, in the string "mapmapmap", the program will incorrectly remove characters, leading to more deletions than necessary. 

To illustrate, consider the string "mapmapmap":
- The program finds "map" at index 0, removes it, resulting in "mapmap".
- It then finds "map" at index 1, removes it, resulting in "map".
- Finally, it finds "map" at index 2, removes it, resulting in an empty string, which requires 3 deletions.

However, the optimal solution would be to remove only 2 characters to make the string "mapmapmap" beautiful, such as removing the second and fourth 'm' characters, resulting in "mmpmap".

Thus, the program does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, making it incorrect.
