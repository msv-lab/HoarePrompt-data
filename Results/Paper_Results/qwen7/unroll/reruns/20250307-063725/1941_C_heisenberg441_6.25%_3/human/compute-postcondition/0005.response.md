Output State: **The string `s` no longer contains the substring 'map', and the variable `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is present in the string `s`. Each iteration of the loop removes the first occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1. Once all occurrences of 'map' are removed, the condition `s.find('map') != -1` becomes false, and the loop terminates. Therefore, `ans` will be the total count of how many times 'map' was found and removed from `s`, and `s` will no longer contain the substring 'map'.
