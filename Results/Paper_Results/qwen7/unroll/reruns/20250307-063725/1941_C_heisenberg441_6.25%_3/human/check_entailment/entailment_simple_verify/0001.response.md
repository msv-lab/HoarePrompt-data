### Reasoning:

1. **Original Assessment Analysis:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies a flaw in the `func_1` function where it only removes the first occurrence of "map" or "pie" and does not recheck the string after each removal.
   - The assessment suggests a corrected version of the function that ensures both "map" and "pie" are checked and removed in each iteration until neither exists in the string.

2. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after each operation within the `func_1` function.
   - The annotated code shows that the function correctly removes "map" and "pie" substrings but does not recheck the string after each removal, leading to the same flaw identified in the original assessment.

3. **Corrected Version of `func_1`:**
   - The suggested corrected version of the function ensures that the string is rechecked after each removal, which is necessary to handle cases where removing one instance of "map" or "pie" might create a new instance of the other substring.

4. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Given the flaw in the original `func_1` function and the need for rechecking after each removal, the original program is indeed incorrect.
   - The suggested corrected version addresses this flaw, but the original program as written does not.

### Final:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not recheck the string after each removal of "map" or "pie," which can lead to an incorrect count of deletions.
