Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n \). It then calculates the minimum cost to travel between consecutive points in the list using the formula \( \min(a \cdot (m_i - m_{i-1}), b) \) and subtracts this cost from \( f \). If \( f \) remains positive after processing all points, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for \( t \) test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). The function outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the final value of \( f \).**
