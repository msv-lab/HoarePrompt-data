Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge might become negative due to continuous usage without sufficient breaks. Specifically, consider the following test case:

```
3 11 9 6
6 8 10
```

- At moment 0, the phone has 11 units of charge.
- From moment 0 to moment 6, the phone loses 9 units of charge, leaving 2 units.
- From moment 6 to moment 8, the phone loses another 9 units of charge, resulting in -7 units of charge, which is not possible.

The program should account for the charge becoming negative and handle the situation appropriately by turning off the phone and consuming the necessary energy. However, the current implementation does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
