#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. Additionally, a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n is provided where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the while loop based on whether the variable `f` remains positive after executing the loop body.
    #
    #Explanation: For each iteration of the while loop, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` are updated according to the input provided. The loop calculates the minimum cost (`min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`) to travel from one point to the next in the list `ls`. This cost is subtracted from `f`. If `f` is still greater than 0 after processing all points (from 1 to n), it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing each test case, `t` is decremented by 1 until `t` becomes 0, indicating all iterations are complete.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n \). It then calculates the minimum cost to travel between consecutive points in the list using the formula \( \min(a \cdot (m_i - m_{i-1}), b) \) and subtracts this cost from \( f \). If \( f \) remains positive after processing all points, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for \( t \) test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). The function outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the final value of \( f \).
