Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the while loop based on whether the variable `f` remains positive after executing the loop body.

Explanation: For each iteration of the while loop, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` are updated according to the input provided. The loop calculates the minimum cost (`min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`) to travel from one point to the next in the list `ls`. This cost is subtracted from `f`. If `f` is still greater than 0 after processing all points (from 1 to n), it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing each test case, `t` is decremented by 1 until `t` becomes 0, indicating all iterations are complete.
