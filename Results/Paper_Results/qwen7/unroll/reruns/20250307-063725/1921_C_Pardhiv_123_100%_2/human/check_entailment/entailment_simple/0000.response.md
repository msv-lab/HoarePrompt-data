Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, and constructs the list `ls` which includes the initial charge at position 0 and the required send times.
3. It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from index 1 (the first send time).
4. Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum cost to either send the message directly or to turn off and on the phone before sending the message.
5. The cost calculation ensures that the phone's charge is sufficient to send the message at the current time or to turn off and on the phone.
6. After processing all messages, it checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than 0 and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
7. The decrement of `t` ensures that the loop runs for each test case exactly once.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and should handle the constraints and requirements as specified.

Correctness: **True**
