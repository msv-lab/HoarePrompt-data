Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Charge Calculation**: The program subtracts `min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` from `f` in each iteration, but this logic is flawed. The correct approach should consider whether turning off and on the phone is beneficial compared to just letting the phone run continuously.

2. **Turning Off and On Logic**: The program does not properly account for the scenario where turning off and on the phone might save more charge than losing it continuously. It simply checks if the remaining charge is greater than 0 after processing all messages, which is insufficient.

3. **Overflow Risk**: The program uses `int` for all calculations, which might lead to overflow issues with large inputs, especially for the difference between `ls[i]` and `ls[i-1]`.

To fix these issues, the program should:
- Calculate the total charge loss if the phone runs continuously.
- Compare this with the charge loss if the phone is turned off and on at strategic points.
- Ensure the logic handles edge cases and large inputs correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate minimum charge needed to send all messages
        min_charge_needed = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            min_charge_needed += max(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        # Check if the initial charge is enough
        if f >= min_charge_needed:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This version calculates the minimum charge required to send all messages and compares it with the initial charge to determine if it's possible to send all messages.
