Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on whether the variable `f` remains positive after the inner loop executes.

Explanation: For each iteration of the outer while loop, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` (which is represented here as `ls`) are taken as inputs. The inner for loop updates the value of `f` by subtracting the minimum cost (`min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`) from it for each segment between consecutive elements in the list `ls`. If `f` is still greater than 0 after processing all segments, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.
