### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if Stepan can send all \( n \) messages with the given initial charge \( f \), charge loss rate \( a \), and cost of turning off and on the phone \( b \).
   - If the phone's charge drops to 0 or below at any moment, Stepan cannot send a message at that moment.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It then reads the sequence of message sending times into a list `ls`.
   - The loop iterates through the message sending times, updating the phone's charge based on whether it turns off and on or sends a message directly.
     - For each message, it calculates the minimum cost between sending the message directly (which costs \( a \times (ls[i] - ls[i-1]) \)) and turning off and on (which costs \( b \)).
     - It updates the charge accordingly.
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the final charge is greater than 0. If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for calculating the charge after each message is correct. The code correctly handles both scenarios: sending a message directly and turning off/on the phone.
   - The use of `min` ensures that the most cost-effective option is chosen for each message.
   - The loop correctly processes all messages in order.
   - The final check to see if the charge is greater than 0 is appropriate.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the phone's charge might drop to 0 exactly at the moment of sending a message.
   - The code also handles the case where turning off and on might be necessary to save charge.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to 0 or below.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
