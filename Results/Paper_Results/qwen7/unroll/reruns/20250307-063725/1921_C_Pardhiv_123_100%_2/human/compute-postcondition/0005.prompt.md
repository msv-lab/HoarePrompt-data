You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. Additionally, a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n is provided where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the while loop based on whether the variable `f` remains positive after executing the loop body.
    #
    #Explanation: For each iteration of the while loop, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` are updated according to the input provided. The loop calculates the minimum cost (`min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`) to travel from one point to the next in the list `ls`. This cost is subtracted from `f`. If `f` is still greater than 0 after processing all points (from 1 to n), it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing each test case, `t` is decremented by 1 until `t` becomes 0, indicating all iterations are complete.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers. It first checks if the integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) is within the specified range. Then, for each test case, it processes four integers n, f, a, and b (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9), and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}). The function returns a result based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
