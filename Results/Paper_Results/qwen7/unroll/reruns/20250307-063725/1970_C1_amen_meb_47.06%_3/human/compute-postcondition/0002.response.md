Output State: The `numbers` list will contain all the pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered until a line with less than 2 numbers is entered.

In the final output state, the `numbers` list will be populated with all the pairs of integers provided as input until an iteration where the input does not consist of exactly two numbers. The variables `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` will retain their initial values, and the loop will terminate once an input line with fewer than two elements is encountered.
