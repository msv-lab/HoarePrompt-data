Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes input lines containing pairs of integers (num1, num2) until a line with fewer than two elements is encountered. During this process, it retains the initial values of variables `t`, `u`, and `v`. Upon completion, it returns a list named 'numbers' containing all pairs of integers processed.**
