You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The tree is represented by its edges, ensuring it has exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])
        
        numbers.append([num1, num2])
        
    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains 1, `u` and `v` remain their initial values (which are not specified but are integers between 1 and `n`), and the `numbers` list will contain all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered until a line with less than 2 numbers is entered.
    #
    #In more detail, the `numbers` list will be populated with all the pairs of integers provided as input until an input line with fewer than two elements is encountered. The variables `t`, `u`, and `v` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list named 'numbers' that contains all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered as input until a line with fewer than two elements is encountered. Variables `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes input lines containing pairs of integers (num1, num2) until a line with fewer than two elements is encountered. During this process, it retains the initial values of variables `t`, `u`, and `v`. Upon completion, it returns a list named 'numbers' containing all pairs of integers processed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'numbers' that contains all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered as input until a line with fewer than two elements is encountered. Variables `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
