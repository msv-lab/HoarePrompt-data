Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to read pairs of numbers from input, but the problem does not require reading input during runtime. Instead, the input is provided as part of the problem description, and the program should determine the winner based on the given tree structure and initial node positions without additional input.

The program incorrectly reads input using `func_1`, which is unnecessary and leads to an incorrect implementation. Additionally, the logic inside the main part of the program does not correctly simulate the game rounds or determine the winner based on optimal play. The variables `Ron_co` and `Hib_co` are not relevant to the game logic described, and the comparison between them does not accurately reflect the game's outcome.

To fix this, the program should directly analyze the tree structure and the initial node positions to determine the winner without reading any additional input.
