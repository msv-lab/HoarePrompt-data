State right before the while loop: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `numbers` is an empty list.

The only variable in the loop head is the condition `True`, which means the loop will always execute. However, since there are no conditions inside the loop head that depend on any variables, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.
