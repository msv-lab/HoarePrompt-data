#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element. The tree is represented by its edges, ensuring it has exactly two leaves.
def func_1():
    numbers = []
    while True:
        nums = input().split()
        
        if len(nums) != 2:
            break
        
        num1 = int(nums[0])
        
        num2 = int(nums[1])

    #State: Output State: The variable `t` remains 1, `u` and `v` remain their initial values (which are not specified but are integers between 1 and `n`), and the `numbers` list will contain all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered until a line with less than 2 numbers is entered.
    #
    #In more detail, the `numbers` list will be populated with all the pairs of integers provided as input until an input line with fewer than two elements is encountered. The variables `t`, `u`, and `v` will retain their initial values since they are not modified within the loop.
    return numbers
    #The program returns a list named 'numbers' that contains all pairs of integers (num1, num2) entered as input until a line with fewer than two elements is encountered. Variables `t`, `u`, and `v` retain their initial values.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and processes input lines containing pairs of integers (num1, num2) until a line with fewer than two elements is encountered. It retains the initial values of variables `t`, `u`, and `v` throughout the process. Upon completion, it returns a list named 'numbers' containing all pairs of integers processed.
