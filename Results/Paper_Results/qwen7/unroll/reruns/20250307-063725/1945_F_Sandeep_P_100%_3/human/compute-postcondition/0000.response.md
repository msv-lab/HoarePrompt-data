Output State: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, n is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The decorator definition does not affect the values of these variables.**

The given code snippet defines a decorator but does not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `n`, `v`, `p`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.
