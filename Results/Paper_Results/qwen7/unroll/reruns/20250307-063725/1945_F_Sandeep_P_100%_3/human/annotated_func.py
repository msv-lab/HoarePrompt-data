#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the number of mushrooms, v is a list of n positive integers where each integer represents the magic power of a mushroom, and p is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the function decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a decorated function named `decorating_function`. This decorated function is designed to handle recursive calls by returning `fillvalue` when such a call occurs.
