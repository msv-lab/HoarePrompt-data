Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then processing each test case individually. This is evident from the loop `for _ in range(t):`.

2. **Base Case**: For the base case where `x == 2`, the program correctly outputs `1` followed by `0`. This matches the expected output for this specific value of `x`.

3. **General Case**: For other values of `x`, the program attempts to construct an array that results in exactly `x` increasing subsequences. The logic used involves breaking down `x` into powers of 2 and constructing the array accordingly. However, the current implementation has a flaw in how it constructs the array and calculates the length of the array.

4. **Flaw in Array Construction**: The current approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `x` increasing subsequences. Specifically, the construction of `ansv` does not follow a proven algorithm for generating arrays with a specific number of increasing subsequences. The provided logic for constructing `ansv` is incorrect and does not ensure the desired outcome.

5. **Output Length Mismatch**: The output length is calculated incorrectly. The variable `mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` where `2 ** (i - 1)` is a factor of `x`. However, the length of `ansv` is calculated as `len(ansv)`, which is `mx - 1`. This does not match the intended length of the array.

6. **Example Analysis**:
   - For `x = 5`, the correct output should be an array of length 3 with elements `[0, 1, 0]` because it has exactly 5 increasing subsequences.
   - For `x = 13`, the correct output should be an array of length 5 with elements `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` because it has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
   - For `x = 37`, the correct output should be an array of length 7 with elements `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` because it has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly generate arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
