You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `x` from the user. If `x` is 2, it prints 1 followed by 0 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence of integers based on certain conditions and prints the length of this sequence followed by its elements, each separated by a space. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences `X`. The program needs to handle up to 1000 test cases, where `X` ranges from 2 to \(10^{18}\).

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be determined using the properties of binomial coefficients. Specifically, for an array of length `n`, the number of increasing subsequences is given by the sum of binomial coefficients \(\sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} = 2^n\). Therefore, we need to decompose `X` into powers of 2 to construct the array.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `X`.
   - It attempts to decompose `X` into powers of 2.
   - It constructs the array based on the decomposition.
   - The construction logic seems to be flawed because:
     - It uses a loop to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and subtracts it from `X`.
     - It appends the index of the power of 2 minus one to `subseq_lens`.
     - It constructs the array `ansv` based on `subseq_lens`.

4. **Flaws in the Program**:
   - The program does not correctly handle the decomposition of `X` into powers of 2. For example, if `X` is 13, it should be decomposed into \(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0\), but the program incorrectly handles this.
   - The constructed array `ansv` does not necessarily produce the correct number of increasing subsequences. The logic to append elements to `ansv` is flawed.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Decompose `X` into powers of 2.
   - Construct the array such that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the flawed decomposition and array construction logic. A correct implementation would need to properly handle the decomposition and ensure the array construction produces the exact number of increasing subsequences.

**Correctness: False**
