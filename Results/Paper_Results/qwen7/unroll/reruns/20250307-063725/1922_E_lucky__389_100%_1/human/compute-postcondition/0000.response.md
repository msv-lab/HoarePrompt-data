Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18 (input value).**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The value of `x` is now the integer input, which is within the specified range of 2 to \(10^{18}\).
