Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value of `i - 1` where `2 ** (i - 1)` divides `x`, `t` remains unchanged, `x` becomes 0, and `subseq_lens` is a list of all such `i - 1` values in decreasing order.**

Explanation: The loop iterates as long as `x` is not zero. In each iteration, it finds the highest power of 2 that divides `x` (excluding 2^0), subtracts that power of 2 from `x`, and appends the corresponding value of `i - 1` to `subseq_lens`. The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `i - 1` found during these operations. Once `x` becomes zero, the loop terminates, and `x` is set to 0, `t` remains unchanged, and `subseq_lens` contains all the values of `i - 1` collected during the loop's execution.
