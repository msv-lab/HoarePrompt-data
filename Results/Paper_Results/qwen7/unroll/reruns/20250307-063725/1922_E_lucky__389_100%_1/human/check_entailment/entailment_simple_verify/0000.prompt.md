You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the required number of increasing subsequences (`X`) cannot be achieved with an array of length at most 200.

For example, consider the case where `X = 37`. According to the problem description, the program should output an array that has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation generates an array of length `mx` (which is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X`) and appends additional elements based on the binary representation of `X`. This approach does not guarantee that the generated array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences, especially for larger values of `X`.

To illustrate, let's manually check the case for `X = 37`:
- The binary representation of 37 is `100101`.
- The program would generate an array of length 6 (since \(2^5 = 32\) and \(37 - 32 = 5\)), which is `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3]`.
- However, this array does not necessarily have exactly 37 increasing subsequences. For instance, the subsequence `[0, 1, 2, 3]` is counted multiple times, leading to an incorrect count.

Therefore, the program does not correctly generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
