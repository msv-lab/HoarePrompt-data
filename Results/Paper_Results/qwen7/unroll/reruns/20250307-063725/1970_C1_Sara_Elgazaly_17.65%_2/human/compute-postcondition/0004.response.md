Output State: **`s` is True, x is an integer input from the first split, y is an integer input from the second split, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict where each key (node) has a list of its adjacent nodes.**

The code simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `s`. Since no other operations are performed on any of the existing variables, their values remain unchanged. The condition and values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the structure of `lst` also remain the same as per the initial state.
