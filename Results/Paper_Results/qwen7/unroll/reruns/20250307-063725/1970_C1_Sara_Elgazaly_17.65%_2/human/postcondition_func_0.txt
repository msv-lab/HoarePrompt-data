The function reads two integers from input, constructs an undirected graph using adjacency lists, and then traverses the graph to determine if a certain condition is met. If the traversal ends without visiting any more nodes, it prints 'Hermione'; otherwise, it prints 'Ron'. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.
