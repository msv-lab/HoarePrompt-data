Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the first split, `y` is an integer input from the second split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `x` and `y`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the list of starting nodes remain unchanged.
