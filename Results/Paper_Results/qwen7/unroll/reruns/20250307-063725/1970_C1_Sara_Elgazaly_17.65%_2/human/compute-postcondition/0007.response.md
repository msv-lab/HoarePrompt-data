Output State: **`s` is True**

The initial state of `s` is False. The code `s = not s` changes the value of `s` to the opposite of its current value. Since `s` was initially False, after executing the code, `s` becomes True. The states of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `lst`) remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.
