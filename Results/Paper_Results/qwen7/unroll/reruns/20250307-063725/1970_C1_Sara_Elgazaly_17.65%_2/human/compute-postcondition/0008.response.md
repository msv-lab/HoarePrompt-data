Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The initial state is given as `s` is True.
2. The code snippet contains a conditional expression: `'Hermione' if s else 'Ron'`.
3. In Python, the conditional expression evaluates the condition `s`. If `s` is `True`, it returns the first part of the expression, which is `'Hermione'`. If `s` is `False`, it would return the second part of the expression, which is `'Ron'`.
4. Since `s` is explicitly stated to be `True`, the expression will evaluate to `'Hermione'`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **'Hermione'**
