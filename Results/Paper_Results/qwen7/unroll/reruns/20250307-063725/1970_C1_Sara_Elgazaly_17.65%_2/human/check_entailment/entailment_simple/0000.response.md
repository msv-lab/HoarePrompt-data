Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of nodes \( n \) and the number of rounds \( t \) (which is fixed at 1).
2. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the provided edges.
3. The core logic of the program is in the while loop:
   - It iterates through the tree starting from the initial node.
   - It keeps moving the stone to an inactive neighbor until it reaches a node with no inactive neighbors.
   - The boolean variable `s` toggles between `True` and `False` with each move, effectively simulating the turns between Ron and Hermione.
4. After the loop, `s` is toggled once more to finalize the turn count.
5. Finally, it prints "Hermione" if `s` is `False`, otherwise "Ron". This correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the number of moves.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly simulate the game and determine the winner based on optimal play.

Correctness: **True**
