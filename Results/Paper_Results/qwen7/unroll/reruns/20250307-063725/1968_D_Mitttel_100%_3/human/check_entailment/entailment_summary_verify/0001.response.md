### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It converts the permutation `p` and the array `a` into zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem statement uses 1-based indexing, but the code uses 0-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - The loop iterates until `k` turns are completed or the position has been visited before.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), decrements `k`, and updates the position `s` to the next position in the permutation.
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the starting positions might lead to cycles or the game might end without completing all `k` turns.
   - The use of `vis` ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop due to cycles in the permutation.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly calculates the maximum possible score for a given starting position.
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores and prints the appropriate result.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a subtle issue with the implementation of `func_1`. Specifically, the function does not account for the possibility that a player might choose to stay at their current position instead of moving to the next position in the permutation. This is crucial because the problem statement specifies that on each turn, a player can either stay at their current position or move to the next position in the permutation.

### Detailed Analysis:

- In the `while` loop of `func_1`, the player always moves to the next position in the permutation regardless of whether they choose to stay or move.
- The function should allow the player to decide whether to stay or move, which would involve additional logic to consider both options.

### Example Counterexample:

Consider the following test case:
- \( n = 3 \)
- \( k = 2 \)
- \( p = [2, 3, 1] \)
- \( a = [1, 2, 3] \)
- \( P_B = 1 \)
- \( P_S = 2 \)

- **Bodya's Path:**
  - Start at position 1.
  - Turn 1: Stay at position 1 (score = 1).
  - Turn 2: Move to position 2 (score = 1 + 2 = 3).

- **Sasha's Path:**
  - Start at position 2.
  - Turn 1: Stay at position 2 (score = 2).
  - Turn 2: Move to position 3 (score = 2 + 3 = 5).

In this scenario, Sasha ends up with a higher score (5) compared to Bodya (3), even though the program incorrectly assumes that both players always move to the next position in the permutation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the decision-making process for staying or moving, leading to potential incorrect results.
