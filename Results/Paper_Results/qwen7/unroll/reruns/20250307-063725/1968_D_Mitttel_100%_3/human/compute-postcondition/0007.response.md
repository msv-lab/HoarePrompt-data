Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers from 1 to n `p`, a list of two integers `s` representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and a positive integer `k` representing the duration of the game. It returns the maximum value of 'cur + k * a[s]', where 'cur' is the sum of 'a[s]' for all steps taken, 'k' is 0, and 'vis[s]' indicates that position 's' has been visited.**
