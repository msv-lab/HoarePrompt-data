Output State: **`mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game.**

Explanation: The line `mx = 0` initializes the variable `mx` to 0. No other changes are made to the other variables, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
