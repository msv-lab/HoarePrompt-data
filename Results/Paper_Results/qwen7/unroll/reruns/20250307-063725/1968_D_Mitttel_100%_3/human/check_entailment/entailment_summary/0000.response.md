Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly implements the logic for calculating the scores for both players.
2. The main loop iterates over the test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `func_1` function.
3. The `func_1` function correctly simulates the game for a single starting position, updating the current score and the maximum possible score based on the remaining turns.
4. The logic for determining the winner (Bodya, Sasha, or Draw) is implemented correctly after calling `func_1` for both starting positions.
5. The input handling and the conversion of indices to 0-based indexing are also correct.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
