### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:

The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum possible score for a player starting from a given position `s` over `k` turns. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its logic:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Length of the permutation.
   - `mx`: Maximum score encountered.
   - `cur`: Current score.
   - `vis`: A list to keep track of visited positions.

2. **Traversal**:
   - The function uses a while loop to traverse the permutation starting from position `s`.
   - It marks the current position as visited.
   - It updates `mx` with the maximum of `mx` and `cur + k * a[s]`.
   - It adds `a[s]` to `cur`.
   - It decrements `k` by 1.
   - It updates `s` to `p[s]`.

3. **Return**:
   - The function returns `mx`, which represents the maximum score achievable starting from position `s`.

#### Correctness of `func_1`:

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for calculating the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position. It accounts for the possibility of revisiting positions and ensures that the maximum score is updated appropriately. The function does not miss any potential maximum scores because it continues to update `mx` as it traverses the permutation.

#### Analysis of the Main Program:

The main program reads the input and calls `func_1` for both players' starting positions. It then compares the results and prints the appropriate outcome.

1. **Input Reading**:
   - Reads the number of test cases, `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - Reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Position Adjustment**:
   - Adjusts the positions in `p` and `a` to be zero-indexed.

3. **Function Calls**:
   - Calls `func_1` for both players' starting positions.
   - Compares the results and prints the appropriate outcome.

Given that `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score for a given starting position, the main program should work correctly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because `func_1` does not account for revisiting positions. However, upon detailed analysis, `func_1` does indeed account for revisiting positions and correctly calculates the maximum score. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided.
