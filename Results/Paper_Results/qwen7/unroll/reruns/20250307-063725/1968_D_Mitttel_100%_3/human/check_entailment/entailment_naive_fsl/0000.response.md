Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the game. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not account for the possibility of moving back to the previous position after moving to `p[s]`. This means that the function might miss out on potential maximum scores that could be achieved by revisiting positions.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
4 2 3 2
4 1 2 3
7 2 5 6
```

**Expected Output:**
- Bodya starts at position 3.
- Sasha starts at position 2.
- After the first turn:
  - Bodya's score: \(5\) (stays at position 3).
  - Sasha's score: \(2 + 7 = 9\) (moves to position 1).
- After the second turn:
  - Bodya's score: \(5 + 5 = 10\) (stays at position 3).
  - Sasha's score: \(9 + 2 = 11\) (stays at position 1).

In this case, Sasha has a higher score, so the expected output should be "Sasha".

However, the provided program does not handle the scenario where Sasha can potentially revisit position 1 and achieve a higher score. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic for the game, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
