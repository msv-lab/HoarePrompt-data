### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It converts the permutation `p` and the array `a` into zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem statement uses 1-based indexing, but the code uses 0-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - The loop iterates until `k` turns are completed or the position has been visited before.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), decrements `k`, and updates the position `s` to the next position in the permutation.
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the starting positions might lead to cycles or the game might end without completing all `k` turns.
   - The use of `vis` ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop due to cycles in the permutation.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly calculates the maximum possible score for a given starting position.
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores and prints the appropriate result.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code, there is a small mistake in the initialization of the `vis` list. The annotation states:
```python
vis = [(0) for _ in range(n)]
```
This should be:
```python
vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]
```
Using `[0 for _ in range(n)]` initializes a list of `n` zeros, which is correct. Using `[ (0) for _ in range(n) ]` would create a list of `n` tuples, each containing a single zero, which is not what is intended.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identifies the overall logic and flow of the program. However, there is a minor issue with the initialization of the `vis` list, which could potentially cause confusion but does not affect the correctness of the program's logic.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is still correct according to the problem description despite the minor annotation error.
