Output State: **`cur` is 0, `mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game, `vis` is a list of `n` elements where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `vis` where each element is set to 0. This list has a length of `n`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
