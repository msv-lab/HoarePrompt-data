### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It converts the permutation `p` and the array `a` into zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem statement uses 1-based indexing, but the code uses 0-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - The loop iterates until `k` turns are completed or the position has been visited before.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), decrements `k`, and updates the position `s` to the next position in the permutation.
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the starting positions might lead to cycles or the game might end without completing all `k` turns.
   - The use of `vis` ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop due to cycles in the permutation.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly calculates the maximum possible score for a given starting position.
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores and prints the appropriate result.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description.
