Output State: **The output state will be `cur` equal to the sum of `a[s]` for all steps taken, `mx` equal to the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop, `vis[s]` equal to 1 indicating the position `s` has been visited, and `k` equal to 0 as it has been decremented to 0 in the loop.**

To break it down:
- `cur` accumulates the sum of `a[s]` at each step.
- `mx` keeps track of the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the loop.
- `vis[s]` is set to 1 once the position `s` is visited.
- `k` is decremented by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0, stopping the loop.
