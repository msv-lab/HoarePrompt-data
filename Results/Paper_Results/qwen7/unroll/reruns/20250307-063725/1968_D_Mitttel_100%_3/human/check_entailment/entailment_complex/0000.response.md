Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It uses a loop to traverse the permutation `p` starting from position `s`.
   - The variable `cur` keeps track of the cumulative score, and `mx` stores the maximum score achieved during the traversal.
   - The loop continues until `k` becomes 0 or all positions have been visited.
   - The function correctly updates `cur` and `mx` based on the rules of the game.

2. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the necessary inputs and converts them into appropriate data structures.
   - The positions `pb` and `ps` are adjusted by subtracting 1 (since indices in Python start from 0).
   - The function `func_1` is called twice to compute the scores for Bodya and Sasha starting from their respective positions.
   - The program correctly compares the scores and prints the result based on the comparison.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints appropriately, such as the range of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the values of `a` and `p`.
   - The logic for determining the winner based on the scores is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
