Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` over `k` turns.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed. Specifically, it assumes that the player will always stay at the current position until the last turn, which is not necessarily true. The player can move to `p[s]` at any point during the turns.

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The main loop in the program calls `func_1` for both players' starting positions. However, `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's rules, particularly the simultaneous movement and scoring mechanism.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the permutation might lead to cycles or where the player might revisit the same position multiple times within the `k` turns.

To fix these issues, the program needs to accurately simulate the game's rules. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def simulate_game(a, p, start, k):
    n = len(p)
    score = 0
    position = start - 1
    for _ in range(k):
        score += a[position]
        position = p[position] - 1
    return score

for _ in range(int(input())):
    (n, k, pb, ps) = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Adjust indices to be 0-based
    for i in range(n):
        p[i] -= 1
        a[i] -= 1
    
    bodya_score = simulate_game(a, p, pb, k)
    sasha_score = simulate_game(a, p, ps, k)
    
    if bodya_score == sasha_score:
        print('Draw')
    elif bodya_score > sasha_score:
        print('Bodya')
    else:
        print('Sasha')
```

This corrected version simulates the game properly by following the rules of the game, ensuring that both players' scores are calculated correctly based on their movements and scores at each step.
