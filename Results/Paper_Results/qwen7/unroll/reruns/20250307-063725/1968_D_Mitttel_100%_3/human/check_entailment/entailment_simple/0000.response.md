Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions in a permutation and the scores they accumulate over a specified number of turns. The key logic involves calculating the maximum possible score a player can achieve given their starting position and the rules of movement.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: \( n \), \( k \), \( p \) (permutation), and \( a \) (array).
   - It adjusts the indices in the permutation and array by subtracting 1.
   - It calls the `func_1` function for both Bodya and Sasha's starting positions.
   - Based on the returned values from `func_1`, it determines the winner or if it's a draw.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position \( s \) over \( k \) turns.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game turns, updating the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) encountered.
   - The loop continues until all positions have been visited or \( k \) turns are exhausted.
   - The function returns the maximum score (`mx`) calculated.

4. **Key Points**:
   - The code correctly simulates the game for both players.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum possible score for a given starting position.
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct based on the scores returned by `func_1`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where both players end up with the same score by returning "Draw".
   - It correctly handles the decrement of \( k \) and ensures that the loop terminates properly.

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game.

Correctness: **True**
