Output State: **`cur` is 0, `mx` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of the list `p`, `a` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, `s` is a list of two integers representing the starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, and `k` is a positive integer representing the duration of the game.**

Explanation: The line `cur = 0` initializes the variable `cur` to 0. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of `mx`, `n`, `a`, `p`, `s`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
