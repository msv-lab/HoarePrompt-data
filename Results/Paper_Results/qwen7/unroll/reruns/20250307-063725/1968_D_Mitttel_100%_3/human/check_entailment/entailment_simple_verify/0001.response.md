### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Preparation:**
   - The program correctly parses the input for each test case.
   - It converts the permutation `p` and the array `a` into zero-based indices by subtracting 1 from each element. This is necessary because the problem statement uses 1-based indexing, but the code uses 0-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` to store the maximum score, `cur` to store the current score, and `vis` to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - The loop iterates until `k` turns are completed or the position has been visited before.
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current score (`cur`), decrements `k`, and updates the position `s` to the next position in the permutation.
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main part of the program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - Depending on the comparison, it prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the starting positions might lead to cycles or the game might end without completing all `k` turns.
   - The use of `vis` ensures that the program does not get stuck in an infinite loop due to cycles in the permutation.

5. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound and correctly calculates the maximum possible score for a given starting position.
   - The main logic correctly compares the scores and prints the appropriate result.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:

- The annotated code matches the original assessment, and the comments accurately describe the state of the program at key points.
- The `vis` list is initialized with zeros, which is correct since it needs to track visited positions.
- The loop in `func_1` correctly simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the score and position appropriately.
- The function returns the maximum score calculated, which is used in the main logic to determine the winner.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum possible score for each player and determines the winner based on these scores. The use of the `vis` list ensures that the program avoids cycles and correctly handles the game mechanics.
