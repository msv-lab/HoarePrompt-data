Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers from 1 to n `p`, a list of two integers `s` representing the starting positions, and a positive integer `k` representing the duration of the game. It traverses through the permutation starting from the given positions, updating the current sum (`cur`) and the maximum value (`mx`) of `cur + k * a[s]` encountered during the traversal. Once `k` reaches 0 or all positions have been visited, it returns the maximum value of `cur + k * a[s]` found.**
