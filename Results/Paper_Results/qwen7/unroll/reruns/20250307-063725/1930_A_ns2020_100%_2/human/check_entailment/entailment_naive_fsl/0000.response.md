Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem description. It sorts the list of numbers and then sums up the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which effectively pairs the smallest available numbers together in each step. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is maximized, leading to the highest possible score. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach guarantees the optimal solution for all valid inputs.
