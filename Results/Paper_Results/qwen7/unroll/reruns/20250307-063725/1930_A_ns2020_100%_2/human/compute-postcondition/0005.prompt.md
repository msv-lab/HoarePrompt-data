You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of sums of every second element from each list `A`, sorted in ascending order, printed for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: For each value of `t`, the code reads an integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers. It then sorts the list `A` in ascending order and prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element. This process repeats until `t` becomes zero. Since `t` starts as an integer between 1 and 5000, the loop will execute that many times, each time processing a new list `A`. The final output state consists of the sums of every second element from each processed list, printed in the order they were processed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a specified range for t and n, and an array of 2n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_{2n}. It returns a result based on certain conditions involving these values.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
