### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that the score is increased by \(\min(x, y)\), and these integers are removed from the list. The process is repeated \(n\) times.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves sorting the array and summing up every other element starting from the smallest. This ensures that the minimum of each pair is maximized at each step.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A`.
   - It then sums up every other element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.), which corresponds to the optimal strategy.
   - Finally, it prints the sum.

4. **Verification**:
   - For the first test case (`2 3`), sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `2`.
   - For the second test case (`1 1 2 1`), sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case (`1 1 1 1 1 1`), sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy and produces the expected results.
