Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**.

The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and the code simply reads an integer from input and assigns it to `t`, the updated state of `t` is that it is now an input integer within the specified range. The other conditions and variables remain unchanged.
