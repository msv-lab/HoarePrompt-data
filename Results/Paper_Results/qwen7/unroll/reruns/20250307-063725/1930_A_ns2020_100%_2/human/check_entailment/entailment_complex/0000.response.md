Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, the program sorts the list of integers `A` in ascending order. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which maximizes the score since we always take the minimum of the two chosen integers.
3. **Sum Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (`sum(A[::2])`). This effectively pairs the smallest elements together, ensuring that the score is maximized.
4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated sum for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the function, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
