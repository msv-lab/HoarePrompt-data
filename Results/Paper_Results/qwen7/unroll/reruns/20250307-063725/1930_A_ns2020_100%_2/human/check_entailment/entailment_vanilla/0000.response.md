### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers and adding the minimum of the pair to the score, repeating this process `n` times until all numbers are used.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the array `A` of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the array `A` in ascending order.
   - It then calculates the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[::2]`), which corresponds to selecting the smaller elements in each pair.
   - This approach works because sorting ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired together, maximizing the score at each step.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - Sorting the array and summing every other element starting from the first element ensures that the smallest possible values are chosen in each pairing, which aligns with the optimal strategy.
   - The algorithm correctly implements the logic required to achieve the maximum score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the sorting and summing correctly for any valid input within the constraints provided.
   - It processes each test case independently, ensuring that the results for different test cases do not interfere with each other.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum score according to the problem statement.
