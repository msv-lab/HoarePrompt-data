Output State: The output state will be a series of sums of every second element from each list `A`, sorted in ascending order, printed for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each value of `t`, the code reads an integer `n` and a list `A` of `n` integers. It then sorts the list `A` in ascending order and prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element. This process repeats until `t` becomes zero. Since `t` starts as an integer between 1 and 5000, the loop will execute that many times, each time processing a new list `A`. The final output state consists of the sums of every second element from each processed list, printed in the order they were processed.
