Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`. It then sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
3. **Scoring Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the sum of every other element starting from the first element (`A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.). This is equivalent to taking the minimum of pairs `(A[i], A[i+1])` for all `i` and summing them up, which maximizes the score.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the calculated score for each test case.

This approach works because when the array is sorted, the optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available elements together, ensuring that the sum of the minimums is maximized. The program correctly implements this strategy.

Given the problem constraints and the logic used, the provided program is correct.
