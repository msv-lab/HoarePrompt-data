Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum score by selecting pairs of integers from the list and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
2. The provided solution sorts the list of integers in ascending order and then sums every second element starting from the first element. This approach works because sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, maximizing the minimum value added to the score at each step.
3. For example, in the second test case:
   - Input: `1 1 2 1`
   - Sorted: `1 1 1 2`
   - Sum of every second element starting from the first: `1 + 1 = 2`
4. This method correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.
5. The program processes each test case independently and outputs the result for each case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the required algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
