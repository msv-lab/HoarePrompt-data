Output State: The output state will be a list of sums of every second smallest number from each test case's sorted list of integers.

Explanation: The loop processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list and prints the sum of every second element in the sorted list. After processing all `t` test cases, the final output state will consist of these sums for each test case.
