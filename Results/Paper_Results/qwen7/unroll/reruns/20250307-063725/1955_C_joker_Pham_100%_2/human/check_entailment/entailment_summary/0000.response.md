Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of each ship.
3. The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the attacks and count the number of ships that sink.
4. The logic in `func_1` checks the durability of the ships at the left (`l`) and right (`r`) ends of the list and performs attacks accordingly.
5. The conditions for attacking and updating the durability values are handled correctly.
6. The function breaks the loop when there are no more attacks left or when the current ship's durability is less than the remaining attacks.
7. The final count of sunk ships is returned correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
