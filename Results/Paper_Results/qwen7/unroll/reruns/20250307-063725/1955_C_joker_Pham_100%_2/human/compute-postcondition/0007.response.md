Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 with a length equal to `n`). It processes the list `a` by performing operations based on the value of `k` and counts the number of successful operations that meet specific conditions. After executing these operations, it returns the total count of successful operations (`sunks`).**
