Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` of ship durabilities. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It uses a `while` loop to simulate the attacks until `l` exceeds `r`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero, breaking the loop if true.
   - It handles the special case where `l` equals `r` separately.
   - For the general case, it checks whether the leftmost or rightmost ship has lower durability and performs the corresponding attack, reducing `k` appropriately and updating the durability of the other ship if necessary.
   - It increments the `sunks` counter whenever a ship sinks.
   - The logic seems to handle the conditions correctly, ensuring that ships are only attacked once they sink.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where a ship sinks before the next attack (either from the left or right).
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where `k` is exactly enough to sink a ship but not enough to sink another one in the same attack.

4. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns the total number of ships that sank, which is the expected output.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
