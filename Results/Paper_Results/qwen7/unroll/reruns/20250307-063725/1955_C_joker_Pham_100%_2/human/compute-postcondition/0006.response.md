Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 with a length equal to `n`. It returns `sunks`, which is the total count of successful operations that met the specified conditions during the loop's execution.**
