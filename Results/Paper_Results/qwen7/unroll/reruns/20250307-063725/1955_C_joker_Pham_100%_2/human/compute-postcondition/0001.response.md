Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, where the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `sunks` to 0. All other variables retain their initial values from the precondition.
