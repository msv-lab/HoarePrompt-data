You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 (where the length of `a` is equal to `n`), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, and `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, there are several conditions that can cause the loop to break early or modify the values of `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and increment the `sunks` counter. After each iteration, either `l` is incremented, `r` is decremented, or both. The loop will terminate when `l` exceeds `r`. At the end of the loop, `l` will be set to `n` and `r` will be set to `-1`, indicating that all possible valid operations within the loop have been performed. The value of `sunks` will be the total count of successful operations that met the specified conditions during the loop's execution.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the total count of successful operations that met the specified conditions during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 with a length equal to `n`). It processes the list `a` by performing operations based on the value of `k` and counts the number of successful operations that meet specific conditions. After executing these operations, it returns the total count of successful operations (`sunks`).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durabilities of the ships `a`.

2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, which is expected.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there are any remaining attacks (`k > 0`).
   - If the left and right pointers are at the same position, it handles the case where both ships have the same durability or one of them is about to sink.
   - If the durability of the left ship is less than or equal to the right ship, it performs the attack on the left ship first. It checks if the number of attacks can sink the left ship completely and adjust the remaining attacks accordingly. If the left ship sinks, it increments the count of sunk ships and moves the left pointer.
   - If the durability of the right ship is less than the left ship, it performs the attack on the right ship first. Similar logic applies here.
   - The loop continues until there are no more attacks or the pointers meet in the middle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the left and right ships have the same durability.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the number of attacks is exactly enough to sink a ship.
   - The function ensures that ships that have already sunk are not attacked again.

5. **Output**: The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
