Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durability of the ships `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the appropriate arguments, which is correct.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It iterates while `l` is less than or equal to `r`.
   - For each iteration, it checks if `k` is zero, which would cause an immediate exit from the loop.
   - It handles the case where `l` and `r` are the same, reducing `k` by the durability of the single remaining ship if possible.
   - It then checks whether the leftmost or rightmost ship should be attacked based on their durabilities, reducing `k` accordingly and updating the durability of the other ship if necessary.
   - The function correctly increments the `sunks` counter when a ship sinks.
   - The loop terminates when `l` exceeds `r`, and the function returns the total number of sunk ships.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `l` and `r` are the same, ensuring that only one ship is considered.
   - It correctly reduces `k` and updates the durability of the ships based on the remaining attacks.
   - The logic ensures that a ship sinks when its durability reaches zero, and the loop exits appropriately.

5. **Output**: The function returns the correct number of sunk ships, which is consistent with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
