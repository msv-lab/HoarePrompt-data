Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem as described:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Durabilities**: The logic inside `func_1` does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks. Specifically, the logic for reducing the durability of ships and determining when a ship sinks is flawed.
   
2. **Incorrect Break Conditions**: The conditions under which the loop breaks are not correctly implemented. For instance, the check `if k == 0:` should be placed before the inner checks to ensure that the loop exits early if there are no more attacks left.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Sunk Ships**: The variable `sunks` is incremented incorrectly. It should be incremented only when a ship's durability reaches zero, but the current implementation increments it multiple times unnecessarily.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, k, a))

def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r and k > 0:
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                k -= a[r]
                break
            break
        if a[l] <= a[r]:
            if k >= a[l]:
                k -= a[l]
                a[r] -= a[l]
                if a[r] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    r -= 1
                l += 1
            else:
                break
        else:
            if k >= a[r]:
                k -= a[r]
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:
                    sunks += 1
                    l += 1
                r -= 1
            else:
                break
    return sunks
```

This corrected version ensures that the durability of ships is reduced correctly and that the number of sunk ships is calculated accurately.
