Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durabilities of the ships `a`.

2. **Function Call**: It calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate parameters, which is expected.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there are any remaining attacks (`k > 0`).
   - If the left and right pointers are at the same position, it handles the case where both ships have the same durability or one of them is about to sink.
   - If the durability of the left ship is less than or equal to the right ship, it performs the attack on the left ship first. It checks if the number of attacks can sink the left ship completely and adjust the remaining attacks accordingly. If the left ship sinks, it increments the count of sunk ships and moves the left pointer.
   - If the durability of the right ship is less than the left ship, it performs the attack on the right ship first. Similar logic applies here.
   - The loop continues until there are no more attacks or the pointers meet in the middle.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the left and right ships have the same durability.
   - It also correctly handles the scenario where the number of attacks is exactly enough to sink a ship.
   - The function ensures that ships that have already sunk are not attacked again.

5. **Output**: The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
