The loop condition is `l <= r`. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, the values of `l` and `r` need to satisfy this condition.

Right before the loop, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute the first time, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `r` is always `n - 1`, which means `r` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5 - 1\).

Since `l` is 0, which is a constant, and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `l <= r` is always satisfied because 0 is less than or equal to any positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5 - 1\).

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the variables `l` and `r` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding \(10^9\) where the length of `a` is equal to `n`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, and `sunks` is 0**
