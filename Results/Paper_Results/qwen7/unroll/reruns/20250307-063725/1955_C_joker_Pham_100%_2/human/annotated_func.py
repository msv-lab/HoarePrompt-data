    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 (where the length of `a` is equal to `n`), `l` is `n`, `r` is `-1`, and `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times the conditions inside the loop were satisfied.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, there are several conditions that can cause the loop to break early or modify the values of `k`, `a[l]`, `a[r]`, and increment the `sunks` counter. After each iteration, either `l` is incremented, `r` is decremented, or both. The loop will terminate when `l` exceeds `r`. At the end of the loop, `l` will be set to `n` and `r` will be set to `-1`, indicating that all possible valid operations within the loop have been performed. The value of `sunks` will be the total count of successful operations that met the specified conditions during the loop's execution.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the total count of successful operations that met the specified conditions during the loop's execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `k` (a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15), and `a` (a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9 with a length equal to `n`). It processes the list `a` by performing operations based on the value of `k` and counts the number of successful operations that meet specific conditions. After executing these operations, it returns the total count of successful operations (`sunks`).
