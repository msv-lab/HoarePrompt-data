Reasoning:

The provided solution has a few issues in terms of logic and implementation, which do not align with the problem's requirements. Let's break down the problem and the given solution to identify these issues:

1. **Problem Requirement**: The goal is to make all elements of the array equal using the minimum cost of operations. Each operation can set a subarray to a single value and costs `(j - i + 1)` burles.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not actually perform any operations to make the array elements equal. Instead, it calculates the maximum distance between the first and last occurrences of the most frequent element in the array.
   - The logic in the function does not consider the cost of operations or how to minimize the total cost to make all elements equal.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the optimal way to make all elements equal with the minimum cost. One efficient approach is to use dynamic programming or a greedy strategy to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
   - We should iterate through the array and keep track of the minimum cost required to make all elements from the start up to the current position equal.

4. **Example Verification**:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the correct answer should be 4, but the provided solution would incorrectly return 0 because it doesn't account for the actual cost of operations.

Given these points, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
