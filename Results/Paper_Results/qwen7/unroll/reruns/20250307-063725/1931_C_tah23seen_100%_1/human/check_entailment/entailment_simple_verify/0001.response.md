### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part is correct and well-handled.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The logic in `func_1` involves finding the first and last positions where the elements differ from their adjacent elements.
   - Specifically, `i` is incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i+1]`, and `j` is decremented until `arr[j] != arr[j-1]`.
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum cost is flawed. The function only considers the first and last differing elements without checking the entire array for potential cheaper operations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire array is already uniform, the function should return 0, which it does when `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.
   - If the array is not uniform, the function attempts to minimize the cost by considering the smallest possible range that needs to be changed.
   - The current implementation does not ensure that the minimum cost is found. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The function would incorrectly suggest changing the entire array, but the optimal solution is to change the middle section `[2, 3, 2]` to a single value, which costs 3 burles.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, but due to the flawed logic, the results may be incorrect.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples do not cover all edge cases, such as arrays with multiple segments of differing values. The examples provided do not reveal the flaw in the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic only considers the first and last differing elements without checking the entire array for potential cheaper operations.

### Final:
**False**
