Reasoning:

The provided program has a main loop that reads input and calls the function `func_1` to compute the result for each test case. However, the function `func_1` itself does not correctly solve the problem described. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function starts by finding the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
   - It then finds the last index `j` where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j - 1]`.
   - If the first and last elements are the same (`arr[0] == arr[-1]`), it calculates `j - i - 1` and ensures it's at least 0.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j` and ensures it's at least 0.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The goal is to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation, where the cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)`.
   - The optimal strategy involves identifying the longest subarray of identical elements and changing the rest of the array to match that subarray.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` does not consider the actual values of the elements but only their positions.
   - It does not handle the scenario where the entire array needs to be changed to a single value.
   - It also does not account for the possibility of changing the entire array to match the first or last element.

Given these points, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
