Output State: **`i` is 0; `n` is the length of `arr`**.

In this case, the variable `i` retains its initial value of 0. The new variable `n` is assigned the length of the list `arr`. Since the initial value of `i` is not affected by the code, it remains unchanged. The length of `arr` is calculated and stored in `n`.
