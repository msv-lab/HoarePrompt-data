### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The logic in `func_1` involves finding the first and last positions where the elements differ from their adjacent elements.
   - Specifically, `i` is incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i+1]`, and `j` is decremented until `arr[j] != arr[j-1]`.
   - If the first element equals the last element, the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire array is already uniform, the function should return 0, which it does when `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.
   - If the array is not uniform, the function attempts to minimize the cost by considering the smallest possible range that needs to be changed.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is correct.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the function. For instance, in the first example, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` requires changing the middle section to make all elements equal, costing 4 burles.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to handle the problem correctly according to the provided problem description and examples.
