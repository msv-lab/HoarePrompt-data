### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The logic in `func_1` involves finding the first and last positions where the elements differ from their adjacent elements.
   - Specifically, `i` is incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i+1]`, and `j` is decremented until `arr[j] != arr[j-1]`.
   - However, there is a flaw in the logic used to determine the optimal range to change. The current implementation only considers the first and last differing elements, but it does not necessarily find the minimum cost range.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire array is already uniform, the function should return 0, which it does when `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.
   - This part is correct.
   - However, the function does not consider other potential ranges that might have a lower cost. For example, in the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function would incorrectly identify the range `[2, 4]` as the minimum cost range, but the optimal range could be `[1, 5]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is correct in terms of format, but the correctness of the output depends on the logic within `func_1`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the function in some cases, but they do not cover all edge cases. For instance, the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` should ideally be considered as a whole to achieve the minimum cost, but the current implementation fails to do so.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum cost range to make all elements equal. The logic only considers the first and last differing elements, which may not always yield the optimal solution.

### Final:
**False**
