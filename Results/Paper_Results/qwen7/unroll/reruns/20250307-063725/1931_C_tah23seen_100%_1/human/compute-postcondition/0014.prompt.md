You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The sum of all lengths n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or equal to len(arr) if there are no consecutive duplicates.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: j is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or equal to 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means it will continue to decrement `j` until it either finds a non-duplicate element or reaches the start of the array. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `j` will be the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and i is 0 since arr[0] is equal to arr[-1]
    #State: `j` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or equal to 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `arr` is `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The sum of all lengths `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
#
#The function has two possible return values:
#- Case_1: It returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and `i` is 0 since `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`.
#- Case_2: It returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, ensuring the result is at least 0.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and `i` is 0 since `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`. Alternatively, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, ensuring the result is at least 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the maximum value between j - i - 1 and 0, where j is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and i is 0 since arr[0] is equal to arr[-1]

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
