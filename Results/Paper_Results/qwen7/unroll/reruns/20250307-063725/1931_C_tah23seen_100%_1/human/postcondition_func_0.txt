The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers and returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and `i` is 0 since `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`. Alternatively, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, ensuring the result is at least 0.
