Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0**, where `n` is the length of the list `arr`, `i` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr` (or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates), and `arr[0]` is not equal to `arr[-1]`.
