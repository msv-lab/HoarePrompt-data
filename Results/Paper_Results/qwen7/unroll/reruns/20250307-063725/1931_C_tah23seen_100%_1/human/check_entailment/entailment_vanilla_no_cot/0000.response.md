Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The function `func_1` does not properly handle the logic required to find the optimal range `[i, j]` where the array elements can be set to a common value `x`. Instead, it checks for consecutive identical elements and calculates the range incorrectly.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not consider scenarios where the array has multiple distinct values and needs to be made uniform with a single operation. For instance, it fails to handle arrays with more than two distinct values efficiently.

3. **Logic Flaws**: The logic inside the function does not correctly identify the optimal segment to apply the operation. Specifically, it does not account for the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which should involve checking the frequency of each element and deciding the best segment to change.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Identify the unique elements in the array.
- Calculate the cost of making all elements equal to each unique element.
- Choose the option with the minimum cost.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Count the frequency of each element
    freq = {}
    for num in arr:
        if num in freq:
            freq[num] += 1
        else:
            freq[num] = 1
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the cost for each unique element
    for num, count in freq.items():
        cost = n - count
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    print(min_cost)
    
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
