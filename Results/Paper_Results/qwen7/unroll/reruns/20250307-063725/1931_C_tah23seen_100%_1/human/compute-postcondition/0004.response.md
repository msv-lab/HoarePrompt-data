Output State: **i is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or equal to len(arr) if there are no consecutive duplicates.**

Explanation: The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`. This means it skips over all consecutive duplicate elements. After the loop finishes, `i` will be pointing to the first element that is not a duplicate of its predecessor, or `len(arr)` if there were no consecutive duplicates in the array.
