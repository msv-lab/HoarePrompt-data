Output State: j is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or equal to 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates.

Explanation: The loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means that `j` will keep decreasing until it points to either a non-duplicate element or the start of the array. Therefore, after the loop finishes, `j` will be the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates.
