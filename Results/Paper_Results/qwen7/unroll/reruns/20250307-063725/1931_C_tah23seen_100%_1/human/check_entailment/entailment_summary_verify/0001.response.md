### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the problem description.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The logic in `func_1` involves finding the first and last positions where the elements differ from their adjacent elements.
   - Specifically, `i` is incremented until `arr[i] != arr[i+1]`, and `j` is decremented until `arr[j] != arr[j-1]`.
   - If the first element equals the last element, the function returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the entire array is already uniform, the function should return 0, which it does when `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.
   - However, the function does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is uniform but the first and last elements are different. In such cases, the function should return 0 because no operation is needed.
   - The current implementation only checks if `arr[0] == arr[-1]` and returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)` if true, which is incorrect.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1` for each test case, which is correct if the function were implemented correctly.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the function in some cases, but not in others. For instance, in the third example, the array `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]` should require changing the middle section to make all elements equal, costing 2 burles. However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 6 burles.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the entire array is uniform but the first and last elements are different. The function should return 0 in such cases, but it does not.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
