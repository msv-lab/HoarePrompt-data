Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the array to find the first index `i` where the sequence breaks (i.e., where the next element is different from the current one).
   - It then iterates backward to find the last index `j` where the sequence breaks (i.e., where the previous element is different from the current one).
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, the function calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform (all elements are the same), the function correctly returns 0.
   - If the array has no consecutive duplicates, the function correctly identifies `i` and `j` such that `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of the array, leading to a cost of 0.
   - The logic for calculating the cost ensures that the minimum number of operations is used to make all elements equal.

4. **Output**: The function correctly returns the minimum number of burles required to make all elements of the array equal.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the function `func_1` appears to handle all edge cases and correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Correctness: **True**
