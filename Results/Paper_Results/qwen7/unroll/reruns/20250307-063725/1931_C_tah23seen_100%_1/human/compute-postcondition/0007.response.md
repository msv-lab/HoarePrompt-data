Output State: j is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in arr, or equal to 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates.

Explanation: The given loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means it will continue to decrement `j` until it either finds a non-duplicate element or reaches the start of the array. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `j` will be the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates.
