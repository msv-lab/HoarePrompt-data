The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list `arr` is `n` (where 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive. The sum of all lengths `n` across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

The function has two possible return values:
- Case_1: It returns the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and `i` is 0 since `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`.
- Case_2: It returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, ensuring the result is at least 0.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the maximum value between `j - i - 1` and 0, where `j` is the index just after the last consecutive duplicate element in `arr`, or 0 if there are no consecutive duplicates, and `i` is 0 since `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`. Alternatively, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and `j`, ensuring the result is at least 0.
