Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `a` and a number of queries `m`. For each test case, it initializes a list `b` and updates it based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. It then handles `m` queries, each involving two indices `x_i` and `y_i`, and prints the difference between the values at these indices in the list `b`. The function does not return any value but outputs the results of the queries.**
