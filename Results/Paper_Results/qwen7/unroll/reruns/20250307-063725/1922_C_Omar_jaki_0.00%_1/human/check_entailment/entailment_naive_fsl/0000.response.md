Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities using a complex formula involving `b` and `a`, but this approach is fundamentally flawed.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest City Distances**: The program tries to calculate distances using a series of operations involving `b` and `a`, but these calculations do not accurately reflect the closest city distances as described in the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program uses a precomputed array `b` to determine the minimum cost for each query, but the way `b` is computed does not align with the problem's requirements. The distances between cities should be calculated based on the closest city concept, and the program does not correctly implement this logic.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  5
  0 8 12 15 20
  5
  1 4
  1 5
  3 4
  3 2
  5 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  3
  8
  1
  4
  14
  ```

- **Actual Output** (using the provided program):
  The output will not match the expected output because the program does not correctly compute the closest city distances and the minimum cost for each query.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
