Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two integers `n` and `m`, and does not return anything directly but processes `m` queries. Each query consists of two integers `x_i` and `y_i` within the range [1, n] and checks if the elements at positions `x_i` and `y_i` in the list `a` satisfy certain conditions.**

Note: The actual processing logic for the queries is not described here, only the parameters and their expected behavior.
