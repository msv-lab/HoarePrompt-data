Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a series of ships with varying durability. The Kraken attacks in a specific pattern (first ship, then last ship, repeating), reducing the durability of the ships by 1 each time until they sink.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The program reads input data for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes a deque with the durability values of the ships and processes the attacks according to the specified pattern.
   - The `func_1` function handles the logic for processing the attacks.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function uses a deque to efficiently access and modify the durability values of the ships.
   - It iterates through the attacks, reducing the durability of the ships at the front and back of the deque.
   - If the durability of a ship drops to 0, it is considered sunk and counted towards the total number of sunk ships (`ans`).
   - The loop continues until there are fewer than two ships left or the remaining durability can no longer be reduced by the remaining attacks.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where the last remaining ship is still under attack but cannot be sunk further.
   - It ensures that the number of sunk ships is accurately counted by checking the remaining durability and the number of remaining ships.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships after processing all the attacks.

Given the detailed logic and edge case handling within the function, the program appears to correctly simulate the attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
