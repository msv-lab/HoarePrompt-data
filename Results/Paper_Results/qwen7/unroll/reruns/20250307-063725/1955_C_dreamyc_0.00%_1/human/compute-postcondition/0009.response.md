Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process, or simply `ans`, which is the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.**
