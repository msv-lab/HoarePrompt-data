#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #State: Output State: The deque `nums` will contain at most one element, and the variable `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
    #
    #Explanation: During each iteration of the loop, the two largest elements (or the largest elements if they are equal) from the ends of the deque are compared and reduced by their minimum value until the remaining values are less than or equal to half of `k`. If either of the reduced values is still greater than 0, it is placed back at the appropriate end of the deque. If a value becomes 0 or negative, it contributes to the count in `ans`. The loop continues until `k` is less than twice the smallest of the two compared elements or the deque has fewer than two elements left. Thus, the final state will have either one remaining element in the deque or the deque could be empty, and `ans` will reflect the total number of elements that were reduced to 0 or negative.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` reflects the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
    #State: The deque `nums` contains at most one element, and the variable `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process. The deque has more than one element, or `k` is less than `nums[0]` and `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly comparing and reducing the two largest elements at the ends of a deque representation of `nums`. It counts the number of elements that become zero or negative during this process. If the final state of the deque contains exactly one element and this element is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the count plus one; otherwise, it returns the count.
