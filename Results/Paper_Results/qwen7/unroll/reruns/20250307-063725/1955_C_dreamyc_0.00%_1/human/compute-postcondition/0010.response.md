Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly comparing and reducing the two largest elements at the ends of a deque representation of `nums`. It counts the number of elements that become zero or negative during this process. If the final state of the deque contains exactly one element and this element is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the count plus one; otherwise, it returns the count.**
