You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The deque `nums` will contain at most one element, and the variable `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
    #
    #Explanation: During each iteration of the loop, the two largest elements (or the largest elements if they are equal) from the ends of the deque are compared and reduced by their minimum value until the remaining values are less than or equal to half of `k`. If either of the reduced values is still greater than 0, it is placed back at the appropriate end of the deque. If a value becomes 0 or negative, it contributes to the count in `ans`. The loop continues until `k` is less than twice the smallest of the two compared elements or the deque has fewer than two elements left. Thus, the final state will have either one remaining element in the deque or the deque could be empty, and `ans` will reflect the total number of elements that were reduced to 0 or negative.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` reflects the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
    #State: The deque `nums` contains at most one element, and the variable `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process. The deque has more than one element, or `k` is less than `nums[0]` and `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a ship's durability is reduced to zero but is still subject to further attacks. Specifically, the program does not correctly account for the scenario where a ship's durability is reduced to zero and then the Kraken continues to attack it, which should not happen since the ship has already sunk.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 5
1 2 4 3
```
According to the problem description, the sequence of events should be:
1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, reducing its durability to 0. Now the array is `[2, 4, 3]`.
2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, reducing its durability to 2. Now the array is `[2, 4, 2]`.
3. The Kraken attacks the first ship again, reducing its durability to 1. Now the array is `[1, 4, 2]`.
4. The Kraken attacks the last ship again, reducing its durability to 1. Now the array is `[1, 4, 1]`.
5. The Kraken attacks the first ship again, reducing its durability to 0. Now the array is `[4, 1]`.

However, the program incorrectly handles the reduction of the first ship's durability to 0 and then continues to attack it, leading to an incorrect count of sunk ships. The correct number of sunk ships should be 2, but the program might incorrectly count more due to the way it handles the remaining attacks on the first ship after it has sunk.
