You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x

        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    if k and len(nums) == 1 and (k >= nums[0]):
        return ans + 1

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a positive integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function processes the elements in `nums` by repeatedly comparing and reducing the two largest elements at the ends of a deque representation of `nums`. It counts the number of elements that become zero or negative during this process. If the final state of the deque contains exactly one element and this element is less than or equal to `k`, the function returns the count plus one; otherwise, it returns the count.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durabilities of the ships `nums`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` to process the attacks and determine the number of sunk ships.
4. The function `func_1` uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends and ensures the correct logic for reducing the durability and counting the sunk ships.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:
- It initializes a deque with the ship durabilities.
- It enters a loop where it continues to attack until either there are fewer than 2 ships left or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).
- In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (ships), calculates the minimum durability between them, and reduces their durability accordingly.
- If the durability of either ship is reduced to zero, it increments the count of sunk ships.
- If there is only one ship left and it still has durability remaining, it checks if there are enough attacks left to sink it and updates the answer accordingly.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships according to the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.
