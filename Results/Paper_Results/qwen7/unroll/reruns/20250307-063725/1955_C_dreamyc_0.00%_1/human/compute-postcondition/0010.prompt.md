You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and nums is a list of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        a, b = nums.popleft(), nums.pop()
        
        x = min(a, b)
        
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The deque `nums` will contain at most one element, and the variable `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
    #
    #Explanation: During each iteration of the loop, the two largest elements (or the largest elements if they are equal) from the ends of the deque are compared and reduced by their minimum value until the remaining values are less than or equal to half of `k`. If either of the reduced values is still greater than 0, it is placed back at the appropriate end of the deque. If a value becomes 0 or negative, it contributes to the count in `ans`. The loop continues until `k` is less than twice the smallest of the two compared elements or the deque has fewer than two elements left. Thus, the final state will have either one remaining element in the deque or the deque could be empty, and `ans` will reflect the total number of elements that were reduced to 0 or negative.
    if (k and len(nums) == 1 and k >= nums[0]) :
        return ans + 1
        #The program returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` reflects the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
    #State: The deque `nums` contains at most one element, and the variable `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process. The deque has more than one element, or `k` is less than `nums[0]` and `len(nums)` is 1.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans, which is the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `nums` is a list of `n` positive integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns either `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process, or simply `ans`, which is the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` reflects the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.

Case_2: The program returns ans, which is the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
