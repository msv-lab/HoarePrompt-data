Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for handling the remaining attacks when there are fewer than two ships left is incorrect. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Attacks**: 
   - The current implementation checks if `len(nums) == 1` and `k >= nums[0]`. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to handle the remaining attacks correctly.
   - After the main loop, if there is one ship left, the number of attacks `k` should be applied to this ship. If `k` is greater than or equal to the remaining durability of the ship, the ship will sink, and we need to increment the count of sunk ships accordingly.

2. **Simplified Fix**:
   - After the main loop, check if there is one ship left in the deque (`nums`). If so, calculate how many attacks are needed to sink this ship and add that to the answer.

Here is the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    nums = deque(nums)
    ans = 0
    while k and len(nums) >= 2:
        (a, b) = (nums.popleft(), nums.pop())
        x = min(a, b)
        if k >= 2 * x:
            a -= x
            b -= x
            k -= 2 * x
        else:
            break
        if a > 0:
            nums.appendleft(a)
        else:
            ans += 1
        if b > 0:
            nums.append(b)
        else:
            ans += 1
    # Handle the case where there is one ship left
    if k and len(nums) == 1:
        if k >= nums[0]:
            ans += 1
    return ans
```

This fix ensures that the remaining attacks are correctly applied to the last ship, if any, and updates the count of sunk ships accordingly.
