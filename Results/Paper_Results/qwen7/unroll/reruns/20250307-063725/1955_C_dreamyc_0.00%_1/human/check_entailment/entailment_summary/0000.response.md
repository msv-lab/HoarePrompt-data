Reasoning:
1. The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a list of ships with varying durability.
2. The provided code uses a deque to efficiently manage the removal of ships from both ends.
3. The logic inside `func_1` correctly handles the reduction of durability by alternating between the first and last elements of the deque.
4. The function correctly increments the count (`ans`) whenever a ship's durability reaches zero.
5. After processing, the function checks if there is a single remaining ship and if the remaining durability is sufficient to sink it, adding one more to the count if necessary.
6. The overall structure and logic of the function match the problem description and the expected behavior.

Given these points, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
