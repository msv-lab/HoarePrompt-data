Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a deque of n positive integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `nums = deque(nums)` converts the list `nums` into a deque (double-ended queue). This changes the data structure of `nums` but does not alter the values or the conditions specified for `t`, `n`, `k`, or the elements within `nums`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the properties of `nums` remain the same as in the initial state.
