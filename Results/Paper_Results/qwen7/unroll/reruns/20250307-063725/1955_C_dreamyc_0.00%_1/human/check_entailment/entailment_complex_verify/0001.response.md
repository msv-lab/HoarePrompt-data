### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durabilities of the ships `nums`.
   - It initializes a deque with the ship durabilities, which is a good choice as it allows efficient popping from both ends.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` processes the attacks and determines the number of sunk ships.
   - It uses a deque to efficiently manage the ships' durabilities.
   - The loop continues until either there are fewer than 2 ships left or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (ships), calculates the minimum durability between them, and reduces their durability accordingly.
   - If the durability of either ship is reduced to zero, it increments the count of sunk ships.
   - After the loop, it checks if there is only one ship left and if there are enough attacks left to sink it, updating the answer accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases and Correctness**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the deque might have only one element left and checks if there are enough attacks to sink it.
   - The logic for reducing the durability and counting the sunk ships is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The use of a deque ensures that the program can efficiently handle the repeated popping from both ends, which is crucial for the Kraken's attacking pattern.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound and correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks and the sinking of ships.
   - The function `func_1` accurately counts the number of sunk ships based on the given rules.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program correctly simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships according to the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.
