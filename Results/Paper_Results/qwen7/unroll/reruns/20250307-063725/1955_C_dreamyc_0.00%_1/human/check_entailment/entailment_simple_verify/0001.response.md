### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durabilities of the ships `nums`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function initializes a deque with the ship durabilities.
   - It enters a loop where it continues to attack until either there are fewer than 2 ships left or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).
   - In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (ships), calculates the minimum durability between them, and reduces their durability accordingly.
   - If the durability of either ship is reduced to zero, it increments the count of sunk ships.
   - After the loop, it checks if there is only one ship left and it still has durability remaining. If there are enough attacks left to sink it, it increments the count of sunk ships.

3. **Key Points to Validate:**
   - The use of a deque allows efficient popping from both ends, which matches the problem's requirement of attacking the first and last ships alternately.
   - The logic for reducing the durability and counting the sunk ships is correctly implemented.
   - The handling of the remaining single ship at the end is also correctly addressed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when there are fewer than 2 ships left or when there are no more attacks left.
   - It correctly accounts for the scenario where the last remaining ship is still durable and needs additional attacks to sink it.

5. **Overall Correctness:**
   - The program accurately simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships according to the problem statement.
   - There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to simulate the attacks and count the number of sunk ships.
