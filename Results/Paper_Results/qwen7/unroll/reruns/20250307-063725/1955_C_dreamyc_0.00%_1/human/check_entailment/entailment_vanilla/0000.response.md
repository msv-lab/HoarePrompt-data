Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `T` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n`, the number of attacks `k`, and the durabilities of the ships `nums`.
3. It calls the function `func_1` to process the attacks and determine the number of sunk ships.
4. The function `func_1` uses a deque to efficiently pop from both ends and ensures the correct logic for reducing the durability and counting the sunk ships.

Let's analyze the function `func_1`:
- It initializes a deque with the ship durabilities.
- It enters a loop where it continues to attack until either there are fewer than 2 ships left or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).
- In each iteration, it pops the first and last elements (ships), calculates the minimum durability between them, and reduces their durability accordingly.
- If the durability of either ship is reduced to zero, it increments the count of sunk ships.
- If there is only one ship left and it still has durability remaining, it checks if there are enough attacks left to sink it and updates the answer accordingly.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly simulates the attacks and counts the number of sunk ships according to the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or inconsistencies in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
