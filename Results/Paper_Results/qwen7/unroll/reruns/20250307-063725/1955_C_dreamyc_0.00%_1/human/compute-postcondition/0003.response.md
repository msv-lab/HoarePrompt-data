Output State: The deque `nums` will contain at most one element, and `ans` will be the count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.

Explanation: During each iteration of the loop, the two largest numbers from the deque are compared and reduced by their minimum value until the remaining sum is less than `2 * x`. If either number becomes positive after reduction, it is placed back into the deque. If a number becomes zero or negative, it contributes to the `ans` counter. The loop continues until either `k` is exhausted or the deque has fewer than 2 elements left. At the end, `ans` will reflect the total count of elements that were reduced to zero or negative, and `nums` will contain the remaining elements (if any), which cannot be further reduced with the remaining `k`.
