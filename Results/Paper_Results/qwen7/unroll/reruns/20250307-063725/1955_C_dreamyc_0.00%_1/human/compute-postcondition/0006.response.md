Output State: **The program returns the value of `ans` plus 1, where `ans` reflects the total count of elements that became zero or negative during the process.**

This means that the program will return a value that is `ans + 1`, where `ans` is the count of elements in the deque `nums` that became zero or negative. Since `nums` contains exactly one element, and this element is less than or equal to half of `k`, the exact value of `ans` is not specified, but the return value will be `ans + 1`.
