Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns the square root of `n` if the square root of `n` is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can be computed within the constraints. Otherwise, it returns an error message.**

Given the constraints, the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It calculates the square root of `n`, which is a positive integer within the range [1, 2 * 10^6], and checks if the square root of `n` is less than or equal to the maximum possible value that can be computed within the given constraints. If the condition is met, it returns the square root of `n`. If not, it returns an error message.
