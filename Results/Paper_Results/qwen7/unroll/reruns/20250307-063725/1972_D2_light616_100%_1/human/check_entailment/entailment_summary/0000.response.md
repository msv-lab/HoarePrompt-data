Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` is responsible for reading the number of test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\). It then counts the valid pairs by checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

Let's analyze the logic of `func_1`:
- It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
- For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\).
- If the condition is met, it calculates the minimum values of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x+y)y}\) and adds this to the count.

Given the constraints and the logic, the function seems to correctly implement the required algorithm. However, there is one potential issue:
- The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) should be checked directly instead of using the minimum values approach. The current implementation does not explicitly check this condition.

To ensure correctness, we need to verify if the logic of checking the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly implemented in `func_1`.

After reviewing the logic and the provided execution summary, it appears that the core logic of `func_1` is sound but needs a direct check for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: While the overall structure of the code is correct, the specific condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not being checked directly in the current implementation. This could lead to incorrect results.
