### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function processes a single test case by iterating through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checking the conditions specified in the problem description. It then prints the count of valid pairs.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) and calls `func_1` to process these values. It does not modify the value of `t` during its execution.

#### Analysis of `func_1`:
- The function uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
- For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
- If the condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is met, it calculates the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) and adds this value to the count `cnt`.

#### Analysis of `func_2`:
- The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_1` to process the values of \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Verification of Correctness:
1. **Boundary Conditions**: The function handles the boundary conditions where \(n\) and \(m\) are small, as well as large values up to \(2 \times 10^6\).
2. **GCD Condition**: The function correctly checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which is a necessary condition for the problem.
3. **Count Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the number of valid pairs by considering the constraints and the gcd condition.
4. **Multiple Test Cases**: The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and the provided function summaries, the program appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
