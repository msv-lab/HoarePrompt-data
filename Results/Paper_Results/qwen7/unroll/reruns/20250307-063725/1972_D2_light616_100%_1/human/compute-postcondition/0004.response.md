Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6. The function processes these values and returns different outputs based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function `func_2` indirectly accepts multiple sets of parameters through its test cases, specifically `t`, `n`, and `m`, and returns outputs based on the conditions provided for these parameters.
