Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- Function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the count of such pairs for a single test case. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks if the conditions are met.
- Function `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the functions seem to correctly implement the solution.
- There are no logical errors or missing parts in the provided code that would cause it to fail according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
