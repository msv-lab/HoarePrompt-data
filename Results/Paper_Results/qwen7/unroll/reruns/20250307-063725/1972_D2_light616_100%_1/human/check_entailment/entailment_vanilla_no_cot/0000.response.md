Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic inside the function is flawed. It checks pairs `(x, y)` where `1 \leq x \leq n` and `1 \leq y \leq m`, but it doesn't correctly handle the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \).
   - Specifically, the condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is unnecessary and incorrect. We need to check the condition for any pair `(a, b)` where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case. However, the implementation of `func_1` itself is incorrect as explained above.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) being a multiple of \( a + b \). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function 2 is called to process multiple test cases
func_2()
```

This corrected approach ensures that all pairs \((a, b)\) within the specified ranges are checked against the given condition.
