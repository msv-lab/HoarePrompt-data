### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic implemented in the program and validates it against the provided test cases. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `x + y` fits within the bounds.
   - For each pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` (i.e., `x` and `y` are coprime).
   - If they are coprime, it calculates the minimum value between `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` and adds it to `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to count pairs `(a, b)` such that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
   - The nested loops ensure that all valid pairs are checked within the given constraints.
   - The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the program.

4. **Efficiency**:
   - While the current approach might not be optimal for extremely large inputs, it correctly implements the logic for the given constraints and examples.

Given the detailed analysis and the correctness of the program for the provided test cases, the original assessment is accurate.
