Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function correctly initializes `cnt` to 0.
   - It reads `n` and `m` from input.
   - It iterates over `x` starting from 1 up to the square root of `n`.
   - For each `x`, it iterates over `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - It checks if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `x` and `y` is 1.
   - If the condition is met, it adds the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it prints `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function reads `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - No additional variables are defined or modified within the loop, ensuring that the state remains consistent across test cases.

3. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using `func_2` to iterate over each test case and call `func_1` for processing.
   - The logic in `func_1` accurately calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
