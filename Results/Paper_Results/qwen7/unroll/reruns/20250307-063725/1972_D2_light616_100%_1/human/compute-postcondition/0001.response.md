State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, _ is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` and the dummy variable `_`.
- The value of `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since `t` is obtained from user input and is specified to be an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, the state of `t` must reflect this constraint.
- The dummy variable `_` is used to iterate over the range but does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state needs to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.
