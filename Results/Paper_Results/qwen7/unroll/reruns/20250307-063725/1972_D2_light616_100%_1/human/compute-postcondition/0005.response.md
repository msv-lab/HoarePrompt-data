Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2,000,000) and calls another function `func_1()` to process these values. After processing all test cases, it outputs the value of `t`, which remains unchanged throughout the function execution.**
