### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its annotations step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - `x = 1`: Initialize the variable `x`.
   - `cnt = 0`: Initialize the counter `cnt` to zero.
   - `n, m = map(int, input().split())`: Read two integers `n` and `m` from the input.

2. **Outer Loop:**
   - `while x * x <= n`: Iterate over possible values of `x` such that `x * x <= n`.

3. **Inner Loop:**
   - `y = 1`: Initialize the variable `y`.
   - `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`: Iterate over possible values of `y` such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.

4. **Condition Check and Calculation:**
   - `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`: Check if the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is 1.
   - `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`: If the condition is met, add the minimum of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to `cnt`.

5. **Increment and Continue:**
   - `y += 1`: Increment `y` and continue the inner loop.
   - `x += 1`: Increment `x` and continue the outer loop.

6. **Output:**
   - `print(cnt)`: Print the total count of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t = int(input())`: Read the number of test cases `t`.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - `for _ in range(t)`: Iterate over each test case.
   - `func_1()`: Call the function `func_1` for each test case.

3. **Output:**
   - No additional output is required as `func_1` handles the printing of results for each test case.

#### Annotations Verification:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points and the logic implemented in `func_1` and `func_2`.
- The program iterates over all possible pairs \((x, y)\) within the given constraints and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- The use of `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that only pairs with a GCD of 1 are considered, which is a crucial part of the problem's requirements.
- The calculation of `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` ensures that the conditions \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) are satisfied.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. There are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
