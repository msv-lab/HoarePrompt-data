Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, the recursion limit is set to 10 ** 6**.

The code `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)` sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\). This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or any other variables. The initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged, and the constraints on `n` and `m` and the structure of the subsequent input data also remain the same.
