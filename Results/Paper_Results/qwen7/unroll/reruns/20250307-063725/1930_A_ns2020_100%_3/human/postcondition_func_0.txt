The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of every second smallest number, starting from the smallest. This sum is then printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the output consisting of these sums.
