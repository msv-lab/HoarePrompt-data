Output State: The output state will be a series of sums of every second element from each list `A`, sorted in non-decreasing order, printed for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the variable `t` is decremented by 1. The loop continues as long as `t` is greater than 0. In each iteration, the user inputs an integer `n` and then a list of `n` integers. This list is sorted, and the sum of every second element (starting from the first element) is printed. After all iterations are completed, the final output consists of these sums printed during each iteration of the loop.
