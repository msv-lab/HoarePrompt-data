Output State: The output state will consist of the sum of every second smallest number from each input list, printed for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is initially an integer input. In each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then a list `A` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `A` and prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0] + A[2] + ...`). After printing, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the final output state will be a series of sums, one for each iteration of the loop, representing the sum of every second smallest number from each input list.
