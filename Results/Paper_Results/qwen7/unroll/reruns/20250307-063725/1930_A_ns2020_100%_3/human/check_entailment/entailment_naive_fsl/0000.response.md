Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It sorts the array and then sums up the elements at even indices, which effectively adds the minimum of the pairs of elements during each move. This approach ensures that the score is maximized because the smallest elements are paired together, and their minimum values are added to the score. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this solution works for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
