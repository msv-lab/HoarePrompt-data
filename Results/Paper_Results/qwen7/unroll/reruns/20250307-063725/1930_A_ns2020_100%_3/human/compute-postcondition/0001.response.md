State right before the while loop, the variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive).
```
while t:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `t`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t` must be true in a boolean context).

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive), it is already guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**
