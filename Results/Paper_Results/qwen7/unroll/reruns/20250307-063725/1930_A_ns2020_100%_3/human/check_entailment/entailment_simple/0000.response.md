Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of `2n` integers.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - By sorting, the smallest elements are at the beginning of the list.
   - It then calculates the sum of every second element starting from the first element (`A[0] + A[2] + ...`), which corresponds to the sum of the smallest elements in pairs.
   - This approach ensures that the minimum values are always chosen for each pair, maximizing the score.
3. **Output**: The program prints the calculated sum for each test case and decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct and will produce the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
