### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the list, adding \(\min(x, y)\) to the score, and removing \(x\) and \(y\) from the list. This process is repeated \(n\) times.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available integers to minimize the loss of score. Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are always chosen first.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums up every other element starting from the first element (`A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.), which corresponds to picking the smallest elements in pairs.
   - Finally, it prints the sum, which represents the maximum score achievable.

4. **Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `2 3`. Sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `2`.
   - For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Conclusion**: The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the list and summing every other element starting from the first. This ensures that the smallest elements are always picked, maximizing the score.
