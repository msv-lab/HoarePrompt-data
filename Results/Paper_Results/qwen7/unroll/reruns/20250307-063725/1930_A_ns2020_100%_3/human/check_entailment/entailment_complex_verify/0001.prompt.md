You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        t = t - 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        A.sort()
        
        print(sum(A[::2]))
        
        t = t - 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of the sum of every second smallest number from each input list, printed for each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is initially an integer input. In each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and then a list `A` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `A` and prints the sum of every second element starting from the first element (i.e., `A[0] + A[2] + ...`). After printing, `t` is decremented by 1. Therefore, the final output state will be a series of sums, one for each iteration of the loop, representing the sum of every second smallest number from each input list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and `2n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the sum of every second smallest number, starting from the smallest. This sum is then printed for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes, leaving the output consisting of these sums.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by repeatedly selecting two integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the list, adding \(\min(x, y)\) to the score, and removing \(x\) and \(y\) from the list. This process is repeated \(n\) times.

2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to always pick the smallest available integers to minimize the loss of score. Sorting the list ensures that the smallest elements are always chosen first.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the list of integers `A`.
   - It sorts the list `A` in ascending order.
   - It then sums up every other element starting from the first element (`A[0]`, `A[2]`, `A[4]`, etc.), which corresponds to picking the smallest elements in pairs.
   - Finally, it prints the sum, which represents the maximum score achievable.

4. **Verification**:
   - For the first test case: `2 3`. Sorting gives `[2, 3]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `2`.
   - For the second test case: `1 1 2 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 2]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 = 2`.
   - For the third test case: `1 1 1 1 1 1`. Sorting gives `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Summing every other element starting from the first gives `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`.

5. **Conclusion**: The program correctly implements the optimal strategy by sorting the list and summing every other element starting from the first. This ensures that the smallest elements are always picked, maximizing the score.
