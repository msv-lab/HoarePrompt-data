Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 5000 (inclusive)**.

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, and it is guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 5000. All other preconditions remain unchanged, specifically, for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. However, these conditions will be checked and applied after the value of `t` is determined.
