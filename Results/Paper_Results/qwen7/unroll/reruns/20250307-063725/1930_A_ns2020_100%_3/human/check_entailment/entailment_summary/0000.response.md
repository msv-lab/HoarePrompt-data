Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads `2n` integers and sorts them. Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired together, which is optimal for maximizing the score since we always take the minimum of the pair.
3. **Sum Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the sum of every second element in the sorted list (`A[::2]`). This means it adds the smallest element, the third smallest element, and so on. This approach ensures that we are always taking the minimum of the pairs, thus maximizing the score.
4. **Output**: The calculated sum is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly computes the maximum final score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
