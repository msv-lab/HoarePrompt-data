Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it sorts the list of integers `A`. Sorting ensures that when we take the minimum of pairs, we are always pairing the smallest available numbers first, which maximizes the sum of the minimums.
3. **Summation of Minimum Pairs**: By taking every second element from the sorted list (`A[::2]`), the program effectively sums up the minimum values of all pairs. This is because, after sorting, the first half of the elements (when taking every second element) will always be the smaller value in each pair.
4. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case, which is the desired maximum final score.

Given these points, the program logic aligns perfectly with the problem statement and constraints, making it correct.
