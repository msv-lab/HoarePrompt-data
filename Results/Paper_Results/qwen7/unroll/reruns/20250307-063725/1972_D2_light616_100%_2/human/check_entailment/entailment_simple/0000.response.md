Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly initializes variables `x` and `cnt`.
   - It reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
   - It uses nested loops to iterate over possible values of `x` and `y` such that \(x \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).
   - For each valid pair `(x, y)` where \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\), it calculates the contribution to `cnt` as the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor\).
   - Finally, it prints the accumulated count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - This ensures that for each test case, the correct number of pairs is calculated and printed.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic in both functions appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given constraints. The program handles the input and output as specified and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
