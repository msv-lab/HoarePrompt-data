Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x\) and \(y\) represent \(a\) and \(b\) respectively).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **Inner Loop Conditions**:
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Inner Loops**:
  - The condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) ensures that \(x\) does not exceed \(n\).
  - The condition \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensures that \(y\) does not exceed \(m\).
  - These conditions are correctly implemented to avoid unnecessary computations.

- **GCD Check**:
  - The check \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) ensures that the pair \((x, y)\) is coprime.
  - This is necessary because the problem specifies that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), and this condition simplifies the calculation.

- **Count Calculation**:
  - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
  - This is a correct approach to ensure that the count is not overestimated.

- **Overall Structure**:
  - The structure of the code is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.
