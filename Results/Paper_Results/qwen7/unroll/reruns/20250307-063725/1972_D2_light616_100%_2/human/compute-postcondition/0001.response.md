State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The upper bound for `t` is given as \(10^4\), so `t` must be less than or equal to \(10^4\).
4. No other variables or states outside the loop head need adjustment since the loop does not depend on any other variables.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it meets the condition \(0 < t \leq 10^4\).
