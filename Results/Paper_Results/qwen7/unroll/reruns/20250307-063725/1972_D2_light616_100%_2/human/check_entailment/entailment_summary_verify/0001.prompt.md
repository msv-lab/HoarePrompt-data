You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n + m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It also reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). The function does not return any specific value but performs operations based on these inputs.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x\) and \(y\) represent \(a\) and \(b\) respectively).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **Inner Loop Conditions**:
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Correctness of Inner Loops**:
  - The condition \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) ensures that \(x\) does not exceed \(n\).
  - The condition \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensures that \(y\) does not exceed \(m\).
  - These conditions are correctly implemented to avoid unnecessary computations.

- **GCD Check**:
  - The check \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) ensures that the pair \((x, y)\) is coprime.
  - This is necessary because the problem specifies that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), and this condition simplifies the calculation.

- **Count Calculation**:
  - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
  - This is a correct approach to ensure that the count is not overestimated.

- **Overall Structure**:
  - The structure of the code is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic and implementation are correct according to the problem statement. The program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
