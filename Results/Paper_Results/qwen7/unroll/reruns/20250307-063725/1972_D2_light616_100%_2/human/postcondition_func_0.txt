The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \). It then calculates the sum of the minimum values of \( \frac{n}{(x+y)x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x+y)y} \) for all pairs of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the conditions \( (x+y)x \leq n \), \( (x+y)y \leq m \), and \( \text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 \). Finally, it prints the calculated sum.
