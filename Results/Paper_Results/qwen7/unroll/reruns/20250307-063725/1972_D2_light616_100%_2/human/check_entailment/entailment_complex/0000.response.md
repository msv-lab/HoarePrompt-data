Reasoning:
- Function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\) under the specified conditions.
- The logic within `func_1` iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \times x \leq n\) and checks if the pair \((x, y)\) satisfies the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). If the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \(x\) and \(y\) is 1, it calculates the contribution to the count using the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x+y)x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x+y)y}\).
- Function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, which is necessary because the problem statement specifies that there can be up to \(10^4\) test cases.
- Given the constraints and the logic, the provided functions correctly implement the solution for the problem as described.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
