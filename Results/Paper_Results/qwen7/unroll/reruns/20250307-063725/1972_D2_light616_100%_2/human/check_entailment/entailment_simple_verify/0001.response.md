### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x = 1`: Start with \(x = 1\).
   - `cnt = 0`: Initialize the count of valid pairs to 0.
   - Read \(n\) and \(m\) from input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - `while x * x <= n`: Iterate over possible values of \(x\) up to \(\sqrt{n}\).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - `y = 1`: Start with \(y = 1\).
   - `while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m`: Ensure that the product constraints are satisfied.
   - `if math.gcd(x, y) == 1`: Check if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
   - `cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`: Increment the count by the minimum of the two floor divisions.

4. **Print `cnt`**: Print the total count of valid pairs for the current test case.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Read Test Cases**:
   - `t = int(input())`: Read the number of test cases.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**:
   - `for _ in range(t)`: Iterate over each test case.
   - Call `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Annotations Recap:
- The program correctly initializes and iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
- The gcd check ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime.
- The count is updated correctly based on the constraints.
- The program handles multiple test cases as expected.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Constraints Handling**:
   - The outer loop runs up to \(\sqrt{n}\), ensuring that \(x\) does not exceed \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - The inner loop ensures that the product constraints are satisfied, avoiding unnecessary computations.

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The gcd check is crucial as it simplifies the problem by considering only coprime pairs, which is necessary for the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) to be a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count is incremented by the minimum of the two floor divisions, ensuring that the count is not overestimated.

4. **Overall Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the program is correct and follows the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
After re-evaluating the program with the provided annotations and the problem description, it is clear that the logic and implementation are correct. The program correctly counts the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
