### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the logic and implementation of the program are correct according to the problem statement. However, there are a few points to consider for a thorough validation:

1. **Nested Loop Conditions**:
   - The outer loop iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\), and the inner loop iterates over \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - This ensures that the pairs \((a, b)\) are checked within the bounds of \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **GCD Check**:
   - The \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) condition is correctly used to ensure that the pairs are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the problem.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This approach correctly calculates the number of valid pairs without overestimating.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.

Given the detailed analysis and the provided function summary, the program appears to be correct. The original assessment accurately identifies the correctness of the program.
