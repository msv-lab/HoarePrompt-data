### Reasoning:

Upon reviewing the provided code and the original assessment, I find that the original assessment is accurate. Here is a detailed breakdown of why the original assessment is correct:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x\) and \(y\) represent \(a\) and \(b\) respectively).
   - It uses a nested loop to check the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Inner Loop Conditions**:
   - The conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\) ensure that the values of \(x\) and \(y\) do not exceed their respective bounds.
   - These conditions are correctly implemented to avoid unnecessary computations.

4. **GCD Check**:
   - The check \(\gcd(x, y) == 1\) ensures that the pair \((x, y)\) is coprime.
   - This is necessary because the problem specifies that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), and this condition simplifies the calculation.

5. **Count Calculation**:
   - The count `cnt` is incremented by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).
   - This is a correct approach to ensure that the count is not overestimated.

6. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly processes multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

7. **Overall Structure**:
   - The overall structure of the code is correct and follows the problem requirements.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case.
