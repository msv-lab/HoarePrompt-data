Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has a logical error in the way it checks and counts the valid pairs `(a, b)`.

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly handled. The current implementation does not properly validate this condition for each pair `(x, y)`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_1` incorrectly calculates the count of valid pairs. It increments `cnt` based on the minimum values of `n // ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which does not align with the problem statement requirements.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and check if the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function to check correctness
def check_correctness():
    test_cases = [
        (1, 1),
        (2, 3),
        (3, 5),
        (10, 8),
        (100, 1233),
        (1000000, 1145141)
    ]
    expected_outputs = [0, 1, 1, 6, 423, 5933961]
    
    for i, (n, m) in enumerate(test_cases):
        cnt = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                    cnt += 1
        assert cnt == expected_outputs[i], f"Test case {i+1} failed: expected {expected_outputs[i]}, got {cnt}"
    print("All test cases passed.")

check_correctness()
```

This corrected approach iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring the solution is accurate.
