Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- `func_1` is designed to calculate the count of such pairs for a single test case. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.
- `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.
- The execution summary of `func_1` indicates that it correctly implements the logic to find valid pairs \((x, y)\) and sums up the counts for all valid pairs.
- The execution summary of `func_2` indicates that it correctly processes multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

Given that both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement, and there are no apparent logical errors or omissions, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
