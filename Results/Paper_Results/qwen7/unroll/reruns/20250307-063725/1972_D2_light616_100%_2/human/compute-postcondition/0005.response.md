Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \) and \( n + m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \). It also reads an integer \( t \) indicating the number of test cases, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \). The function does not return any specific value but performs operations based on these inputs.**
