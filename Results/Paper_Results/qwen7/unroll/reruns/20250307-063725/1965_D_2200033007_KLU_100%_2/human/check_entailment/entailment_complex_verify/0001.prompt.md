You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates all possible subarray sums of `a` and stores them in a new list `cts`. This list is then sorted in ascending order. The function returns the sorted list `cts` containing all these subarray sums.

After processing, it returns a list `a` consisting of `n` zeros. The middle element of `a` is set to the last value in the processed `odds` list, and all other elements remain zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates all subarray sums of an array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - Given the problem constraints, it correctly generates all subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - However, the logic in this function is flawed. It checks if the current subarray sum `ct` matches the last element in the `odds` list and removes the last element if they match. This approach will not correctly identify unique subarray sums because it only removes consecutive duplicates, not all duplicates.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to reconstruct the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros and tries to fill it based on the unique subarray sums.
   - The logic for filling the array is flawed. It assumes that the middle element can be directly derived from the unique subarray sums, which is not always true. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the array length is odd properly.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems to be a helper function for some other purpose, but it is not relevant to the main logic of solving the problem.

Given the flaws in `func_2` and `func_3`, the overall solution is incorrect. The functions do not correctly identify unique subarray sums or reconstruct the palindrome array.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in identifying unique subarray sums and reconstructing the palindrome array.
