Output State: **bigList contains all subarray sums except the last one, and smallList is empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last elements of both `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. In each iteration, both lists have their last elements removed. This process continues until either `smallList` becomes empty or the condition `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` no longer holds true. Since `smallList` is initially one element shorter than `bigList`, it will eventually become empty first, leaving `bigList` with all its elements except the last one.
