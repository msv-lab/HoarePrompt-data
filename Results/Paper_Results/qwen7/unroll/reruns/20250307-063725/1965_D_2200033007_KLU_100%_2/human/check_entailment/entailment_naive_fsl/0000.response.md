Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue.

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  3
  1 2 3 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1 2 1
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  - `func_1` generates all subarray sums and sorts them.
  - `func_2` removes duplicate sums.
  - `func_3` attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array.
  - However, the logic in `func_3` does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the palindrome array. Specifically, it does not ensure that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is correctly placed and that the array remains a palindrome.

### Issue:
- In `func_3`, the logic for assigning values to the array indices does not correctly handle the palindrome property. For instance, when `idx` is the middle index, the value assignment does not ensure that the array remains symmetric.

### Detailed Explanation:
- Consider the example with `n = 3` and subarray sums `1, 2, 3, 4, 1`.
  - After sorting and removing duplicates, the list of unique sums is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - When reconstructing the array, the middle element (when `n` is odd) is not correctly handled. The current implementation might assign values without ensuring the symmetry required for a palindrome.

To fix this, a more detailed approach is needed to ensure that the array remains a palindrome during reconstruction. The current implementation does not guarantee this property.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly recover a palindrome array in all cases.
