### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates all subarray sums of an array `a`.
   - It iterates through each starting index `i` and adds up the elements from `i` to the end of the array.
   - The resulting list `cts` contains all subarray sums in arbitrary order.
   - The function sorts `cts` before returning it, which is unnecessary since the sorting step is not used in subsequent functions.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - It iterates through `cts` and maintains a list `odds` of unique sums.
   - If the current sum `ct` is the same as the last element in `odds`, it removes the last element (removing the duplicate).
   - Otherwise, it appends the current sum to `odds`.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros with length `n`.
   - It uses an index `idx` to place values in the middle of the array and symmetrically around it.
   - For each unique sum `x` in `odds`, it calculates the value to be placed in the array and ensures the palindrome property by setting both `a[idx]` and `a[n-1-idx]` to half of the difference between the current sum and the previous sum.
   - It updates the previous sum `prev` and decrements `idx`.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems out of context.
   - It appears to be a helper function that might have been intended for some other purpose but is not utilized in the main logic.

### Analysis:
- The core logic of the solution is in `func_2` and `func_3`.
- `func_2` correctly identifies unique subarray sums.
- `func_3` constructs a palindrome array using these unique sums, ensuring the palindrome property is maintained.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should work correctly to recover any possible palindrome array `a`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem correctly based on the steps outlined above.
