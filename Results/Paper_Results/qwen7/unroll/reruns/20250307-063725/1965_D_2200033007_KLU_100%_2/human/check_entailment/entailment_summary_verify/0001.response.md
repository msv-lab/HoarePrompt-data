### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly generates all subarray sums of an array `a` and returns them sorted. Given the problem constraints, it correctly generates all subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The original assessment stated that the logic in this function is flawed because it only removes consecutive duplicates. However, upon closer inspection, the function actually aims to keep only the unique subarray sums by ensuring that each subarray sum is added only once. If a subarray sum already exists in the `odds` list, it is not appended again. Therefore, the function correctly identifies unique subarray sums.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The original assessment claimed that the logic for filling the array `a` is flawed. However, the function correctly reconstructs the palindrome array by ensuring that the elements are mirrored around the center. For even lengths, it correctly pairs the elements symmetrically. For odd lengths, the middle element is derived correctly from the unique subarray sums.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is indeed not used in the provided solution and is a helper function for some other purpose, but it is not relevant to the main logic of solving the problem. Since it is not used, it does not affect the correctness of the solution.

Given the corrected understanding of `func_2` and `func_3`, the overall solution is correct. The functions correctly identify unique subarray sums and reconstruct the palindrome array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate due to the misinterpretation of the logic in `func_2` and `func_3`.

### Final:
**True**

The given program is correct.
