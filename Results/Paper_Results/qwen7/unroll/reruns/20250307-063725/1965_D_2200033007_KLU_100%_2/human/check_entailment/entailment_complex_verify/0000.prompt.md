You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue.

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  3
  1 2 3 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1 2 1
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  - `func_1` generates all subarray sums and sorts them.
  - `func_2` removes duplicate sums.
  - `func_3` attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array.
  - However, the logic in `func_3` does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the palindrome array. Specifically, it does not ensure that the middle element (if `n` is odd) is correctly placed and that the array remains a palindrome.

### Issue:
- In `func_3`, the logic for assigning values to the array indices does not correctly handle the palindrome property. For instance, when `idx` is the middle index, the value assignment does not ensure that the array remains symmetric.

### Detailed Explanation:
- Consider the example with `n = 3` and subarray sums `1, 2, 3, 4, 1`.
  - After sorting and removing duplicates, the list of unique sums is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
  - When reconstructing the array, the middle element (when `n` is odd) is not correctly handled. The current implementation might assign values without ensuring the symmetry required for a palindrome.

To fix this, a more detailed approach is needed to ensure that the array remains a palindrome during reconstruction. The current implementation does not guarantee this property.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly recover a palindrome array in all cases.
