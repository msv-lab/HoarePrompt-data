Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `odds`, which is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, and a parameter `n`, which is an odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000. The function returns a list `a` consisting of `n` zeros, where the middle element is the last element from the empty `odds` list and all other elements are zero.**
