### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function generates all subarray sums of an array `a` and returns them sorted.
   - Given the problem constraints, it correctly generates all subarray sums.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to identify unique subarray sums by removing duplicates.
   - However, the logic in this function is flawed. It checks if the current subarray sum `ct` matches the last element in the `odds` list and removes the last element if they match. This approach will not correctly identify unique subarray sums because it only removes consecutive duplicates, not all duplicates.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function attempts to reconstruct the original palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums.
   - It initializes an array `a` of zeros and tries to fill it based on the unique subarray sums.
   - The logic for filling the array is flawed. It assumes that the middle element can be directly derived from the unique subarray sums, which is not always true. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the array length is odd properly.

4. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function is not used in the provided solution and seems to be a helper function for some other purpose, but it is not relevant to the main logic of solving the problem.

Given the flaws in `func_2` and `func_3`, the overall solution is incorrect. The functions do not correctly identify unique subarray sums or reconstruct the palindrome array.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in identifying unique subarray sums and reconstructing the palindrome array.
