Output State: **The program returns the last element of bigList**

Given that `bigList` contains all subarray sums except the last one, the `-1` index refers to the last element of `bigList`. Since `bigList` does not contain its own last subarray sum, the element at `-1` is the only element left in `bigList`. Therefore, the program returns this element.
