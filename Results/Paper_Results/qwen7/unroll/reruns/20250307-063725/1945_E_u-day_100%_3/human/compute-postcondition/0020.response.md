Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the length of a permutation, an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation. It then finds the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k`. If `arr[low] == k`, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints 1 followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, where `pos` is the index of `k` in `arr` if it exists, or -1 if it does not. The function returns nothing.**
