### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the position of the element `x` in the permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps. If `x` is already in the correct position, no swaps are needed. Otherwise, we need to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p[l]` equals `x`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The given code attempts to implement a binary search to find the position of `x` in the permutation `p`. However, the binary search logic is flawed because it does not correctly handle the scenario where `x` is not present in the permutation.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The code only prints the number of swaps and the indices involved. It does not actually perform the swaps. This means that even though the output might look correct, the program does not modify the permutation `p` as required.

4. **Output Analysis**:
   - **Case 1 (`n 3` and `p = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`)**: Since `x = 3` is already in the correct position, the output is `0`, which is correct.
   - **Case 2 (`n 5` and `p = [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`)**: The output is `1` with the indices `3 4`, which suggests a swap between positions 3 and 4. After the swap, `p` becomes `[3, 1, 5, 6, 2, 4]`, and `x = 5` is now in the correct position. This is correct.
   - **Case 3 (`n 5` and `p = [3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`)**: The output is `2` with the indices `2 4` and `1 5`. After these swaps, `p` becomes `[1, 3, 4, 5, 2]`, and `x = 1` is now in the correct position. This is correct.
   - **Case 4 (`n 6` and `p = [4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]`)**: The output is `2` with the indices `4 5` and `2 4`. After these swaps, `p` becomes `[4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]`, and `x = 3` is now in the correct position. This is correct.
   - **Case 5 (`n 3` and `p = [3, 2, 1]`)**: The output is `1` with the indices `1 3`. After the swap, `p` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`, and `x = 2` is now in the correct position. This is correct.

5. **Conclusion**: The provided code does not perform the necessary swaps on the permutation `p`. Instead, it only prints the number of swaps and the indices involved. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.
