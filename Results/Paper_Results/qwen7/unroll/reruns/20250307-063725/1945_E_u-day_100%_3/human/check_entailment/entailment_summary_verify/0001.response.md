### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search. We can perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found at position `l` after the binary search.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: Let's analyze the provided code:
   - The function `func_3` takes three inputs: `n`, `k`, and `arr`. It aims to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k`.
   - The binary search loop condition is `while low + 1 < high`, which is correct.
   - The `pos` variable is not used correctly; it should be used to store the index of `x` in the permutation.
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is already at the correct position (`l`).
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not in the permutation at all.
   - The function does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.
   - The function does not follow the specified output format.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The problem states that we can perform up to 2 swaps. The provided code does not explicitly handle these swaps. Instead, it directly prints the index of the element to be swapped without performing the actual swap.

4. **Output Format**: The output format requires printing the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The provided code does not produce the correct output format.

However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the function does not perform the necessary swaps and does not follow the specified output format. Upon closer inspection, the function `func_3` does attempt to find the correct position for `x` using binary search. The issue lies in the fact that the function does not perform the swaps and does not follow the output format correctly.

To correct this, we need to modify the function to:
- Perform the necessary swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.
- Follow the specified output format.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n)
    st = set()
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        # Find the first element that is greater than k
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] > k:
                print(i + 1, pos + 1)
                break
        else:
            # If no such element is found, find the last element that is less than or equal to k
            for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
                if arr[i] <= k:
                    print(i + 1, pos + 1)
                    break
```

This corrected function performs the necessary swaps and follows the specified output format. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the function does attempt to find the correct position for `x` using binary search, but it fails to perform the swaps and follow the output format correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swaps and does not follow the specified output format. However, with the provided corrections, the program can be made correct.
