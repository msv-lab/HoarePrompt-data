### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search. We can perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found at position `l` after the binary search.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The given code attempts to implement a binary search, but it has several issues:
   - The binary search loop condition should be `while low < high:` instead of `while low + 1 < high`.
   - The `pos` variable is not used correctly; it should be used to store the index of `x` in the permutation.
   - The function `func_3` does not handle the case where `x` is already at the correct position (`l`).
   - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not in the permutation at all.
   - The function does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The problem states that we can perform up to 2 swaps. The code does not explicitly handle these swaps. Instead, it directly prints the index of the element to be swapped without performing the actual swap.

4. **Output Format**: The output format requires printing the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The given code does not produce the correct output format.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the required functionality. It does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` is at the correct position and does not follow the specified output format.

### Correctness:
