### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search. We can perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found at position `l` after the binary search.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The given code attempts to implement a binary search but has several issues:
     - The binary search loop condition should be `while low < high:` instead of `while low + 1 < high`.
     - The `pos` variable is not used correctly; it should be used to store the index of `x` in the permutation.
     - The function `func_3` does not handle the case where `x` is already at the correct position (`l`).
     - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not in the permutation at all.
     - The function does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The problem states that we can perform up to 2 swaps. The code does not explicitly handle these swaps. Instead, it directly prints the index of the element to be swapped without performing the actual swap.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format requires printing the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The given code does not produce the correct output format.

### Detailed Analysis with Annotated Code:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - This function reads two integers from user input and returns them as a map object.
  - The state before calling `func_1()` is `t` (number of test cases) and `n` (length of permutation) and `x` (number to find).

- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - This function converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
  - The state before calling `func_2()` is the same as above.

- **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
  - This function reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()`.
  - It then reads the permutation `arr` using `func_2()`.
  - It searches for the index of `k` in `arr` and stores it in `pos`.
  - The binary search logic is implemented incorrectly:
    - The loop condition should be `while low < high:`.
    - The `pos` variable is not used correctly; it should be used to store the index of `x` in the permutation.
    - The function does not handle the case where `x` is already at the correct position (`l`).
    - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not in the permutation at all.
    - The function does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position.
  - The output format is incorrect because it directly prints the index of the element to be swapped without performing the actual swap.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identified several issues in the implementation:
  - Incorrect binary search loop condition.
  - Incorrect handling of the `pos` variable.
  - Lack of swap logic.
  - Incorrect output format.

Given the issues identified, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. It does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` is at the correct position and does not follow the specified output format.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to perform the necessary swaps and does not follow the specified output format.
