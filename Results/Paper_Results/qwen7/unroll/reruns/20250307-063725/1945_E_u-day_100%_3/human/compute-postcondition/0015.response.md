Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[mid] <= k`
- `high` is `low + 1`
- `st` contains all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop
- `pos` is -1

The print statement simply outputs the number 1. Since no other variables or objects are being referenced in this print statement, the only thing being printed is the integer 1.

Output: **1**
