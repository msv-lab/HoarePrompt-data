### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. Given a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) and a number \( x \).
2. Perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that after the binary search, \( p_l \) (the element at the leftmost position) is equal to \( x \).
3. Use binary search to find the position of \( x \) in the modified array.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function reads two integers from the input and returns them as a map object. However, the function `map` is not used correctly here since it returns an iterator. We should convert it to a list or tuple.
2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list. However, the function `func_1()` should return a tuple instead of a map object.
3. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - Reads \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - Finds the position of \( k \) in the array \( arr \).
   - Performs a binary search to find the largest index \( m \) such that \( arr[m] \leq k \).
   - If \( arr[low] == k \), it prints 0, indicating no swaps are needed.
   - Otherwise, it prints 1 and the positions \( low + 1 \) and \( pos + 1 \), which are not necessarily the correct positions for swaps.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The functions `func_1()` and `func_2()` do not handle the input correctly. They should read the entire test case and split it into \( n \), \( k \), and the permutation array.
2. **Binary Search Logic**: The binary search logic does not ensure that the array is rearranged to place \( x \) at the start. It only finds the largest index \( m \) such that \( arr[m] \leq k \), but it does not check if swapping is necessary.
3. **Swapping Logic**: The program does not provide a mechanism to perform the necessary swaps to ensure \( p_l = x \).

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Read Input**: Read the entire test case, including \( n \), \( k \), and the permutation array.
2. **Find Position of \( k \)**: Find the position of \( k \) in the array.
3. **Check if Swaps are Needed**: Check if \( k \) is already at the start of the array. If not, find the positions of the smallest and largest elements that are less than or greater than \( k \) and perform the necessary swaps.
4. **Perform Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the position of \( k \) in the modified array.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. It does not handle the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that \( p_l \) is equal to \( x \) after the binary search. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
