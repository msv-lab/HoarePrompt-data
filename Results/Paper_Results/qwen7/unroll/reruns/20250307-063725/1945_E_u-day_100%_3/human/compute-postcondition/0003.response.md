Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation.
   - `i` is the loop variable that will be initialized to 0 and incremented by 1 in each iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and will be incremented in each iteration, the initial value of `i` should be 0.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n`, so `n` must be at least 1 (since `n` is a positive integer).

5. **Consider the other given variables**:
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\). This information is not directly relevant to the loop execution but might be useful for understanding the context.
   - `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`. This array is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.
   - `pos` is -1. This variable is not part of the loop head and thus does not need to be adjusted.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
