Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is the largest index such that `arr[mid] <= k`.
- `high` is `low + 1`.
- `st` contains all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop.
- `pos` is -1.

When the `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` statement is executed, it will print two values:

1. `low + 1`: Since `low` is the largest index such that `arr[mid] <= k`, adding 1 to `low` gives us the next index after the last index where `arr[mid] <= k`.
2. `pos + 1`: Given that `pos` is -1, adding 1 to `-1` results in `0`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **low + 1, 0**
