Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The `while` loop condition is:
```python
while low + 1 < high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.

Given the initial state:
- `low` is 0
- `high` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`
- `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists
- `st` is an empty set

We need to determine if the condition `low + 1 < high` is satisfied based on the given values of `low` and `high`.

1. `low` is initially 0.
2. `high` is initially `n`.

The condition `low + 1 < high` translates to:
\[ 0 + 1 < n \]
\[ 1 < n \]

Since `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `n` must be at least 1. Therefore, `1 < n` is always true for any valid `n > 1`.

However, if `n` is exactly 1 (which is the smallest possible value for `n`), then `1 < 1` would be false, and the loop would not execute the first time.

To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 1.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

**State:**
**`low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1**
