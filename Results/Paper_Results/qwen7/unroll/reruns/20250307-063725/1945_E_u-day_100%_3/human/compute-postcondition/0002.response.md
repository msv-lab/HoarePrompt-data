Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and `pos` is -1.**

The code simply assigns the value `-1` to the variable `pos`. Since `n`, `k`, and `arr` were part of the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their values remain unchanged. The only change is that `pos` is now explicitly set to `-1`.
