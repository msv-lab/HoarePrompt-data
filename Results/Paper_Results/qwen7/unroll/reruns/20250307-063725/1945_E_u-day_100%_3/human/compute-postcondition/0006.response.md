Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, with the values 0 and `n`, respectively. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged from their initial state.
