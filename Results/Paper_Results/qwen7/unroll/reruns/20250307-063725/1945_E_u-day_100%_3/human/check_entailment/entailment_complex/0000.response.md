Reasoning:
- The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps to make the binary search find the target value \( x \).
- Function `func_1()` correctly reads the integer values for \( t \) and the permutation details.
- Function `func_2()` should process the permutation list `p` and return it, but the current implementation is incorrect because it calls `func_1()` without parameters, which is not defined in the context.
- Function `func_3()` attempts to find the position of \( x \) in the permutation and perform the necessary swaps. However, the logic in `func_3()` does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the binary search implementation is incorrect and does not ensure that the permutation is rearranged correctly to make the binary search find \( x \).

Given the current implementations, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
