Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program attempts to find the position of `k` in the array using binary search, but it does not handle the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps to make the array such that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

The program will attempt to find the position of `3` in the array. However, it does not consider the possibility of performing swaps to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after the binary search. Instead, it directly performs a binary search without ensuring the necessary swaps.

To fix this, the program should first check if `x` is already in the array and its position. If not, it should find the positions of the smallest and largest elements that are less than or greater than `x`, respectively, and perform the necessary swaps to place `x` at the start of the array.

Since the provided program does not handle this requirement, it is incorrect.
