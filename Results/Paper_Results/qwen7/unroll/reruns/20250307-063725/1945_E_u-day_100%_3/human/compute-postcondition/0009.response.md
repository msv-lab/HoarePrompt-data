Output State: **The variable `low` will be equal to the largest index `mid` such that `arr[mid] <= k`, `high` will be `low + 1`, `st` will contain all the indices `mid` that were added during the loop, and `pos` will be either the value of `low` if `arr[low] == k`, or -1 if no such index exists.**

Explanation: The loop continues to narrow down the range `[low, high)` until `low + 1` equals `high`. During each iteration, it checks the middle element `arr[mid]` and adjusts the `low` or `high` boundary based on whether `arr[mid]` is greater than or less than `k`. The variable `st` collects all the indices `mid` that were checked. After the loop ends, `low` points to the largest index where `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, and `high` is `low + 1`. If `arr[low]` equals `k`, then `pos` is set to `low`; otherwise, `pos` remains -1 indicating that no such index was found.
