### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find a specific number `x` in a permutation `p` using a modified binary search. We can perform at most 2 swaps to ensure that the element `x` is found at position `l` after the binary search.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The given code uses a binary search approach but has some issues:
     - The binary search loop condition is correct: `while low + 1 < high`.
     - The `pos` variable is used to store the index of `x` in the permutation.
     - The function `func_3` correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation.
     - The function does not handle the case where `x` is already at the correct position (`l`), but this is not a requirement as per the problem statement.
     - The function does not handle the case where `x` is not in the permutation at all, but this is also not a requirement as per the problem statement.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The problem states that we can perform up to 2 swaps. The given code does not explicitly handle these swaps. Instead, it directly prints the index of the element to be swapped without performing the actual swap.
   - The code does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure `x` is at the correct position, which is a critical part of the problem.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format requires printing the number of swaps and the indices of the elements to be swapped. The given code does not produce the correct output format.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - This function reads two space-separated integers from user input and returns a map object. This is not used in the main logic of `func_3`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - This function converts the map object returned by `func_1` into a list. This is not used in the main logic of `func_3`.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - The function correctly reads the length of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
  - It iterates through the permutation to find the index `pos` of `k`.
  - It performs a binary search to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k`.
  - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
  - If `arr[low] != k`, it prints `1` and the indices `low + 1` and `pos + 1` indicating the indices to be swapped.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not correctly implement the required functionality. It does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` is at the correct position and does not follow the specified output format. The code only prints the indices of the elements to be swapped without actually performing the swaps.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary swaps to ensure that `x` is at the correct position and does not follow the specified output format.
