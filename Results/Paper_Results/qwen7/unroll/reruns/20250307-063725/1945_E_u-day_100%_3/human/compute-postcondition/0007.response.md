Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, and `pos` is either the index `i` where `arr[i] == k` or -1 if no such index exists; `st` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of the other variables mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `st` which is an empty set, while all other variables retain their initial states.
