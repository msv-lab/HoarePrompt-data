Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the binary search is applied to a sorted version of the permutation, nor does it swap elements to achieve the desired result before performing the binary search. Instead, it tries to find the position of `x` directly in the original permutation without rearranging the array. This approach will not work as intended because the binary search requires a sorted array, and the problem specifies that swaps can be made to achieve the necessary order.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
1. Identify the positions of `x` and the smallest and largest elements.
2. Swap these elements into positions where they can help achieve the correct order for the binary search.
3. Perform the binary search on the rearranged array.

The given code does not include these steps, hence it is incorrect for the problem statement.
