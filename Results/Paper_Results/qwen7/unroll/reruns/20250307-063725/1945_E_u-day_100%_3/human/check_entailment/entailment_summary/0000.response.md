Reasoning:
1. Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.
2. The problem requires us to find a way to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the modified permutation will return the position of `x`.
3. The provided code has three functions:
   - `func_1`: Reads two integers from input, which are the number of test cases `t` and the length of the permutation `n`.
   - `func_2`: Converts the output of `func_1` into a list, which should contain the permutation `p` and the target value `x`.
   - `func_3`: This function is supposed to solve the main problem by finding the correct swaps to make the binary search work correctly.

Let's check the correctness of `func_3`:
- The function `func_3` takes `n` and `k` as input, which are the length of the permutation and the target value, respectively.
- It then calls `func_1` and `func_2` to get the permutation and other necessary values.
- It finds the position `pos` of `k` in the permutation.
- It performs a binary search-like process to find the largest index `low` such that `arr[low] <= k`.
- If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
- Otherwise, it prints `1` followed by the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`, indicating the required swaps.

However, the problem statement specifies that we need to perform at most 2 swaps, but the current implementation only handles the case where exactly 1 swap is needed. We need to ensure that the function can handle the case where 2 swaps might be necessary.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the examples provided in the problem statement:
1. For the input:
   ```
   6 3
   1 2 3 4 5 6
   ```
   The output should be `0` since no swaps are needed.

2. For the input:
   ```
   6 5
   3 1 6 5 2 4
   ```
   The output should be `1` and the swap positions should be `3 4` because swapping `6` and `5` makes the binary search work correctly.

3. For the input:
   ```
   5 1
   3 5 4 2 1
   ```
   The output should be `2` and the swap positions should be `2 4` and `1 5`.

Given the provided execution summary, the function `func_3` seems to handle the cases where 1 swap is needed correctly. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where 2 swaps are needed. To fully address the problem, the function should be modified to handle the case where 2 swaps are necessary.

Since the provided code does not fully implement the solution as per the problem statement, the current implementation is incomplete.

Correctness: **False**
