Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n.
2. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
3. The provided code consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function is responsible for generating a permutation for a single test case.
   - `func_2`: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1`.

4. Let's analyze `func_1`:
   - It reads `n` and `k` from the input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - It sets each element at index `i` (where `i % k == j` for `j` in range(`k`)) to `1 + (i // k) * (n // k)`.
   - This approach ensures that elements at positions differing by multiples of `k` have the same value, which helps in maintaining the k-level property.

5. Let's verify if this approach meets the k-level condition:
   - Consider the sums of continuous segments of length `k`:
     - If `k` is even, the values at positions differing by `k` will be the same.
     - Therefore, the sums of any two segments of length `k` will differ by at most 1 because they will either be identical or differ by the value of one element.
   - This construction guarantees that the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will differ by at most 1, satisfying the k-level condition.

6. Now, let's consider `func_2`:
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1`.
   - After processing all test cases, it sets `t` to 0.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the required functionality according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
