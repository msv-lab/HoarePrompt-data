Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used as the iterator in the `range(k)` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 0 because `range(k)` generates numbers from 0 to `k-1`.

3. **Determine the required state of `k`**: Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop runs until `i < k`, `k` must be at least 1. However, the problem already states that `2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5`, so `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1. Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `k`.

4. **Other variables**: The other variables (`idx`, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx_v`, `curr_v`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Based on this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i` to ensure the loop can start executing.

**State:**
**`i` is 0, `k` is an integer input from the user such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5**
