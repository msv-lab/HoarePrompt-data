Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input. It then constructs a permutation where elements at indices \( i \) (such that \( i \% k == j \) for \( j \) in range(k)) are set to a specific value. However, the current implementation sets all elements to the same value, which does not satisfy the k-level condition since the sums of any continuous segment of length \( k \) will be identical, leading to a difference of 0, which trivially satisfies the condition. But this does not cover the requirement of using all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - **func_2()**: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then iteratively calls `func_1()` for each test case. The state transitions and logic seem correct for handling multiple test cases.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The core issue lies in `func_1()`. The current implementation does not generate a permutation that meets the k-level condition with distinct values from 1 to \( n \). To meet the k-level condition, we need to ensure that the sums of any continuous segment of length \( k \) differ by at most 1. The current approach fails to achieve this because it assigns the same value to all positions that share the same modulo \( k \) index, which does not use all numbers from 1 to \( n \) and hence cannot satisfy the k-level condition properly.
   - Given the problem constraints and the need to generate a valid k-level permutation, the current implementation is insufficient and incorrect.

Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not generate a valid k-level permutation as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
