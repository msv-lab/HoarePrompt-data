Output State: `idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every element at index `i` (where `i % k == j` for `j` in range(k)) is set to `1 + (i // k) * (n // k)`, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `1 + (n * (n - 1)) // (2 * k)`.
