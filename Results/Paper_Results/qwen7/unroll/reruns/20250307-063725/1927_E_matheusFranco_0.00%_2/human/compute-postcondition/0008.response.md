Output State: **`idx` is 1, `n` is an integer input from the user, `k` is an integer input from the user, `permutation` is a list of length `n` where every element at index `i` (where `i % k == j` for `j` in range(k)) is set to `1 + (i // k) * (n // k)`, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `1 + (n * (n - 1)) // (2 * k)`, `result` is a string containing space-separated integers from the `permutation` list.**

Explanation: The code `result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])` creates a new string `result` by joining the elements of the `permutation` list into a single string, with each element converted to a string and separated by a space. This operation does not change the values of `idx`, `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `idx_v`, or `curr_v`. Therefore, these variables retain their original values, and only `result` is updated to reflect the joined string of the `permutation` list.
