Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.
2. The provided program has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
4. `func_1` reads n and k from the input, initializes a permutation list of length n with zeros, and then fills it according to a specific pattern. However, the pattern used in `func_1` does not ensure that the resulting permutation is k-level.
5. Specifically, the current implementation sets every k-th element in the permutation to a value that is incremented linearly, which does not guarantee that the sums of any continuous segments of length k will have a difference of at most 1.
6. To meet the k-level condition, we need to distribute values more evenly across the permutation.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to generate a k-level permutation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
