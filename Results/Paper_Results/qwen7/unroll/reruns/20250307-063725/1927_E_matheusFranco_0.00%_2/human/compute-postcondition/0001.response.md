Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.
3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is an input integer, we cannot directly change its value without additional information about its initial state. However, we know that for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
