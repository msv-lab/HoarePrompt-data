Reasoning:
1. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`.
3. `func_1` constructs a permutation of length `n` based on the given `k`. The logic in `func_1` aims to create a permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.
4. The approach taken in `func_1` is to initialize a list of zeros of length `n` and then fill it according to a specific pattern. The pattern involves placing values in positions that are multiples of `k` plus an offset `i`, starting from `1` and incrementing by `1` for each value placed.
5. Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the permutation `[2, 1]` is generated, which satisfies the condition since the sum of the segment is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the permutation `[1, 3, 2]` is generated. The sums of segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, which do not satisfy the condition (`\max(4, 5) - \min(4, 5) = 1`).
   - For larger `n` and `k`, the pattern might not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Given the analysis, the provided solution does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be k-level for all possible values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.

Correctness: **False**
