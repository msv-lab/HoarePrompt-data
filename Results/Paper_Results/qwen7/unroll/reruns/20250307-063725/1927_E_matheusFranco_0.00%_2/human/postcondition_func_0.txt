The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from the user, where `2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5`, `k` is even, and `n - k + 1 ≥ 1`. It then constructs a list `permutation` of length `n` where each element at index `i` (such that `i % k == j` for `j` in range(`k`)) is set to `1 + (i // k) * (n // k)`. Finally, it prints the list as a space-separated string of integers.
