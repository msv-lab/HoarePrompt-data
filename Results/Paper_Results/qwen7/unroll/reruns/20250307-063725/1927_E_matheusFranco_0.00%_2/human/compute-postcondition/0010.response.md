Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and does not return any value.**

Given the constraints and the provided code snippet, it appears that the function `func_1` does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. The constraints provided (n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, k is even, and n - k + 1 ≥ 1) seem to be conditions that should be checked before calling the function, but they do not define the function's parameters or return value. Therefore, based on the given information, the function does not perform any action related to its parameters or return any value.
