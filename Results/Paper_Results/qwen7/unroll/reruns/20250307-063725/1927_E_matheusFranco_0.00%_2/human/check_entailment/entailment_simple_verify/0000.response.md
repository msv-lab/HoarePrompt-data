### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the annotated code to understand its behavior and verify the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Input**: Reads `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Initialization**:
   - `permutation` is initialized as a list of zeros of length `n`.
   - `idx` and `idx_v` are initialized to 0 and 1 respectively.
   - `curr_v` is initialized to 1.
3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs `k` times, setting values in the `permutation` list.
   - For each iteration `i` in the loop, starting from `i`, every `k`-th element is set to `curr_v`.
   - `curr_v` is incremented after each assignment.
   - `multiples_of_k_plus_i` is updated to the next index to be assigned the value `curr_v`.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotation suggests that the output is a sequence of numbers where each segment of length `k` results in the same value repeated `n//k` times for each `j` in `range(k)`.
- However, this annotation is misleading because the actual behavior of the code is different.

#### Example Execution:
Consider `n = 4` and `k = 2`:
- The code sets the permutation as follows:
  - For `i = 0`: `permutation[0] = 1`, `permutation[2] = 1`
  - For `i = 1`: `permutation[1] = 2`, `permutation[3] = 2`
- Result: `[1, 2, 1, 2]`

Now, let's check the sums of continuous segments of length `k`:
- `1 + 2 = 3`
- `2 + 1 = 3`
- `1 + 2 = 3`
- `2 + 2 = 4`

The maximum sum is 4 and the minimum sum is 3, so the difference is 1, which satisfies the condition for a 2-level permutation.

#### General Case:
For any `n` and `k` where `k` is even, the code ensures that each segment of length `k` has the same sum. This is because:
- Each segment of length `k` contains exactly `n//k` occurrences of the same value.
- The value of each segment is determined by the initial value `curr_v` and the increment pattern, ensuring uniformity across segments.

Thus, the code guarantees that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1, making the permutation `k`-level.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The provided code does indeed generate a `k`-level permutation for the given constraints.

**Final: True**
