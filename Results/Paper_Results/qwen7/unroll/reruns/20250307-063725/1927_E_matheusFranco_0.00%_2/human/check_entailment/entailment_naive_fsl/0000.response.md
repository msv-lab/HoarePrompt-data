Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not guarantee that the constructed permutation will be k-level. Specifically, the logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and `k = 2`. The function generates the permutation `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The sums of continuous segments of length 2 are:
- `1 + 2 = 3`
- `2 + 3 = 5`
- `3 + 4 = 7`

Here, the difference between the maximum sum (7) and the minimum sum (3) is 4, which violates the condition that the difference should be no more than 1. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for constructing a k-level permutation.
