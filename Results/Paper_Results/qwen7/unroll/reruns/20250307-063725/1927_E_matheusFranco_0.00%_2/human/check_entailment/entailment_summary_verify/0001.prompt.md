You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k` (where 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even), then calls another function `func_1()` which processes these values. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is set to 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_2` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it calls `func_1`.
3. `func_1` constructs a permutation of length `n` based on the given `k`. The logic in `func_1` aims to create a permutation where the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.
4. The approach taken in `func_1` is to initialize a list of zeros of length `n` and then fill it according to a specific pattern. The pattern involves placing values in positions that are multiples of `k` plus an offset `i`, starting from `1` and incrementing by `1` for each value placed.
5. Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`, the permutation `[2, 1]` is generated, which satisfies the condition since the sum of the segment is `2 + 1 = 3`.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the permutation `[1, 3, 2]` is generated. The sums of segments are `1 + 3 = 4` and `3 + 2 = 5`, which do not satisfy the condition (`\max(4, 5) - \min(4, 5) = 1`).
   - For larger `n` and `k`, the pattern might not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1.

Given the analysis, the provided solution does not guarantee that the generated permutation will be k-level for all possible values of `n` and `k`. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.
