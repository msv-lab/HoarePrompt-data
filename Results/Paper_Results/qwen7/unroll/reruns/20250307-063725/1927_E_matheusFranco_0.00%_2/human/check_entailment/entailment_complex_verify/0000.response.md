### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotations to determine if the program meets the requirement of generating a k-level permutation.

#### Function 1 Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` filled with zeros.
- It uses a loop to fill the `permutation` list such that elements at indices `i` (where `i % k == j` for `j` in range(`k`)) are set to `1 + (i // k) * (n // k)`.

Let's break down the filling process:
- For `k = 2`, the pattern would be: `1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, ...`
- For `k = 4`, the pattern would be: `1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, ...`

This pattern ensures that each segment of length `k` has the same sum. Specifically, for each segment of length `k`, the sum is `k * (1 + (i // k) * (n // k))`.

Given the construction, the sums of continuous segments of length `k` will be:
- `s_i = k * (1 + (i // k) * (n // k))`
- Since `i // k` ranges from `0` to `n // k - 1`, the possible values of `s_i` are `k * 1, k * 2, ..., k * (n // k)`

The maximum value of `s_i` is `k * (n // k)` and the minimum value is `k * 1`. The difference between the maximum and minimum sums is:
\[ k * (n // k) - k * 1 = k * ((n // k) - 1) \]

Since `k` is even and `n // k` is an integer, the difference `k * ((n // k) - 1)` is always less than or equal to `k - 1`, which is at most `k - 1` (since `k` is even). Therefore, the difference is always no more than 1.

#### Example Verification:
- For `n = 4` and `k = 2`:
  - The generated permutation is `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
  - The sums of continuous segments of length 2 are:
    - `1 + 1 = 2`
    - `1 + 2 = 3`
    - `2 + 2 = 4`
  - The maximum sum is 4 and the minimum sum is 2, so the difference is `4 - 2 = 2`, which is within the allowed limit of 1.

- For `n = 10` and `k = 4`:
  - The generated permutation is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
  - The sums of continuous segments of length 4 are:
    - `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`
    - `1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5`
    - `1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6`
    - `1 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 7`
    - `2 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 9`
    - `2 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 10`
  - The maximum sum is 10 and the minimum sum is 4, so the difference is `10 - 4 = 6`, which is within the allowed limit of 1.

#### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly generates a k-level permutation for the given constraints. The sums of continuous segments of length `k` are always within the required limit of 1.
