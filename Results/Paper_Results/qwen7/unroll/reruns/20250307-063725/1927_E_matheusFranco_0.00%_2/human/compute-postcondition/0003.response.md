Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even. For each test case, it does not return anything explicitly but processes the input values and may perform some operations based on these inputs.**

This means the function `func_2` is designed to handle multiple test cases (specified by `t`). For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as inputs, where `k` is guaranteed to be even and within the specified range relative to `n`. The function does not return any value directly but presumably performs some operations or checks based on these inputs.
