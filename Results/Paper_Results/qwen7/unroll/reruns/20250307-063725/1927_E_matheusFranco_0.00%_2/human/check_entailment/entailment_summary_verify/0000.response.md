### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries to evaluate its correctness.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to generate a k-level permutation of length n.
   - A k-level permutation ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_2()` processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1()`.
   - `func_1()` constructs a permutation and prints it.

3. **Analysis of `func_1()`**:
   - The function initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It uses a nested loop to fill the `permutation` list. The outer loop runs `k` times, and the inner loop increments every `k`-th index starting from the current index `i`.
   - The value at each position is incremented sequentially starting from 1.

4. **Example Execution**:
   - Consider `n = 4` and `k = 2`.
     - The function initializes `permutation = [0, 0, 0, 0]`.
     - For `i = 0`: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 0 and increments by 2, setting `permutation[0] = 1`, `permutation[2] = 2`.
     - For `i = 1`: `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts at 1 and increments by 2, setting `permutation[1] = 2`, `permutation[3] = 3`.
     - Result: `permutation = [1, 2, 2, 3]`.

5. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Sums of continuous segments of length 2:
     - `1 + 2 = 3`
     - `2 + 2 = 4`
     - `2 + 3 = 5`
   - Maximum sum: 5
   - Minimum sum: 3
   - Difference: `5 - 3 = 2` (which is greater than 1).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not ensure that the sums of continuous segments of length `k` differ by no more than 1. The example clearly shows that the generated permutation `[1, 2, 2, 3]` fails the k-level condition.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not meet the requirements for constructing a k-level permutation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
