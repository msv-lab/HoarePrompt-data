Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial conditions state that `arr` contains `n` integers (where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`) and each integer in `arr` is in the range `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`. After sorting, the list `arr` will be in ascending order, but the specific values of the elements within the list will depend on the original unsorted list. However, the constraints on the values of the elements remain the same.
