State: **`max_beauty` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. The loop starts with `i` being 1 and increments `i` until `i` is less than `n`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start as 1, and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the condition `1 < n` is true initially.
4. The value of `max_beauty` (which is 0) does not affect whether the loop can execute or not, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
