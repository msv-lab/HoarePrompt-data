Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted list. After constructing `new_arr`, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1 and returns this sum as `max_beauty`.**
