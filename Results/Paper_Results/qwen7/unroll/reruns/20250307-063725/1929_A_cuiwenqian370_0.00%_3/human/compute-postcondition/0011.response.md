Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new array `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1.**
