You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It sorts the list `arr` and then constructs a new list `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted list. After constructing `new_arr`, it calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1 and returns this sum as `max_beauty`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized when the largest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, and the smallest values are placed in the middle.

2. **Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - This approach ensures that the largest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, and the smallest values are placed in the middle, which maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - After constructing `new_arr`, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic used in the `func_1` function correctly implements this calculation.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - The input handling and output formatting are correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicate values and small arrays (e.g., two elements).
   - For example, in the second test case, the array is already sorted, and the beauty remains zero because all elements are the same.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
