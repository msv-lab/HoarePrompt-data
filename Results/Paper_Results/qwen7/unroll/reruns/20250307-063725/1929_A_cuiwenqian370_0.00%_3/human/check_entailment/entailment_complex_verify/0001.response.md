### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized when the largest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, and the smallest values are placed in the middle.

2. **Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly alternate between the smallest and largest elements. Instead, it alternates between the largest and smallest elements, which is not optimal for maximizing the beauty.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - After constructing `new_arr`, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic used in the `func_1` function correctly implements this calculation, but the construction of `new_arr` is flawed.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - The input handling and output formatting are correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicate values and small arrays (e.g., two elements).
   - For example, in the second test case, the array is already sorted, and the beauty remains zero because all elements are the same. However, this test case does not fully validate the general correctness of the algorithm.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue lies in the construction of `new_arr`, where the largest and smallest elements are alternated instead of the smallest and next smallest, and the largest and next largest.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
