Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The approach taken in the `func_1` function is to sort the array and then construct a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted list. This method ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in the new array are maximized.

Let's analyze the steps:

1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted, which places all elements in ascending order.
2. **Constructing `new_arr`**: By alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements, the function creates a new array where the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the new array would be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`.
3. **Calculating `max_beauty`**: The sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` is calculated.

This approach is correct because it leverages the fact that the maximum difference between consecutive elements is achieved when the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other alternately.

Given the constraints (2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9), the solution is efficient and within the bounds of the problem requirements.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
