### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized when the largest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, and the smallest values are placed in the middle.

2. **Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - This approach ensures that the largest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, and the smallest values are placed in the middle, which maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - After constructing `new_arr`, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - The logic used in the `func_1` function correctly implements this calculation.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - The input handling and output formatting are correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicate values and small arrays (e.g., two elements).
   - For example, in the second test case, the array is already sorted, and the beauty remains zero because all elements are the same.

However, there is a flaw in the implementation of the rearrangement step. Specifically, the current implementation alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily place the largest values at the ends and the smallest values in the middle. Instead, it places the smallest and largest values in an alternating pattern, which may not always maximize the beauty.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 4`, `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
- New array: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`
- Beauty: `|4-1| + |2-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`

The correct approach would be to place the largest value at the start, the next largest at the end, the next largest at the start, and so on. This would yield:
- New array: `[4, 1, 3, 2]`
- Beauty: `|1-4| + |3-1| + |2-3| = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`

This shows that the current implementation does not always produce the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the current implementation does not guarantee the maximum beauty. The correct approach should alternate between placing the largest and smallest remaining elements in a specific order to ensure the largest values are at the ends and the smallest values are in the middle.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
