Output State: **`left` is 0, `right` is n - 1, `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The variable `right` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The values of `left` and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `left` is still 0, `right` is now `n - 1`, and `new_arr` remains an empty list.
