Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `new_arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on its elements. Therefore, the sorted list `arr` with its original properties is preserved, and only `new_arr` is updated to be an empty list.
