Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Sorting and Rearranging**:
   - The array `arr` is sorted, which is a good start because sorting helps in easily finding the optimal arrangement.
   - The logic in `func_1` aims to maximize the beauty by alternating the largest and smallest elements. However, this approach might not always yield the maximum beauty. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the rearrangement would be `[4, 1, 3, 2]`. The beauty would be `(4-1) + (3-2) = 4`, but the optimal arrangement should be `[1, 4, 2, 3]` with a beauty of `(4-1) + (3-2) = 4`.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - After rearranging, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
   - This calculation is correct and follows the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like arrays with identical elements (e.g., `[69, 69, 69]`) correctly, resulting in a beauty of 0.
   - It also handles small arrays like `[2, 1]` correctly, resulting in a beauty of 1.

Given the above points, the core issue lies in the rearrangement logic. While the provided solution attempts to alternate the largest and smallest elements, it does not always produce the maximum beauty. A better approach would be to place the largest and smallest elements in positions that maximize the sum of absolute differences.

However, the given implementation does not seem to have a flaw in the logic that directly contradicts the problem requirements. The provided solution works for the given examples and the constraints.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The current logic in `func_1` does not guarantee the maximum beauty in all cases. A more optimal approach would involve placing the largest and smallest elements in positions that maximize the sum of absolute differences, but the provided solution does not achieve this optimally.
