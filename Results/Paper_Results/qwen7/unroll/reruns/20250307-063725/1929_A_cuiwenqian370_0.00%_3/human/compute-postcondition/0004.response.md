Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `left <= right`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is \( n - 1 \)
   - `new_arr` is an empty list

3. **Determine if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `left` is 0
   - `right` is \( n - 1 \)

5. **Analyze the condition**:
   - Since `left` is 0 and `right` is \( n - 1 \), for the condition `left <= right` to be true, \( n - 1 \) must be greater than or equal to 0.
   - This means \( n \) must be at least 1 (since \( n - 1 \geq 0 \) implies \( n \geq 1 \)).

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start executing, which means \( n \) must be at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `right` to ensure that `left <= right` holds true.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`left` is 0, `right` is \( n - 1 \) and \( n \) must be at least 1**
