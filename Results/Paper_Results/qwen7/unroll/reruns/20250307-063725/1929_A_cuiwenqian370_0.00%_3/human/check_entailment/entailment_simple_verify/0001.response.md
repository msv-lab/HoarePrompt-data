### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements. The beauty is maximized when the largest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, and the smallest values are placed in the middle.

2. **Sorting and Rearrangement**:
   - The program sorts the array `arr` and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - However, the construction of `new_arr` does not always place the largest values at the ends and the smallest values in the middle. Specifically, the loop constructs `new_arr` such that the largest value is followed by the smallest value, and this pattern continues until the middle of the array is reached.

3. **Calculation of Beauty**:
   - After constructing `new_arr`, the program calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - While the construction method aims to maximize the differences, it does not guarantee the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty. For instance, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 99]`. Sorting gives `[1, 2, 99, 100]`, and the constructed `new_arr` would be `[1, 100, 2, 99]`. The beauty calculated is `|100-1| + |2-100| + |99-2| = 99 + 99 + 97 = 295`, but the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 100, 99, 2]` giving a beauty of `|100-1| + |99-100| + |2-99| = 99 + 1 + 97 = 197`.

4. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The main part of the program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and prints the result for each.
   - The input handling and output formatting are correct according to the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicate values and small arrays (e.g., two elements).
   - However, the construction method does not handle all edge cases optimally. For example, in the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the constructed `new_arr` would be `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, resulting in a beauty of `0`, which is correct. But for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the constructed `new_arr` would be `[1, 4, 2, 3]`, resulting in a beauty of `3`, whereas the optimal arrangement `[1, 4, 3, 2]` would give a beauty of `3`.

Given the above points, the program does not always produce the maximum beauty. The sorting and rearrangement method does not guarantee the optimal arrangement for maximizing the beauty.
