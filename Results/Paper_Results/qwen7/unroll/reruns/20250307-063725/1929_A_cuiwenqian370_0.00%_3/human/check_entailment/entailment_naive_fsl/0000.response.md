Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in the `func_1` function where the array is being rearranged incorrectly. Specifically, the logic for constructing `new_arr` does not ensure that the maximum beauty is achieved. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the current implementation might produce a different result because it does not always place the smallest and largest elements in positions to maximize the beauty. A correct approach would involve sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This version correctly calculates the maximum beauty by ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
