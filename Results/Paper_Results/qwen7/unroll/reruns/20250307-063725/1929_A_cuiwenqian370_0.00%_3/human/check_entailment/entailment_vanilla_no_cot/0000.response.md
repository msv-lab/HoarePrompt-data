Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The given program attempts to solve the problem but has a flaw in the logic used to calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array after rearranging its elements.

The intended approach should be to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. The current implementation sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of differences.

Here's a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    # The maximum beauty is achieved by pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, etc.
    max_beauty = sum(abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1]) for i in range(n - 1))
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected function directly calculates the maximum beauty by pairing the smallest and largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible difference for each pair.
