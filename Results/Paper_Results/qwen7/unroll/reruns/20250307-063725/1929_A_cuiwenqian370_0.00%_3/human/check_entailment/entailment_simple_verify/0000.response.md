### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the array `arr`.
   - It initializes an empty list `new_arr` and two pointers `left` and `right`.
   - It constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements from the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

#### Key Points to Evaluate:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are at the ends of the array, which helps in maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`:**
   - The logic of appending elements from both ends of the sorted array alternately ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. This is because the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, leading to the highest possible absolute differences.

3. **Calculating Maximum Beauty:**
   - The loop iterates through `new_arr` starting from the second element and sums the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

#### Correctness of the Given Program:

- The program correctly sorts the array, which is essential for maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.
- The construction of `new_arr` by alternating between the largest and smallest elements ensures that the maximum possible differences are achieved.
- The calculation of the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` is correct.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The program does correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array by following the optimal strategy of sorting the array and then constructing `new_arr` to maximize the differences.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
