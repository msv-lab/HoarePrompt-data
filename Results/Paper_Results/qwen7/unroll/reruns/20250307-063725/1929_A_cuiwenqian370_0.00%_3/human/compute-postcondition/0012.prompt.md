You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    #State: The `new_arr` will contain elements from `arr` such that for every pair of elements, the rightmost element is followed by the leftmost element of the current subarray being considered, until the middle of the array is reached.
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `max_beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns max_beauty which is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in new_arr from index 1 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It returns `max_beauty`, which is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in a new array `new_arr` from index 1 to n-1.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns max_beauty which is the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in new_arr from index 1 to n-1.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
