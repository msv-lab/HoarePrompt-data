Output State: **The `new_arr` will contain elements from `arr` such that for every pair of elements, the rightmost element is followed by the leftmost element of the current subarray being considered, until the middle of the array is reached.**

To break it down further with an example, let's assume `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`:

- Initially, `left` is 0 and `right` is 4.
- The loop runs as follows:
  - First iteration: `left` is 0, `right` is 4. Since `left != right`, `new_arr` gets `[arr[4], arr[0]]` which is `[5, 1]`. Then `left` becomes 1 and `right` becomes 3.
  - Second iteration: `left` is 1, `right` is 3. Again, since `left != right`, `new_arr` gets `[arr[3], arr[1]]` which is `[4, 2]`. Then `left` becomes 2 and `right` becomes 2.
  - Third iteration: `left` is 2 and `right` is 2. Since `left == right`, `new_arr` gets `[arr[2]]` which is `[3]`.

So, the final `new_arr` will be `[5, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
