Reasoning:

The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). The provided solution works by sorting the array and then constructing a new array by alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in the new array are maximized because the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other, leading to the largest possible positive differences.

Let's analyze the steps in detail:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in easily picking the smallest and largest elements alternately.
2. **Constructing the New Array**: By alternating between the largest and smallest elements, the differences between consecutive elements in the new array are maximized.
3. **Calculating the Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

This approach is correct because:
- Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed next to each other, maximizing the positive differences.
- Alternating between the largest and smallest elements ensures that the differences are maximized at each step.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
