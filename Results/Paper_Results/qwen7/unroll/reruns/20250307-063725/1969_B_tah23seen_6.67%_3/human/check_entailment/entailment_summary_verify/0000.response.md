### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program and verify the function summary to confirm the assessment.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Cyclic Shifts:**
   - The program attempts to swap characters directly, which is not equivalent to performing cyclic shifts. For example, consider the string `101011`. The optimal strategy involves cyclic shifts, not direct swaps.

2. **Logic for Finding Positions and Performing Swaps:**
   - The logic inside `func_1` is designed to find positions of '0' and '1' and perform swaps, but it does not correctly simulate the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. It does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order.

3. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the input `101011`, the optimal strategy involves cyclic shifts:
     1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]`: `101011` → `011011` (cost = 3).
     2. Choose the substring `[2, 4]`: `011011` → `001111` (cost = 3).
     3. Choose the substring `[3, 5]`: `001111` → `000111` (cost = 3).
   - The total cost should be 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. However, the provided program does not correctly calculate this.

#### Function Summary Analysis:

The function summary states that the function calculates the total number of swaps needed to rearrange the string so that all '1's are on the left and all '0's are on the right. This is not the same as calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. The function summary is misleading because it suggests that the function is calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts, which is not true.

Given the issues identified and the fact that the function summary is not accurately reflecting the behavior of the function, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
