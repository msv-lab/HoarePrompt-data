Output State: The list `s` will be transformed such that all '1's are moved to the left side of the list and all '0's are moved to the right side. The variable `cost` will be the sum of the distances each '1' has been moved from its original position to its final position on the left side of the list. The variable `left` will point to the first index where '1' does not exist, and `right` will point to the first index where '0' does not exist.

In more detail, the loop processes the list `s` by swapping '1's and '0's when they are found at positions `left` and `right`, respectively. It increments `cost` by the distance each '1' is moved during these swaps. The loop continues until no more swaps can be made or `right` reaches the end of the list. After the loop completes, all '1's will be to the left of all '0's in the list `s`, and the `cost` will reflect the total distance each '1' was moved.
