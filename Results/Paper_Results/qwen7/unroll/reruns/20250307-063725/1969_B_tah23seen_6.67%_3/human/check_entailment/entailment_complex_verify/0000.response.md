### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to confirm this:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the input string `sChar` into a list of characters `s`.
   - It then uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the list and attempt to swap '1's and '0's to move them to their correct positions.
   - However, the swapping logic is flawed because it performs direct swaps without considering the optimal cyclic shifts required to minimize the cost.

2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - For the input `101011`, the optimal strategy involves performing cyclic shifts rather than direct swaps. As mentioned in the example, the correct steps are:
     1. Perform a cyclic shift on the substring `[1, 3]` (cost = 3): `101011` → `011011`.
     2. Perform a cyclic shift on the substring `[2, 4]` (cost = 3): `011011` → `001111`.
     3. Perform a cyclic shift on the substring `[3, 5]` (cost = 3): `001111` → `000111`.

   - The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, but the provided program incorrectly calculates the cost.

3. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The program's logic for finding the positions of '0' and '1' and performing swaps does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts. It simply tries to swap adjacent characters, which is not the correct approach.
   - The program does not consider the possibility of performing cyclic shifts on substrings to minimize the cost. Instead, it performs direct swaps, which can lead to higher costs.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order with the minimum cost.
