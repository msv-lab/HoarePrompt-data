Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to sort a binary string `sChar` by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and calculating the minimum total cost.
2. The function initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the string and swap elements to move '1's to the left and '0's to the right.
3. The logic inside the while loop ensures that whenever a '0' is encountered after a '1', a cyclic shift is performed to bring the '0' to the left of the '1', and the cost is incremented accordingly.
4. The while loops ensure that the pointers `left` and `right` traverse the string correctly, stopping when no more swaps can be made.
5. The final return statement provides the total cost, which is calculated correctly as per the problem statement.

Given the explanation and the code structure, the program appears to be logically sound and should work as intended based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
