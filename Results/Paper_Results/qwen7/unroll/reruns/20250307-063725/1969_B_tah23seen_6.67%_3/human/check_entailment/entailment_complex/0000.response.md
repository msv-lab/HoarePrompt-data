Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to sort a binary string `sChar` by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and calculating the total cost of these operations.
2. The logic within `func_1` iterates through the string using two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find segments of '0's between '1's.
3. When a '1' is encountered (`s[right] == '1'`), and the previous character (`s[left]`) is a '0', a cyclic shift is performed, moving the '1' to the left and updating the cost accordingly.
4. The function correctly handles the traversal of the string and ensures that all '1's are moved to the left and all '0's to the right.
5. The cost calculation is accurate, as it sums up the lengths of the segments of '0's and the positions of '1's.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality without any logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
