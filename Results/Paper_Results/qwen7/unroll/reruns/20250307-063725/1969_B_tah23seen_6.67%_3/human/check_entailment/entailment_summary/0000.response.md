Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which processes the binary string `sChar`.
2. It initializes variables `left` and `right` to traverse the string and calculates the cost of swapping substrings.
3. The logic inside `func_1` ensures that whenever a '1' is encountered after a '0', a swap is performed, and the cost is updated accordingly.
4. The while loops ensure that the algorithm correctly handles the traversal and swapping process, moving through the string until all necessary swaps are made.
5. The overall structure and logic of the function align with the problem description and the expected output.

Given the execution summary, the function correctly calculates the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order by performing cyclic shifts.

Correctness: **True**
