Output State: **`sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000; `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `sChar`, `s`, or `left`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `cost` is updated to 0.
