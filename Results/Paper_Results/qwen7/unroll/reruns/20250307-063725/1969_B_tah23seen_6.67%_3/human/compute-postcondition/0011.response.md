Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's with a length between 2 and 200000. It returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) required to rearrange the string such that all '1's are on the left and all '0's are on the right. This cost is calculated as the sum of the lengths of all segments of consecutive '0's found between '1's, plus the positions of these '1's.**
