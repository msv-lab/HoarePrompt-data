### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(sChar)` is defined to process a binary string `sChar` and calculate the minimum cost to sort it. However, there is an unnecessary conversion of the string to a list of characters. Since the string itself can be manipulated directly, this conversion is not necessary and adds unnecessary complexity.

3. **Character Conversion**:
   - Converting the string `sChar` to a list `s` of characters is unnecessary. Directly manipulating the string `sChar` would be more efficient and simpler.

4. **Initialization**:
   - The variables `left`, `cost`, and `right` are initialized correctly. This part is correct.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The loop continues until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the string.
   - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, a cyclic shift operation is performed to move the '1' to the left, and the cost is updated.
   - The indices `left` and `right` are incremented appropriately to find the next mismatch.
   - However, the logic for finding the next mismatch is flawed. The current implementation only increments `right` and `left` when they are at the boundaries of '0's and '1's, respectively. This may miss some necessary shifts and could lead to incorrect results.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (`0000`) correctly, resulting in a cost of 0. This part is correct.
   - For more complex strings, the logic may not correctly identify and perform the necessary shifts to sort the string, leading to incorrect costs.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case as required. However, due to the issues in the main logic, the output may be incorrect.

### Detailed Analysis:
- Consider the string `101011`. The correct solution involves multiple cyclic shifts:
  1. Shift `[1, 3]`: `101011` → `011011`
  2. Shift `[2, 4]`: `011011` → `001111`
  3. Shift `[3, 5]`: `001111` → `000111`
  4. Shift `[4, 6]`: `000111` → `000011`
  5. Shift `[5, 6]`: `000011` → `000001`
  Total cost: 2 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 13

- The current implementation might not capture all necessary shifts, leading to an incorrect cost.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the logic in the main loop is flawed and may not correctly compute the minimum cost. The program needs to handle all necessary cyclic shifts to ensure the string is sorted correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
