Output State: The string `s` has been rearranged such that all '1's are moved to the left side of the string and all '0's are moved to the right side. The variable `cost` represents the total number of swaps performed during the process, and it is equal to the sum of the lengths of all segments of consecutive '0's found between '1's, plus the positions of these '1's.

The `left` and `right` pointers have traversed the string, and they will eventually stop at positions where no more swaps can be made according to the given conditions. The `s` list now contains a sorted version of the original binary string with '1's on the left and '0's on the right, and the `cost` variable holds the total count of such swaps.
