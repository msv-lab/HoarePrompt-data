Output State: **The program returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) performed to rearrange the string `s` such that all '1's are on the left and all '0's are on the right. This `cost` is equal to the sum of the lengths of all segments of consecutive '0's found between '1's, plus the positions of these '1's.**

This means that the program calculates the total cost (number of swaps) needed to sort the binary string `s` with all '1's on the left and all '0's on the right, and then returns this cost.
