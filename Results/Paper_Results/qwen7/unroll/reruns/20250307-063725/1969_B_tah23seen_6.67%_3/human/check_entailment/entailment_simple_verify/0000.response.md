### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Cyclic Shifts**: The program attempts to swap characters directly within the string, which is not the correct approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts. Cyclic shifts involve moving the last segment of the string to the front, not swapping individual characters.

2. **Logic for Finding Positions**: The logic for finding the positions of '0' and '1' and performing swaps does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order. The current implementation does not consider the minimum number of cyclic shifts required to move '0's to the right and '1's to the left.

3. **Example Analysis**: Consider the input string `101011`:
   - The optimal strategy involves performing three cyclic shifts:
     1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]`: `101011` → `011011` (cost = 3).
     2. Choose the substring `[2, 4]`: `011011` → `001111` (cost = 3).
     3. Choose the substring `[3, 5]`: `001111` → `000111` (cost = 3).
   - The total cost should be 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
   - However, the provided program does not correctly calculate this cost.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The program uses a simple linear scan to find '0's and '1's and performs swaps, which does not reflect the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts.
   - It does not account for the fact that a cyclic shift can be more efficient than multiple swaps of individual characters.

Given these points, the original assessment is correct. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the problem correctly, as demonstrated by the example input `101011`, where the expected cost is 9 but the program does not compute this correctly.
