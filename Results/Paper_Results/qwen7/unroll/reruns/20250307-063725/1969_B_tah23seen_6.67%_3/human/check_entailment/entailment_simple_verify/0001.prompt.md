You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)

    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1

    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000; `s` is a list containing all characters of `sChar`.

    cost = 0

    #State: Output State: The string `s` has been rearranged such that all '1's are moved to the left side of the string and all '0's are moved to the right side. The variable `cost` represents the total number of swaps performed during the process, and it is equal to the sum of the lengths of all segments of consecutive '0's found between '1's, plus the positions of these '1's.
    #
    #The `left` and `right` pointers have traversed the string, and they will eventually stop at positions where no more swaps can be made according to the given conditions. The `s` list now contains a sorted version of the original binary string with '1's on the left and '0's on the right, and the `cost` variable holds the total count of such swaps.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) performed to rearrange the string `s` such that all '1's are on the left and all '0's are on the right. This `cost` is equal to the sum of the lengths of all segments of consecutive '0's found between '1's, plus the positions of these '1's.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(sChar)` is defined to process a binary string `sChar` and calculate the minimum cost to sort it.
3. **Character Conversion**: The string `sChar` is converted to a list `s` of characters, which is unnecessary since the string itself can be manipulated directly.
4. **Initialization**: The variables `left`, `cost`, and `right` are initialized correctly.
5. **Main Logic**:
   - The loop continues until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the string.
   - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, a cyclic shift operation is performed to move the '1' to the left, and the cost is updated.
   - The indices `left` and `right` are incremented appropriately to find the next mismatch.
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (`0000`) correctly, resulting in a cost of 0.
   - For more complex strings, the logic correctly identifies and performs the necessary shifts to sort the string, calculating the total cost accurately.
7. **Output**: The program prints the cost for each test case as required.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
