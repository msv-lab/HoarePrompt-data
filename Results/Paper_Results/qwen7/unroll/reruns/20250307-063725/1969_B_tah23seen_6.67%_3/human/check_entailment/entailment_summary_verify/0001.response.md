### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1(sChar)` is intended to process a binary string `sChar` and calculate the minimum cost to sort it. However, the implementation does not correctly achieve this goal. The function summary suggests that the function should calculate the minimum cost by identifying segments of consecutive '0's between '1's and summing their lengths plus the positions of these '1's. However, the actual implementation does not follow this logic.

3. **Character Conversion**:
   - Converting the string to a list of characters (`s = []` and `for i in sChar: s.append(i)`) is unnecessary since the string can be manipulated directly. This step is redundant and could be removed without affecting the functionality.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in `func_1(sChar)` attempts to find and swap '1's and '0's to sort the string. However, the approach used is incorrect. The function does not correctly identify segments of consecutive '0's between '1's and sum their lengths plus the positions of these '1's. Instead, it tries to swap '1's and '0's directly, which does not guarantee the minimum cost.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (`0000`) correctly, resulting in a cost of 0. This is a valid edge case, but it does not guarantee that the overall logic is correct for all cases.
   - For more complex strings, the logic does not correctly identify and perform the necessary shifts to sort the string. The function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost as described in the function summary.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case as required. However, due to the incorrect logic in `func_1(sChar)`, the output may not be accurate for all test cases.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_1(sChar)` does not follow the logic specified in the function summary and does not calculate the minimum cost accurately.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
