The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) needed to rearrange the string so that all '1's are on the left and all '0's are on the right. This `cost` is calculated as the sum of the lengths of all segments of consecutive '0's found between '1's, plus the positions of these '1's.
