### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(sChar)` is defined to process a binary string `sChar` and calculate the minimum cost to sort it.
3. **Character Conversion**: The string `sChar` is converted to a list `s` of characters, which is unnecessary since the string itself can be manipulated directly.
4. **Initialization**: The variables `left`, `cost`, and `right` are initialized correctly.
5. **Main Logic**:
   - The loop continues until `left` is less than or equal to `right` and `right` is within the bounds of the string.
   - If a '0' is found at `right` and a '1' is found at `left`, a cyclic shift operation is performed to move the '1' to the left, and the cost is updated.
   - The indices `left` and `right` are incremented appropriately to find the next mismatch.
6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the string is already sorted (`0000`) correctly, resulting in a cost of 0.
   - For more complex strings, the logic correctly identifies and performs the necessary shifts to sort the string, calculating the total cost accurately.
7. **Output**: The program prints the cost for each test case as required.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.
