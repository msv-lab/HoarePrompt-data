Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1` function does not handle all possible cases correctly.

Consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, one of the optimal strategies is:

1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]`: `101011` → `011011` (cost = 3).
2. Choose the substring `[2, 4]`: `011011` → `001111` (cost = 3).
3. Choose the substring `[3, 5]`: `001111` → `000111` (cost = 3).

The total cost should be 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. However, the provided program incorrectly calculates the cost and does not handle this case properly.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of why the program fails:

1. The program attempts to swap characters directly, which is not the correct approach for calculating the minimum cost of cyclic shifts.
2. The logic for finding the positions of '0' and '1' and performing swaps does not account for the optimal way to perform cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted order.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
