Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in sChar:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `sChar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000.
   - `s` is an empty list.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each character in `sChar`. For the loop to execute, `sChar` must contain at least one character (since the loop iterates over each character).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `sChar`, `sChar` must be a non-empty string.
   - The variable `i` will take the value of each character in `sChar` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `sChar` to ensure it is a non-empty string, and `i` will be set to the first character of `sChar` before the loop starts.

**Final State**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character in `sChar`**
