Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num`, which is assigned from the `numbers` list in each iteration.

2. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: Since the loop starts iterating over the `numbers` list, the first value of `num` will be the first element in the `numbers` list.

3. **Initial state of `numbers`**: The `numbers` list is given as a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order. This means the first element (`numbers[0]`) is the largest number in the list.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means setting `num` to the first element of the `numbers` list.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` remain 0 because they are not involved in the loop head.
- `n` remains as an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000.
- `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain as integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`.
- `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.
- `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` remain empty lists.

The only state that changes for the loop to execute is `num`, which should be set to the first element of the `numbers` list.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sum_a` is 0, `sum_b` is 0, `sum_c` is 0, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na` is an integer such that 1 ≤ na ≤ n-2, `nb` is an integer such that 1 ≤ nb ≤ n-2, `nc` is an integer such that 1 ≤ nc ≤ n-2 and na + nb + nc = n, `numbers` is a list of n positive integers sorted in descending order, `group_a` is an empty list, `group_b` is an empty list, `group_c` is an empty list, `num` is the first element of the `numbers` list**.
