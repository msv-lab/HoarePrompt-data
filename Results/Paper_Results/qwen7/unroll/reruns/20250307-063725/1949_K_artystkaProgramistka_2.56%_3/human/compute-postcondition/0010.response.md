Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na, nb, and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that their sum equals n), and a list of n positive integers called numbers. The function returns either 'YES' along with three groups of indices (group_a, group_b, group_c) that partition the list into three parts with equal sums, or 'NO' if such a partition does not exist.**
