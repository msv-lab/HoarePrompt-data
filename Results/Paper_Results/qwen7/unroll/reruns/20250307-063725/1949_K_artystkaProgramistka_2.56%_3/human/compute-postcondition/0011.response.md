Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, representing an integer range and three group sizes, and a list of integers named `numbers`. It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the elements into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on the specified sizes. After distribution, it checks if the sums of the elements in these three groups are equal using `func_1`. If the sums are equal, it returns `'YES'` along with the three groups; otherwise, it returns `'NO'`.**
