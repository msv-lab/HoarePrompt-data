Output State: `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively; `n` remains 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `na`, `nb`, and `nc` remain integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n-2` and `na + nb + nc = n`; `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the elements distributed according to the `distribute_number` function.
