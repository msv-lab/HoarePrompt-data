Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

This means the program returns a tuple containing the string `'YES'` and the three lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. The lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` contain elements from the `numbers` list, ensuring each element is distributed exactly once among the three groups. The sums of these groups (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c`) satisfy the condition that the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to `True`. Additionally, the variables `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `sums` retain their initial values, and `numbers` is an empty list as all its elements have been distributed.
