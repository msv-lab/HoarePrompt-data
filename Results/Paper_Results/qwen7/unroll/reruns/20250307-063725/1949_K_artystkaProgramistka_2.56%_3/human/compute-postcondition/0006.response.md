Postcondition: **Output State: `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` respectively; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing `na`, `nb`, and `nc` elements from the `numbers` list, selected such that each element in `numbers` is distributed exactly once among the three groups; `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, and `sums` (assuming `sums` is not affected by the loop) retain their initial values; `numbers` is an empty list since all elements have been distributed; the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` evaluates to True.**
