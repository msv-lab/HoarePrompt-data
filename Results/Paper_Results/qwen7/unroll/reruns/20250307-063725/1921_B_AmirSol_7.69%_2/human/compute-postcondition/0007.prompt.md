You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of boxes, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where s1[i] = '1' indicates there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and s2[i] = '1' indicates the desired presence of a cat in the i-th box.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: The output state will be that `counter` equals the number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2` according to the given rules.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2` according to the given rules.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of boxes, `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. The function returns the number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2` according to the given rules.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2` according to the given rules.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
