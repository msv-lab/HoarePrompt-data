Output State: **`counter` is 0, n is a positive integer representing the number of boxes, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where s1[i] = '1' indicates there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and s2[i] = '1' indicates the desired presence of a cat in the i-th box.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `counter` to 0. No changes are made to `n`, `s1`, or `s2`. Therefore, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for the new value of `counter`.
