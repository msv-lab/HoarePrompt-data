Output State: The value of `counter` will be the number of changes made to satisfy the conditions in `s2`, and `i` will be equal to `n`.

Explanation: The loop iterates through each box (represented by the index `i`) and checks if the current box's condition (`s1[i]`) matches the desired condition (`s2[i]`). If they don't match, it further checks if the next box also needs a change and if the current box can be changed without affecting its adjacent box. If these conditions are met, it increments the `counter` and skips to the next next box (`i += 2`). If the next box also needs a change but the current box cannot be changed without affecting its adjacent box, or if only one box needs a change, it increments the `counter` and moves to the next box (`i += 1`). If the current box already matches the desired condition, it simply moves to the next box (`i += 1`). After all iterations, `i` will be equal to `n` because the loop exits when `i` reaches `n`.
