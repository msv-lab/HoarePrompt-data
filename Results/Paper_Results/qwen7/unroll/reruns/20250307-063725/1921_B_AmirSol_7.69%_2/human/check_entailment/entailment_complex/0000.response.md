Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
2. The given code defines a function `func_1` that attempts to count these operations.
3. The function iterates through the strings `s1` and `s2` to find mismatches and counts the necessary operations.
4. The logic in the function is flawed:
   - The condition `if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:` is incorrect because it checks if the next element in `s1` should not be the same as the next element in `s2` and also should not be the same as the current element in `s1`. This condition does not correctly reflect the problem constraints.
   - The function increments the counter and skips two positions when it finds a mismatch that could potentially be resolved by swapping, but this logic is overly restrictive and does not account for all possible valid swaps.
   - The function increments the counter for each mismatch without considering whether a valid swap can resolve multiple mismatches at once.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
