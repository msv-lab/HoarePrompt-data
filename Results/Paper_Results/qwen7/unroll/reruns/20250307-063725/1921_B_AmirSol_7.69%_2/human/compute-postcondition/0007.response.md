Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. Here, `n` represents the number of boxes, `s1` and `s2` are binary strings of length `n` indicating the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. The function counts and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2` by swapping adjacent elements under specific conditions. If two consecutive elements in `s1` can be swapped without violating the condition that no two adjacent elements should be the same after the swap, both elements are considered in one operation. If not, each element is treated separately.**
