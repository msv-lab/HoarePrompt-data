Reasoning:
1. The provided program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of boxes `n`, the initial state of the boxes `s1`, and the desired state of the boxes `s2`.
3. The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2`.
4. In `func_1`, the variable `counter` keeps track of the number of operations performed.
5. The loop iterates through the boxes, comparing the initial and desired states.
6. If the states differ, it checks if moving a cat from one box to another (if possible) or removing a cat can achieve the desired state with fewer operations.
7. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly account for all possible operations. Specifically, it only considers moving a cat from one box to another if the adjacent box is empty and the states are different. This is insufficient because it does not consider removing a cat or moving a cat from any box to any other box.
8. The function fails to handle cases where the desired state requires more complex operations, such as removing a cat from a box that is not adjacent to an empty box.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state.

Correctness: **False**
