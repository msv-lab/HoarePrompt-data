#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of boxes, and s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', where s1[i] = '1' indicates there is a cat in the i-th box initially, and s2[i] = '1' indicates the desired presence of a cat in the i-th box.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: The output state will be that `counter` equals the number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2` according to the given rules.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of operations required to make `s1` equal to `s2` according to the given rules.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `s1`, and `s2`. Here, `n` represents the number of boxes, `s1` and `s2` are binary strings of length `n` indicating the initial and desired states of the boxes, respectively. The function counts and returns the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2` by swapping adjacent elements under specific conditions. If two consecutive elements in `s1` can be swapped without violating the condition that no two adjacent elements should be the same after the swap, both elements are considered in one operation. If not, each element is treated separately.
