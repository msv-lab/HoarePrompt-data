### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` aims to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s1` to the desired state `s2`. The operations include:
   - Moving a cat from one box to another.
   - Removing a cat from a box.
   - Adding a cat to a box.

2. **Current Logic**: The current logic in `func_1` only considers moving a cat from one box to another if the adjacent box is empty and the states are different. This is a simplified approach but does not cover all possible operations.

3. **Issues Identified in the Original Assessment**:
   - The function does not consider removing a cat from a box that is not adjacent to an empty box.
   - The function does not account for scenarios where multiple operations are needed to achieve the desired state.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the state transitions and the logic within the function.
   - The function increments the `counter` when a difference is found between `s1` and `s2`.
   - The function checks if it can move a cat to an adjacent box without considering other possible moves.

5. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The function does not handle all possible operations, specifically missing the ability to remove a cat or move a cat to any non-adjacent box.
   - The logic is overly simplistic and does not account for the full range of operations required to achieve the desired state.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state due to its limited logic.

### Final:
**False**
