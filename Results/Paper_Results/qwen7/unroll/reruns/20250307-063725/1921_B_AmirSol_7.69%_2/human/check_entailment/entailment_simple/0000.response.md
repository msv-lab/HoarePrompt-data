Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of operations needed to transform the initial state of cats in boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`).
2. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates through the boxes and counts the necessary operations.
3. The logic in `func_1` checks if the current box state (`s1[i]`) matches the desired state (`s2[i]`). If not, it increments the counter and moves to the next box(s) accordingly.
4. The logic for moving to the next box(s) seems flawed because it assumes that if two consecutive boxes need to change their state, only one operation is needed to swap the cats between them. However, this assumption does not cover all scenarios, especially when more complex patterns of changes are involved.
5. The provided example test cases show that the function does not always produce the correct result. For instance, in the first test case, the expected output is 2, but the function outputs 1, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.

Given these points, the function does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum number of operations.

Correctness: **False**
