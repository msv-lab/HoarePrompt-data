Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the binary strings `s1` and `s2` and counting the minimum number of operations needed to transform `s1` into `s2`. However, the logic within the `func_1` function does not correctly implement the rules specified in the problem statement. Specifically, the function does not account for moving cats between non-adjacent boxes or removing cats from boxes.

Here's a breakdown of the issues:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Adjacent Swaps**: The function checks if two consecutive elements in `s1` can be swapped without violating the condition that no two adjacent elements should be the same after the swap. However, this logic is flawed because it only considers adjacent swaps and does not account for non-adjacent swaps or removals.
2. **Lack of Non-Adjacent Swap and Removal Handling**: The function does not handle cases where non-adjacent swaps or removals are necessary to achieve the desired state. For example, if a cat needs to be moved from box 1 to box 3, the current logic does not account for this operation.

Given these issues, the function will not correctly compute the minimum number of operations required to transform `s1` into `s2`.

Correctness: **False**
