The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of length `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 <= find <= n`. It performs a binary search to find the position where `find` would fit in the sorted order of `array`. If `find` is not already in `array`, it returns a list containing the indices `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`. If `find` is already in `array`, it returns a list containing the same indices but prints `0`.
