### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most two swaps to make the element `x` appear at the leftmost position (`p_l`) when performing a binary search.
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, with the loop ending when `r - l = 1`, calculating the middle index `m`, and updating `l` or `r` based on the comparison with `x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, but there is a critical flaw in how the indices are handled within the function `func_1`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `x` is not already at the leftmost position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If `x` is already at the correct position, it prints `0`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the leftmost position, no swaps are needed, and the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the leftmost position, the function incorrectly identifies the indices of the elements to be swapped to place `x` at the leftmost position.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - However, the logic for determining the indices to swap is flawed. Specifically, the indices returned by `array.index(find)` may not necessarily be the correct indices to swap to move `x` to the leftmost position.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be placed.
  - If `x` is not at the leftmost position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
  - The issue lies in the line `return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]`. Here, `array.index(find)` finds the index of `x` in the array, which might not be the correct index to swap to move `x` to the leftmost position.

- **Example**:
  - Consider the permutation `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` and `x = 3`.
  - The binary search correctly identifies that `x` should be at index `1` (since `array[1] = 3`).
  - However, `array.index(3)` returns `1`, which is already the correct position. Therefore, no swap is needed.
  - The function incorrectly prints `1` and returns `[2, 1]`, suggesting a swap between indices `2` and `1`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` incorrectly identifies the indices to swap, leading to unnecessary swaps and incorrect results in some cases. The function should correctly identify the indices to swap to move `x` to the leftmost position without unnecessary swaps.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
