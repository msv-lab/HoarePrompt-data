### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most two swaps to make the element `x` appear at the leftmost position (`p_l`) when performing a binary search.
2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, with the loop ending when `r - l = 1`, calculating the middle index `m`, and updating `l` or `r` based on the comparison with `x`.
3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `x` is not already at the leftmost position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If `x` is already at the correct position, it prints `0`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the leftmost position, no swaps are needed, and the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the leftmost position, the function correctly identifies the indices of the elements to be swapped to place `x` at the leftmost position.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - The output format matches the required format, printing the number of operations followed by the indices of the swaps.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the leftmost position before performing the binary search. The implementation handles all edge cases appropriately and follows the specified output format.

### Correctness:
**True**
