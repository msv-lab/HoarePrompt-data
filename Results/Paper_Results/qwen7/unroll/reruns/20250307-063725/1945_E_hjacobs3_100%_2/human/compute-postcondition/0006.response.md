Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` is the index such that for all `i < l`, `array[i] > find`, and for all `i > l`, `array[i] >= find`.
- `r` is `l + 1`.
- `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`.

Given this, the print statement will output the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
