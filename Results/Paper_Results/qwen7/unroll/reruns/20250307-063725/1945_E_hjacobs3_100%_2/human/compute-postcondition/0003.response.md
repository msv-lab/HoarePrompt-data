Output State: `l` is the index such that for all `i < l`, `array[i] > find`, and for all `i > l`, `array[i] >= find`. The value of `r` is `l + 1`.

Explanation: The loop is performing a binary search on the list `array` to find the position where the value `find` would fit in the sorted version of `array`. After the loop finishes, `l` will point to the first index where `array[l]` is no longer less than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be `l + 1`. This means that `array[l]` is greater than `find` and `array[r]` (which is `array[l+1]`) is either greater than or equal to `find`.
