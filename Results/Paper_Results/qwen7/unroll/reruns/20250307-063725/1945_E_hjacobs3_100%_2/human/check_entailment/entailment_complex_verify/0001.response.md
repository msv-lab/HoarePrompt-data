### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most two swaps to make the element `x` appear at the leftmost position (`p_l`) when performing a binary search.
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, with the loop ending when `r - l = 1`, calculating the middle index `m`, and updating `l` or `r` based on the comparison with `x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**:
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, but there is a critical flaw in how the indices are being used to determine the correct swap positions.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `x` is not already at the leftmost position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly identify the indices to swap. Specifically, it uses `array.index(find)` which finds the first occurrence of `x` in the array, not necessarily the correct position to swap with `l`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the leftmost position, the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the leftmost position, the function may incorrectly identify the indices to swap, leading to incorrect results.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` is flawed, leading to incorrect outputs for some test cases.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Incorrect Swapping Logic**:
  - The function `func_1` should find the correct position to swap `x` with the element at `l` to move `x` to the leftmost position.
  - The current implementation uses `array.index(find)` which may not be the correct position to swap with `l`.

- **Example Test Case**:
  - Consider the input:
    ```
    6 3
    4 3 1 5 2 6
    ```
  - The function `func_1` will find that `3` is at index 1, but it should swap `3` with `4` at index 0 to move `3` to the leftmost position.
  - The current implementation will incorrectly print `2 4` as the swap indices, which is not the correct solution.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the indices to swap. The current implementation may produce incorrect results for some test cases, even though it handles the edge case where `x` is already at the leftmost position correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
