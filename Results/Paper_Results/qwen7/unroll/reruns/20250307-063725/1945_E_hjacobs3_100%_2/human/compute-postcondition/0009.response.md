Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` is the index such that for all `i < l`, `array[i] > find`, and for all `i > l`, `array[i] >= find`.
- `r` is `l + 1`.
- `l` equals `array.index(find)`.

Given this, let's break down the variables:

1. `l` is set to the index where `find` is found in the `array`. This means `array[l] == find`.
2. `r` is defined as `l + 1`, so `r` is the index immediately following `l`.

The print statement simply outputs `0`.

Output: **0**
