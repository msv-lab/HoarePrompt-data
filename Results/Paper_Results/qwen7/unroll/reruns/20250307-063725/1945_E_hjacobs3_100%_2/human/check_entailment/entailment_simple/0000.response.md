Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most two swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the `l`-th position after a binary search.
2. The provided code attempts to find the correct position `l` using a binary search-like approach.
3. The logic inside the `func_1` function is flawed because it incorrectly initializes `l` and `r` and does not correctly perform the binary search. Specifically:
   - `l` should be initialized to 1 and `r` to `n+1` as per the problem statement.
   - The binary search loop condition should check `r - l == 1` instead of `r - l > 1`.
   - The binary search logic should update `l` and `r` based on whether `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`.
4. The function does not handle the case where the element `x` is already in the correct position (`l`).
5. The function does not ensure that the required number of swaps (at most 2) is used to place `x` at the correct position.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
