Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `r - l > 1`.
2. **Determine the current values**: Before the loop starts, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n`.
3. **Check the loop condition with current values**: 
   - `r - l = n - 0 = n`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n - 0` must be greater than 1, i.e., `n > 1`.

Since the only variables in the loop head are `l` and `r`, and the condition depends on their difference, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `r - l > 1`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect that `n` must be greater than 1.

**State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n and n must be greater than 1**
