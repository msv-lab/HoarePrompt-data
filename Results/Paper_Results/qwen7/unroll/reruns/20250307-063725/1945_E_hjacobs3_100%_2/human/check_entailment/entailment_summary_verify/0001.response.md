### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most two swaps to make the element `x` appear at the leftmost position (`p_l`) when performing a binary search.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, but there are some issues with the swapping logic and the overall approach.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to find the index of `x` in the array.
   - If `x` is not already at the leftmost position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If `x` is already at the correct position, it prints `0`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the leftmost position, no swaps are needed, and the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the leftmost position, the function correctly identifies the indices of the elements to be swapped to place `x` at the leftmost position.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters for each test case.
   - However, the function `func_1` only checks if `x` is at the leftmost position and does not consider the possibility of needing two swaps.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the position of `x` in the array.
  - If `x` is not at the leftmost position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
  - This function does not handle the case where two swaps are needed to place `x` at the leftmost position.

- **Example Test Case**:
  - Consider the test case: `6 3`
    - Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
    - Here, `x = 3` is already at the leftmost position, so no swaps are needed.
    - The function correctly prints `0`.

- **Another Example Test Case**:
  - Consider the test case: `6 5`
    - Input: `[3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4]`
    - Here, `x = 5` is not at the leftmost position.
    - The function finds that `5` is at index `3` and prints `1` and returns the indices `[3, 1]`.
    - However, to place `5` at the leftmost position, we need to swap `5` with `1` and then swap `5` with `3` (since `1` is already at the leftmost position).
    - The function should return `2` and the indices `[3, 1]` and `[3, 5]`.

### Conclusion:
The function `func_1` only handles the case where one swap is needed to place `x` at the leftmost position. It does not handle the case where two swaps are needed. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not guarantee that it will perform at most two swaps as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
