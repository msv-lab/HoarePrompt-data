Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: "l + 1" and "array.index(find) + 1"**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `l` is the index such that for all `i < l`, `array[i] > find`, and for all `i > l`, `array[i] >= find`. Also, `r` is `l + 1`, and `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in `array`. The code returns a list containing two elements: `str(l + 1)` and `str(array.index(find) + 1)`. Since `l` is the index where the condition changes from elements being greater than `find` to elements being greater than or equal to `find`, `l + 1` gives us the position right after the last element that is strictly greater than `find`. The second element, `array.index(find) + 1`, gives the position of `find` in the array, adjusted to be 1-based instead of 0-based.
