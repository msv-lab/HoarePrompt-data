Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for updating `num` does not accurately reflect the number of free rows and columns after placing the rooks. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
1
4 1
1 2
```

According to the problem description:
- You place a white rook at (1, 2).
- The computer places a black rook at (2, 1).

After this, there are 2 free rows (rows 3 and 4) and 2 free columns (columns 3 and 4). The number of ways to place rooks in these free rows and columns is calculated using dynamic programming. However, the current implementation of `num` does not correctly account for the number of free rows and columns.

The correct approach would involve maintaining a count of free rows and columns separately and then using these counts to compute the number of possible configurations. The given program incorrectly increments `num` without properly accounting for the free rows and columns.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for this specific case, making it incorrect.
