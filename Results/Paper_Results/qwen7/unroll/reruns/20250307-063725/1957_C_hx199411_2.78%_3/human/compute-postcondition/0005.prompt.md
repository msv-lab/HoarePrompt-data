You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The moves are represented as pairs (r_i, c_i) where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks attack each other either directly or through the mirrored moves made by the computer.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will depend on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify any particular input values for `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`, we can consider a general case where these values vary.
    #
    #The loop processes each value of `t` (which starts as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) until it reaches zero. For each value of `t`, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `c` and `r`. Based on these inputs, it calculates `num` and then determines `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `0`, `1`, or computes a dynamic programming solution to print a result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    #
    #Since the exact inputs are not specified, the final output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r` for each iteration. However, the process will always follow the described steps for each value of `t`.
    #
    #Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a value of `t` processed by the loop. Each line will either print `0`, `1`, or a result computed using dynamic programming based on the input values `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it accepts integers t, n, and k, along with a list of moves represented as pairs (r_i, c_i). The function checks if the given moves are valid under the condition that no two rooks attack each other either directly or through the mirrored moves made by the computer. If all conditions are met for all test cases, it returns whether the moves are valid for each case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
