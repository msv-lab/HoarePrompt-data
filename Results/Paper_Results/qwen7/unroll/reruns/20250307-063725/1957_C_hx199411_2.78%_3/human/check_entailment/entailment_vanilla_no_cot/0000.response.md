Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations for the given problem. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.

2. **Initial Setup**: For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k` already played.

3. **Counting Fixed Positions**: It counts the number of positions where the rooks are placed (`num`). If the rook is placed on the diagonal (i.e., `c == r`), it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.

4. **Calculating Remaining Free Cells**: It calculates the number of free cells left on the board (`m = n - num`).

5. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations**: If no free cells are left (`m == 0`), it prints 0. If only one free cell is left (`m == 1`), it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining cells.

6. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The DP table `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for up to `m` free cells. The base cases are set correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).

7. **DP Table Filling**: The DP table is filled using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i >= 3`.

8. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the number of possible final configurations for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
