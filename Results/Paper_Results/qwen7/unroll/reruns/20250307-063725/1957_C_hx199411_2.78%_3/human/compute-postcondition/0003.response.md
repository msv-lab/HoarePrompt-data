Output State: The output state will depend on the inputs provided within each iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify any particular input values for `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`, we can consider a general case where these values vary.

The loop processes each value of `t` (which starts as an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)) until it reaches zero. For each value of `t`, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `c` and `r`. Based on these inputs, it calculates `num` and then determines `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `0`, `1`, or computes a dynamic programming solution to print a result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Since the exact inputs are not specified, the final output state cannot be precisely determined without knowing the specific values of `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r` for each iteration. However, the process will always follow the described steps for each value of `t`.

Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a value of `t` processed by the loop. Each line will either print `0`, `1`, or a result computed using dynamic programming based on the input values `n`, `k`, `c`, and `r`.
