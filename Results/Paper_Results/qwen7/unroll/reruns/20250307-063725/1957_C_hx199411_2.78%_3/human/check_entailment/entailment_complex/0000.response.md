Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the dimensions of the board `n` and the number of moves `k` for each test case. It also reads the moves `(r_i, c_i)` for each of the `k` moves.

2. **Mirrored Moves Handling**: The program correctly identifies mirrored moves where `c == r` and counts them separately. For non-mirrored moves, it counts them as two valid moves (one for the player and one for the computer).

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions. This is done by initializing a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in `i` positions. The base cases are handled correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`). The recurrence relation used is also correct, accounting for placing a rook in one of the `i` positions and considering the remaining positions.

4. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `m == 0` or `m == 1`.

Given that the program follows the problem requirements and handles all aspects correctly, the provided program is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
