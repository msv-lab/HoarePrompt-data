Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it accepts integers t, n, and k, along with a list of moves represented as pairs (r_i, c_i). The function checks if the given moves are valid under the condition that no two rooks attack each other either directly or through the mirrored moves made by the computer. If all conditions are met for all test cases, it returns whether the moves are valid for each case.**

Note: The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the provided output cases, so the return value is implied to be a boolean indicating the validity of the moves for each test case.
