Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid after the code is executed. The other parts of the initial state (regarding `n` and `k`, and the moves represented as pairs) are not affected by this line of code.
