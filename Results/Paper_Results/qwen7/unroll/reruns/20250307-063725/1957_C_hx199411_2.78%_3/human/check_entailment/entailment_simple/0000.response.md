Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program correctly counts the number of mirrored moves (`num`). If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2. This logic ensures that the program correctly accounts for the mirrored moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations. The base cases are correctly set up, and the recurrence relation is applied correctly to compute the number of configurations for the remaining cells. The modulo operation is applied correctly to handle large numbers.

4. **Output**: The program outputs the correct number of configurations for each test case, modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the program appears to be correct and follows the specified logic for calculating the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
