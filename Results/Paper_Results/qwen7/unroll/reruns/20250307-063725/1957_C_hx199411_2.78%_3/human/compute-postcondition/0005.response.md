Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it accepts integers t, n, and k, along with a list of moves represented as pairs (r_i, c_i). It calculates the number of valid moves (where no two rooks attack each other either directly or through mirrored moves) and then determines the output based on the remaining positions. If no positions are left, it prints 0; if one position is left, it prints 1; otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute and print the number of ways to place rooks on the remaining positions modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
