Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed as the result of the dynamic programming calculations based on the values of `n` and `k` provided in each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: Each iteration of the while loop processes the values of `n` and `k`, calculates `num` based on the inputs, and then determines `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `0`, `1`, or proceeds to calculate a value using dynamic programming and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\). The final output state consists of these printed results from each iteration of the loop.
