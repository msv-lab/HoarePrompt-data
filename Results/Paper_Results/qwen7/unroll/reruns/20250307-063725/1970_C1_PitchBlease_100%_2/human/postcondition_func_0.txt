The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree using the given number of nodes `n`, edges, and a starting node `start`. It then identifies the two leaves of the tree, calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to these leaves, and determines whether either of these distances is odd. If any distance is odd, the function returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
