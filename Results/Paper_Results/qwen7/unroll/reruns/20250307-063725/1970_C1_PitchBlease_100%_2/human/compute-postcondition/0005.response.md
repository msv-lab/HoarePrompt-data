Output State: **(-1, -1)**

Natural Language Explanation: The provided code snippet returns `-1`. Since the initial state does not specify any particular values for `target` or `dist`, and the code simply returns `-1` without referencing these variables, the only logical conclusion is that both `target` and `dist` are not updated before the return statement. Therefore, the program returns a tuple where both elements are `-1`.
