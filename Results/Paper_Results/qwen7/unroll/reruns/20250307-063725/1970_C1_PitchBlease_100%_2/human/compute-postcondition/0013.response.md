The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The function returns either the string 'Ron' or the string 'Hermione'. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `edges`, and `start`, and returns 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the traversal of the tree from the starting node.**
