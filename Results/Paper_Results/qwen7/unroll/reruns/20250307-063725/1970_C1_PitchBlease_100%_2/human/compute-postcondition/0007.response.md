Functionality: **The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` (an integer representing the starting node) and `target` (an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree). It also accepts a dictionary named `tree` which represents the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns a tuple containing the `target` node and its shortest distance from the `start` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns `(-1, -1)`.**
