Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import deque, defaultdict

(n, t) = map(int, input().split())
edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
starts = list(map(int, input().split()))
start = starts[0]
print(func_1(n, edges, start))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all edges from `edges` added bidirectionally. The state of `n` and `start` remains unchanged.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree using the given number of nodes `n`, edges, and a starting node `start`. It then identifies the two leaves of the tree, calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to these leaves, and determines whether either of these distances is odd. If any distance is odd, the function returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, target is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and tree is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a tuple consisting of the node index `target` and its shortest distance from the starting node `start`.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the `current` node will be equal to the `target` node, and the `dist` variable will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. This is because the loop continues to process nodes level by level (BFS), updating the distance until it finds the `target` node, at which point it returns the distance.
    return -1
    #(-1, -1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start` (an integer representing the starting node) and `target` (an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree). It also accepts a dictionary named `tree` which represents the adjacency list of the tree. The function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is found, it returns a tuple containing the `target` node and its shortest distance from the `start` node. If the `target` node is not found, it returns `(-1, -1)`.
