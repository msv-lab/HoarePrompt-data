Output State: The output state will be a tuple consisting of the node index `target` and its shortest distance from the starting node `start`.

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the `current` node will be equal to the `target` node, and the `dist` variable will hold the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. This is because the loop continues to process nodes level by level (BFS), updating the distance until it finds the `target` node, at which point it returns the distance.
