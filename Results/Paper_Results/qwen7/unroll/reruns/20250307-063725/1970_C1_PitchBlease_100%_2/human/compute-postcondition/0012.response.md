The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.

It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`, and return either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
