Output State: The output state will be a tuple `(current, dist)` where `current` is the node that matches the `target` and `dist` is the shortest distance from the `start` node to the `target` node.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the loop will either find the `target` node and return the distance `dist` from the `start` node to the `target` node, or exhaust all possible paths without finding the `target`. If the `target` is found, the function returns the shortest path distance; otherwise, it would not return anything (or raise an error if the return statement is outside the loop).
