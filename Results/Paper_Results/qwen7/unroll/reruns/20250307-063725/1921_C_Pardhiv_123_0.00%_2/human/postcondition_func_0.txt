The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), and a list of \( n \) integers. It then calculates the minimum cost required to move from each element to the next in the list, subtracting this cost from \( f \). If \( f \) remains positive after processing all elements, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for each test case, and the final output consists of "YES" or "NO" for each test case.
