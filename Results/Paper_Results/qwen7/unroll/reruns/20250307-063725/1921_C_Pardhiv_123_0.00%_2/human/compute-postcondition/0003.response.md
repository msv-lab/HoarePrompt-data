Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the while loop, depending on whether the value of `f` is greater than 0 after executing the operations inside the loop.

To break it down further:
- For each value of `t`, the program reads four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and a list of integers (`ls`).
- It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element, calculating the minimum cost of moving from one element to the next using either `a` or `b`.
- The variable `f` is updated by subtracting the minimum cost for each step.
- If `f` is still positive after processing all elements in `ls`, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
- After printing the result for the current `t`, `t` is decremented by 1.
- This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.

The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses, one for each iteration of the while loop, based on the calculations performed within the loop.
