Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly account for the total charge consumption when turning the phone off and on. Specifically, the logic for updating the phone's charge `f` does not properly consider the cost of turning the phone off and on between messages.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Charge Consumption Calculation**: The program subtracts `min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` from `f` for each interval between messages. However, this does not accurately reflect the total charge consumed because it doesn't account for the cumulative effect of turning the phone off and on multiple times.

2. **Turning Off and On**: The program should calculate the total charge consumed by considering both the continuous usage and the repeated turning off and on. The charge lost due to continuous usage is `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`, and the charge lost due to turning off and on is `b`.

3. **Cumulative Charge Calculation**: The correct approach would be to keep track of the cumulative charge and ensure that the phone's charge is never depleted before sending a message.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the charge for the first message
        remaining_charge = f
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            # Calculate the charge needed to send the next message
            charge_needed = max(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
            
            # If the charge is sufficient, use it
            if remaining_charge >= charge_needed:
                remaining_charge -= charge_needed
            else:
                # If the charge is insufficient, we need to turn off and on
                turns_needed = (charge_needed - remaining_charge + b - 1) // (b - a)
                remaining_charge = f - turns_needed * b
                
                # Check if we still have enough charge after turning off and on
                if remaining_charge >= charge_needed:
                    remaining_charge -= charge_needed
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break
        else:
            print('YES')
        
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the phone's charge is managed correctly, including the cost of turning the phone off and on, and checks whether Stepan can send all messages without depleting the battery.
