Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the while loop, depending on whether the variable `f` remains positive after processing each set of inputs.

Explanation: For each iteration of the while loop, the program reads values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list `ls`. It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element, updating `f` based on the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`). If `f` is still greater than 0 after processing all elements in `ls`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing, `t` is decremented by 1. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0. The output state is the sequence of "YES" or "NO" printed during these iterations.
