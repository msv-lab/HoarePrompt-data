You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The list m contains n integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the while loop, depending on whether the value of `f` is greater than 0 after executing the operations inside the loop.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- For each value of `t`, the program reads four integers (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`) and a list of integers (`ls`).
    #- It then iterates through the list `ls` starting from the second element, calculating the minimum cost of moving from one element to the next using either `a` or `b`.
    #- The variable `f` is updated by subtracting the minimum cost for each step.
    #- If `f` is still positive after processing all elements in `ls`, "YES" is printed; otherwise, "NO" is printed.
    #- After printing the result for the current `t`, `t` is decremented by 1.
    #- This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.
    #
    #The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses, one for each iteration of the while loop, based on the calculations performed within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, integers n, f, a, b, and a list m of n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 with m_i < m_{i+1}). It returns different values based on the given conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
