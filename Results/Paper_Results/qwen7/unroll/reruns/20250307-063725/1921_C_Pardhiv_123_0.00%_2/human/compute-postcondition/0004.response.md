Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, integers n, f, a, b, and a list m of n integers (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 with m_i < m_{i+1}). It returns different values based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of integers and a list, and it processes these inputs according to specified conditions without needing any additional parameters beyond what is provided within the function call.
