Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the necessary parameters \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), and \( b \), and the list of message sending moments.
- The core logic of the program iterates through the list of message sending times and updates the remaining charge `f` by subtracting the minimum of two costs: the charge consumed if the phone is left on continuously (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) or the charge consumed if the phone is turned off and on (`b`).
- After processing all messages, it checks if `f` is still greater than 0. If yes, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
- The logic appears to handle the problem correctly according to the provided problem description and examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program should work as intended for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
