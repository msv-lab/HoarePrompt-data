Reasoning:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of 'pie' and 'map':**
   - The function `func_1` only checks for and removes the substring 'pie'. It does not handle the substring 'map'.
   - According to the problem statement, the string should be made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters to eliminate both 'pie' and 'map' substrings. However, the current implementation only addresses 'pie'.

2. **Logic for 'map':**
   - The problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful, which means both 'pie' and 'map' should be handled.
   - The function should iterate and remove both 'pie' and 'map' substrings until neither is present, counting the deletions.

3. **Return Value:**
   - The function currently returns 1 if 'pie' is found, and the count of 'pie' removals otherwise. This is incorrect because it does not account for 'map' and does not ensure the string is made beautiful.

Given these issues, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
