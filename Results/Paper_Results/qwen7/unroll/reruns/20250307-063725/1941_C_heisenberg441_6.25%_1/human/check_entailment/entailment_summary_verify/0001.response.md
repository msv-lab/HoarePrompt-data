### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters to remove from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s`.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` to process the string and prints the result.
   - The function `func_1(s)` checks if the string `s` is exactly "mapie" and returns 1 if true.
   - Otherwise, it uses two while loops to find and remove occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string, incrementing the count of deletions (`ans`) each time it removes a substring.

3. **Function `func_1(s)` Issues**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` incorrectly handles the removal of substrings. It only removes "map" and "pie" but does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, if the string is "mapmap", it would only remove one "map" and leave another "map" in the string, which should be removed as well.
   - The function `func_1(s)` does not account for the possibility that after removing "map" or "pie", new instances of these substrings might appear due to the removal of characters in between them.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a more robust method to ensure all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed efficiently.
   - One approach could be to iterate through the string and keep track of the indices where "map" and "pie" occur, then remove these substrings in a way that avoids reprocessing already checked parts of the string.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary states that the function returns either 1 or the count of how many times the substring 'pie' is found and removed from `s`. This is misleading because the function actually counts the removals of both "map" and "pie".
   - The function does not correctly handle overlapping substrings, as mentioned earlier.

6. **Evaluation**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` does not correctly implement the logic to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. It fails to handle overlapping substrings and does not provide the correct solution for all test cases.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identified that the given program does not handle overlapping substrings and does not provide the correct solution for all test cases.

**Final: False**
