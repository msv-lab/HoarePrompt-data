Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns either 1 or the count of how many times the substring 'pie' is found and removed from `s`. If 'pie' is not found in `s`, it returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through `s` to find and remove all occurrences of 'pie', counting each removal, and then returns the total count of such occurrences.**
