Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `s`.

2. **Understand the Condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will execute as long as the substring `'pie'` is found in the string `s`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - The variable `ans` will be the number of times the substring `'map'` appears in the string `s`.
   - The string `s` will be the original string with all occurrences of `'map'` removed.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the substring `'pie'` must be present in `s`.
   - Since `s` is the original string with all occurrences of `'map'` removed, the presence of `'pie'` in `s` does not depend on `ans` but directly on the content of `s`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `s` to ensure that `'pie'` is present in `s`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure that the substring `'pie'` is present in `s`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`ans` will be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`, and `s` must contain the substring 'pie'**.
