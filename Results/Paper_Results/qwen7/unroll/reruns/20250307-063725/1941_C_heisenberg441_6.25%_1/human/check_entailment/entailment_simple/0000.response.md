Reasoning:

1. The annotated program correctly identifies that the function `func_1` should handle the logic of removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
2. The function checks for the presence of the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them iteratively.
3. For the substring "map":
   - It finds the first occurrence of "map".
   - It removes "map" by slicing the string before and after "map" and concatenating the two parts.
   - It increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each removal.
4. Similarly, for the substring "pie":
   - It finds the first occurrence of "pie".
   - It removes "pie" by slicing the string before and after "pie" and concatenating the two parts.
   - It increments the counter `ans` by 1 for each removal.
5. After processing both substrings, the function returns the total count of removals (`ans`), which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
