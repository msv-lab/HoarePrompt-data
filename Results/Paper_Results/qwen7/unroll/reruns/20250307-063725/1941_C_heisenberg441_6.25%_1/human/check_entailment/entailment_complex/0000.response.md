Reasoning:

The annotated program does not fully address the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` only handles the removal of the substring "pie" and returns the count of how many times "pie" was found and removed. However, the problem requires handling both substrings "pie" and "map" and ensuring that the string becomes beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. 

The function `func_1` should handle both substrings correctly and ensure that the string is made beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    # Remove all occurrences of 'map'
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 3:]
        ans += 1
    # Remove all occurrences of 'pie'
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 3:]
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

This corrected function ensures that all occurrences of both "map" and "pie" are removed, and the count of removed characters is returned. Given this analysis, the original function does not correctly implement the solution as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
