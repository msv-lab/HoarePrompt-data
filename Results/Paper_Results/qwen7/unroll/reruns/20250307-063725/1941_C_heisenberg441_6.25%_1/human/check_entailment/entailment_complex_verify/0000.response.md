### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Original Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'`. If true, it returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `ans` to 0.
   - It then removes all occurrences of the substring `'map'` by finding and replacing them, incrementing `ans` each time.
   - Similarly, it removes all occurrences of the substring `'pie'` by finding and replacing them, again incrementing `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans`.

2. **Handling Overlapping Substrings**:
   - The function uses `s.find('map')` and `s.find('pie')` which only find the first occurrence of the substring and do not account for overlapping instances.
   - For example, in the string `"mapmap"`, the function will only remove the first `'map'` and leave the second `'map'` intact, resulting in `"map"` still being present in the string.

3. **Correctness Issue**:
   - As noted in the original assessment, the function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. It only removes the first occurrence of each substring and does not ensure that all occurrences are removed.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment suggests using the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of the substrings, which is a valid approach to ensure all overlapping instances are handled.

Here is the corrected version of the function as suggested:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        # Remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'
        s = s.replace('map', '', s.count('map'))
        s = s.replace('pie', '', s.count('pie'))
        return len(s)
    return 0
```

#### Evaluation:
- The original program fails to handle overlapping substrings correctly.
- The suggested correction using `replace` ensures that all occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'` are removed, even if they overlap.
- The corrected function will correctly compute the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The original program is indeed incorrect due to its failure to handle overlapping substrings, and the suggested correction is correct.

### Final:
Final: **False**
