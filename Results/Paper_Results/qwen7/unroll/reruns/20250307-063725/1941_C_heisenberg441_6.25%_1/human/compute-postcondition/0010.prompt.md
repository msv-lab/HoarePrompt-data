You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6.
def func_1(s):
    if (s == 'mapie') :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6, and s is not equal to 'mapie'
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: The variable `ans` will be the number of times the substring 'map' appears in the string `s`, and `s` will be the original string with all occurrences of 'map' removed.
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        
        ans += 1
        
    #State: The string `s` has all occurrences of 'pie' replaced with '', and `ans` is the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.
    return ans
    #The program returns the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed from string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. It returns 1 if the substring 'pie' is not found in the string s. Otherwise, it returns the count of how many times the substring 'pie' was found and removed from the string s.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed from string 's'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
