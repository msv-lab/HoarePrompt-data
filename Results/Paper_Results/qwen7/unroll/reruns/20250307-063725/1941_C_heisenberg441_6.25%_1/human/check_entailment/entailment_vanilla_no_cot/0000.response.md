Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks for the exact substrings "mapie" and does not properly remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate all occurrences of "map" and "pie". Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` should check for both "map" and "pie" in the string and remove them efficiently.
2. The current implementation only handles the exact match "mapie" and does not handle other variations of "map" and "pie".

To fix this, the function needs to correctly identify and remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" by updating the string and counting deletions appropriately. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while 'map' in s:
        s = s.replace('map', '', 1)
        ans += 1
    while 'pie' in s:
        s = s.replace('pie', '', 1)
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

This corrected function uses the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "map" and "pie" in each iteration, ensuring that the minimum number of deletions are made.
