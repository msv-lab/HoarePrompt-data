Output State: **The string `s` has all occurrences of 'pie' replaced with '', and `ans` is the count of how many times 'pie' was found and removed.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`. Each time 'pie' is found, it is replaced with an empty string (`''`), effectively removing it from `s`. The variable `ans` keeps a count of how many times this replacement operation occurs. Once there are no more occurrences of 'pie' in `s`, the loop stops, and the final states of `s` and `ans` are as described.
