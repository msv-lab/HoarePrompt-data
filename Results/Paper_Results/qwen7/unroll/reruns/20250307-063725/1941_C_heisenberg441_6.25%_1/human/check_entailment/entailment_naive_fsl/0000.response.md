Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the removal of overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the input string "mapmap", the program will only remove one instance of "map" and will not remove the second instance, resulting in "map" still being present in the string. This means that the string is not made beautiful, and the program should return 2 instead of 1. 

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed, even if they overlap. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if 'map' in s or 'pie' in s:
        # Remove all occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'
        s = s.replace('map', '', s.count('map'))
        s = s.replace('pie', '', s.count('pie'))
        return len(s)
    return 0
```

This version ensures that all instances of "map" and "pie" are removed, even if they overlap, and returns the correct number of deletions needed to make the string beautiful.
