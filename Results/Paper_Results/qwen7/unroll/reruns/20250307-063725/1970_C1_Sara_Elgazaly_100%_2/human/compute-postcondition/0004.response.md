Output State: **x is an integer, y is an integer, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, v is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; lst is a defaultdict where each key (integer) maps to a list of integers representing its adjacent nodes, and rev is a defaultdict where each key (integer) maps to a list of integers representing its reverse adjacency nodes based on the edges provided in the loop.**
