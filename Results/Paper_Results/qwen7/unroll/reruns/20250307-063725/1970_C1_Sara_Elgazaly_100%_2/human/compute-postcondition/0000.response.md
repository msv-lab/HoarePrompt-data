Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

In this output state, the variables `x` and `y` have been updated to integers obtained from the input, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.
