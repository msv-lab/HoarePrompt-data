Output State: `one` is flipped to its opposite value, `two` is False, `tmp` is equal to the last element in the list that was originally assigned to `tmp`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `rev[tmp]` is not empty. Inside the loop, `two` is toggled (flipped) with each iteration, and `tmp` is set to the last element in the list `rev[tmp]`. After all iterations, `two` will be False if it started as True (or True if it started as False), because it is toggled with each iteration. `tmp` will be set to the last element in the list that was originally assigned to `tmp`, as the `pop()` method removes and returns the last element from the list each time the loop runs until the list is empty.
