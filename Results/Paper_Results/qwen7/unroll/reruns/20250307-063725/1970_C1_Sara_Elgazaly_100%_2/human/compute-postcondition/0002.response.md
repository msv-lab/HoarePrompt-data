Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict with default factory `list`, `rev` is a defaultdict with default factory `list`**.

Explanation: The line `rev = defaultdict(list)` creates a new dictionary named `rev` where the default factory for the values is `list`. This means that any key that does not exist in `rev` will automatically have an empty list as its value. The values of other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `lst`) remain unchanged.
