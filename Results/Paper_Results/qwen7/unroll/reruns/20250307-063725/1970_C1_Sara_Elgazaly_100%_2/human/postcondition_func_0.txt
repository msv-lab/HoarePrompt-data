The function reads input values for \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\), constructs a graph represented by two dictionaries (`lst` and `rev`), and then determines whether certain conditions about the graph's structure are met. Specifically, it checks if traversing the graph in one direction results in an alternating pattern (storing odd/even nodes) and if traversing the graph in the reverse direction also results in an alternating pattern. Based on these checks, it prints either "Hermione" or "Ron".
