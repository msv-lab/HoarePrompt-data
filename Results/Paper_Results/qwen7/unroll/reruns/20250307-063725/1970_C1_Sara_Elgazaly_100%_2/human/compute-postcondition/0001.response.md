Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict with default factory `list`.**

The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `lst` can be used to store lists against each key, and if a key is accessed that does not exist, it will automatically create a new list for that key. No changes are made to the values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, or the list of starting nodes.
