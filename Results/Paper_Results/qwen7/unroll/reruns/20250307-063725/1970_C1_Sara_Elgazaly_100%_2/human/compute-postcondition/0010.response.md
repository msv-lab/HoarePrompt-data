Output State: **`one` is flipped to its opposite value, `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict, `two` is True.**

Explanation: 
- The variable `two` is assigned the value `True`, which does not affect the values of `one` or `tmp`.
- The variable `one` is flipped to its opposite value, meaning if `one` was `True`, it becomes `False`, and vice versa.
- The variable `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict, which does not change its reference but updates its value to the last element of its list.
