Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It checks if the given conditions for n, t, u, v, and the list of starting nodes are met and returns whether these conditions are satisfied.**

This means the function verifies that:
- `n` is an integer within the range [2, 2 Ã— 10^5].
- `t` equals 1.
- Both `u` and `v` are integers within the range [1, n].
- The list of starting nodes contains exactly one integer `u_1` within the range [1, n].

If all these conditions are true, the function returns that the conditions are satisfied. Otherwise, it returns that they are not.
