Output State: **The variable `one` will be flipped to its opposite value, and `tmp` will be set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as there are elements in the list associated with `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict. In each iteration, the value of `one` is toggled (flipped from True to False or vice versa), and then the last element of the list associated with `tmp` is popped and assigned to `tmp`. This process continues until the list for `tmp` becomes empty. At that point, `one` will have been toggled an odd number of times if the original list had an odd number of elements, or an even number of times if the original list had an even number of elements. `tmp` will hold the last element that was in the list before it became empty.
