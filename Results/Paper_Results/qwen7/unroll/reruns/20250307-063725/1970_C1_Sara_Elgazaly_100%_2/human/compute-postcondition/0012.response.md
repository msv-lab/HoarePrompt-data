Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `rev[tmp] != []`. This means the loop will continue as long as the list `rev[tmp]` is not empty.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `one` is flipped to its opposite value.
   - `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict.
   - `two` is True.
   - `tmp` is equal to `z`.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**:
   - The only variable involved in the loop condition is `tmp`. We need to ensure that `rev[tmp]` is not empty for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict, we need to ensure that this list is not empty.
   - Therefore, the state before the loop should reflect that `rev[tmp]` is not empty.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `rev[tmp]` is not empty.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`one` is flipped to its opposite value, `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict, `two` is True, `tmp` is equal to `z`, and `rev[tmp]` is not empty**
