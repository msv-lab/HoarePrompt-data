Output State: **`one` is flipped to its opposite value, `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict, `two` is True, `tmp` is equal to `z`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `z` to `tmp`. The value of `one` is flipped to its opposite value, `tmp` is set to the last element in the list corresponding to the original `tmp` in the `lst` defaultdict, and `two` remains True.
