The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and a description of 2n cards. It identifies pairs of cards of the same suit and prints them in ascending order. If there are cards matching the trump suit, it pairs them with the highest available card of the same suit. If no valid pairs can be formed, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" for each unmatched card. Finally, it prints any remaining pairs of cards from the trump suit.
