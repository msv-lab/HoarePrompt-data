Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The loop will execute until the `trumps` list is empty. Each iteration of the loop pops two elements from the end of the `trumps` list and prints them as a pair, followed by the `trump` suit. Since `trumps` is initially an empty list, the loop will not execute any iterations, and no output will be produced.

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes, the `trumps` list remains empty, and no pairs of ranks with the suit have been printed. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged from their initial states.
Code of the loop:

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
