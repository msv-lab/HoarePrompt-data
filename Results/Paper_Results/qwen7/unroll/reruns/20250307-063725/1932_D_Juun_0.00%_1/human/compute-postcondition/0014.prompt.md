Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a sorted list of the original trumps, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
