Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS"; an additional input is taken and stored but no variable is updated with its value.**

Explanation: The code `input()` reads an input from the user but does not assign it to any existing variable. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. An additional input is taken and stored internally, but since no variable is updated with this input, the values of the existing variables are the same as before.
