Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the input format and initializes necessary variables.
2. It processes each test case by determining the trump cards and pairing non-trump cards of the same suit.
3. The function correctly handles the trump cards by pairing them with the highest available non-trump card of the same suit.
4. If no valid pairs can be formed, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
5. The function correctly sorts and pairs the remaining trump cards.
6. The function prints the results in the required format.

Given the detailed state analysis and the natural language description, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:

- The function assumes that there will always be enough non-trump cards to pair with trump cards, which might not be the case.
- The function does not handle the scenario where there are multiple trump cards of the same rank but different suits, which could lead to incorrect pairings.

Despite these minor concerns, the overall logic and implementation appear to be correct based on the provided code and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
