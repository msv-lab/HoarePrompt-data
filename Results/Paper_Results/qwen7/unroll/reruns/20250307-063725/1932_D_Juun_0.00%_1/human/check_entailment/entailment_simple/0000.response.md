Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.
3. The program attempts to reconstruct the rounds by:
   - Identifying which cards are trump cards and storing their ranks.
   - Matching non-trump cards of the same suit, ensuring the lower rank comes first.
   - Handling remaining trump cards by comparing them in descending order.
4. The logic for handling the suits and ranks seems to cover the rules of the game:
   - Non-trump cards of the same suit are matched according to their ranks.
   - Trump cards can beat any non-trump card, and among themselves, they are matched in descending order.
5. The program outputs the results in the required format or indicates "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid reconstruction is possible.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the rules and requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
