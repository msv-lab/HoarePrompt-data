Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes the `answers` list as an empty list. The values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged from their initial state.
