Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list of the original trumps, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`.**

Explanation: The line `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the `trumps` list. Since `trumps` was initially an empty list, sorting an empty list does not change its contents. Therefore, `trumps` remains an empty list after the operation. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `answers`, and `suits`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
