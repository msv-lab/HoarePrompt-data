#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings, where the first character is the rank of the card (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit of the card (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is a list of ranks that match the trump suit; `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():

            continue

            return
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`.

        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until the `trumps` list is empty. Each iteration of the loop pops two elements from the end of the `trumps` list and prints them as a pair, followed by the `trump` suit. Since `trumps` is initially an empty list, the loop will not execute any iterations, and no output will be produced.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes, the `trumps` list remains empty, and no pairs of ranks with the suit have been printed. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged from their initial states.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `answers` list remains unchanged, and no elements have been printed from it.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and a description of 2n cards. It identifies pairs of cards of the same suit and prints them in ascending order. If there are cards matching the trump suit, it pairs them with the highest available card of the same suit. If no valid pairs can be formed, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" for each unmatched card. Finally, it prints any remaining pairs of cards from the trump suit.
