Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is a list of ranks that may be empty or contain some elements, and `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values that are not `None` for suits that had items in the loop, and `None` for others. If for any suit, the `trumps` list was empty before the loop, "IMPOSSIBLE" was printed and the function returned early.
