You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings, where the first character is the rank of the card (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit of the card (one of "CDHS"). All cards are different.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is a list of ranks that match the trump suit; `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is an input value; `trumps` is an empty list; `answers` is a list of strings where each string represents a pair of ranks from the same suit, with the lower rank first and then the higher rank, and `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to `None`.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will execute until the `trumps` list is empty. Each iteration of the loop pops two elements from the end of the `trumps` list and prints them as a pair, followed by the `trump` suit. Since `trumps` is initially an empty list, the loop will not execute any iterations, and no output will be produced.
    #
    #Natural Language Description: After the loop executes, the `trumps` list remains empty, and no pairs of ranks with the suit have been printed. The `answers` list and the `suits` dictionary remain unchanged from their initial states.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The `answers` list remains unchanged, and no elements have been printed from it.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a set of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and a string representing the trump suit ("CDHS"). Additionally, it processes a description of 2n cards, each represented as a two-character string where the first character is the rank ("23456789") and the second character is the suit ("CDHS"). All cards are unique. The function does not return a specific value but processes the input data according to the given constraints and descriptions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
