Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the discard pile contains more than one non-trump card of the same suit after the trump card has been placed. Hereâ€™s an example to illustrate this issue:

Consider the following input:
```
1
2
H
3C 9S 3D 3H
```

According to the problem description, the sequence of moves should be:
1. Player 1 plays 3C (clubs), which is not a trump card.
2. Player 2 must play a card that beats 3C. Since 3D and 3H are both higher than 3C, either could be valid. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.

The program logic in `func_1` does not properly manage the scenario where multiple non-trump cards of the same suit exist in the discard pile. It only checks if the suit of the card matches the trump suit and does not ensure that the second player's card beats the first player's card correctly.

This leads to an incorrect output or no solution being found in such cases, making the program incorrect according to the problem description.
