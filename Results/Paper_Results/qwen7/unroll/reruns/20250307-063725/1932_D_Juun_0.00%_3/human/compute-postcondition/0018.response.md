Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and 2n unique cards. It determines valid pairs of cards based on the trump suit and prints them. If no valid pairs can be formed, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. After processing all test cases, it prints any remaining valid pairs in reverse order. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
