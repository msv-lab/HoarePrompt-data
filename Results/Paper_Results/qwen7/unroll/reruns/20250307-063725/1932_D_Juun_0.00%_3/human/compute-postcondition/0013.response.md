Output State: **The loop will print pairs of elements from the `trumps` list, each pair concatenated with the `trump` string, in reverse order until the `trumps` list is empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `trumps` list. In each iteration, it pops two elements from the end of the `trumps` list and prints them concatenated with the `trump` string. This process repeats until the `trumps` list is empty. Therefore, the output will be a series of printed statements, each containing two elements from the original `trumps` list, in reverse order, followed by the `trump` string.
