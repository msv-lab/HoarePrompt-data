Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trump` is a string, `trumps` is a sorted list, `answers` is a list of strings where each string is formatted as 'rank suit trump pop_rank pop_trump', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values being either None or a rank (string).
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
