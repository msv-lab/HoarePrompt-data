Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of cards.
3. The program processes the cards to create a sequence of moves that could have occurred during the game.
4. It handles the trump suit correctly by allowing trump cards to beat non-trump cards regardless of rank.
5. The logic for determining which card beats another is correct, considering both the same-suit and trump rules.
6. The program outputs the correct format for each move or indicates "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid sequence can be constructed.
7. The final loop correctly prints out the answers in the required format.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided code and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
