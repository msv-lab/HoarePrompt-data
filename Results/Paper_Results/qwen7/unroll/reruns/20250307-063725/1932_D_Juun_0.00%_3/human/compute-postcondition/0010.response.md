Output State: `trump` is a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of strings where each string is formatted as 'rank suit trump pop_rank pop_trump', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values being either None or a rank (string). Only entries in `suits` with non-None values are considered in `answers`. If for any suit, `trumps` becomes empty before processing all ranks, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed and the function returns early.
