Output State: **`trump` is a string, `trumps` is a sorted list, `answers` is a list of strings where each string is formatted as 'rank suit trump pop_rank pop_trump', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values being either None or a rank (string).**

Explanation: The line `trumps = sorted(trumps)` sorts the list `trumps` in ascending order. Since the initial state of `trumps` is an empty list, sorting an empty list does not change its content. Therefore, `trumps` remains an empty list after the sorting operation. All other variables (`trump`, `answers`, `suits`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
