Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the input structure and constraints.
2. It initializes necessary variables and processes each test case appropriately.
3. The logic for determining valid pairs of cards based on the trump suit is correct.
4. The function correctly handles scenarios where no valid pairs can be formed by printing "IMPOSSIBLE".
5. The function processes the remaining valid pairs in reverse order after the initial processing, ensuring all valid pairs are accounted for.
6. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
