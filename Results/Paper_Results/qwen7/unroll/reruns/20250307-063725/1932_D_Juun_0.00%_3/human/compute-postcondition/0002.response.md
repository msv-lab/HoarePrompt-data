Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string read from input(), trumps is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `trumps`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the trump suit. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
