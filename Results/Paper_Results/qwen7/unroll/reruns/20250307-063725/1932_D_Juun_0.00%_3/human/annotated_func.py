#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains 2n unique cards, each described by a two-character string where the first character is the rank (one of "23456789") and the second character is the suit (one of "CDHS").
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []

    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}

            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, `trump` is a string, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings), `answers` is a list of strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values being either None or a rank (string).
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue

        else:

            return
        
    #State: Output State: `trump` is a string, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of strings where each string is formatted as 'rank suit trump pop_rank pop_trump', `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values being either None or a rank (string). Only entries in `suits` with non-None values are considered in `answers`. If for any suit, `trumps` becomes empty before processing all ranks, 'IMPOSSIBLE' is printed and the function returns early.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)

        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The loop will print pairs of elements from the `trumps` list, each pair concatenated with the `trump` string, in reverse order until the `trumps` list is empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The loop does not modify any state and only prints elements. Since there are no elements to print in the given loop, the output state remains unchanged. No output is produced.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and 2n unique cards. It determines valid pairs of cards based on the trump suit and prints them. If no valid pairs can be formed, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. After processing all test cases, it prints any remaining valid pairs in reverse order. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
