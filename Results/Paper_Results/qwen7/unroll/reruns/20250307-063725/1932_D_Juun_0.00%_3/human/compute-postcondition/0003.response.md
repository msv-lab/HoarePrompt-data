Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string read from input(), trumps is an empty list, `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. No changes are made to the values of `t`, `n`, or the `trump suit`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The `trumps` list remains empty as well.
