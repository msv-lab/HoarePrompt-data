Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - It then reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of shuffled cards.

2. **Processing Cards**:
   - The program initializes an empty list `trumps` to store the ranks of trump cards.
   - It also initializes a dictionary `suits` to keep track of the highest non-trump card for each suit.
   - For each card, it checks if the card is a trump card and adds its rank to `trumps`.
   - If the card is not a trump card, it checks if there's already a highest non-trump card for that suit. If so, it forms a valid move and updates the `suits` dictionary. Otherwise, it updates the `suits` dictionary with the current card's rank.

3. **Handling Remaining Non-Trump Cards**:
   - After processing all cards, the program checks if there are any remaining non-trump cards. If there are no trump cards left, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE" and returns.
   - If there are trump cards left, it pairs them with the remaining highest non-trump cards (if any).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the reconstructed rounds, ensuring that the output format matches the requirements.

The program handles all the given constraints and examples correctly. It processes the cards according to the rules of the game and outputs a valid sequence of moves or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid sequence exists.

Correctness: **True**
