Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head variables in the given for loop are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `index` is given as `4 + 4 * t`, where `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for the corresponding iteration.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `results`, the state of `results` must be such that it contains at least one element. Therefore, `results` must have at least one element.
   - The variable `result` will take on the value of each element in `results` during each iteration of the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `results` must have at least one element.
- `t` must be a positive integer (since `results` is a list of length `t`).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element, `t` is a positive integer obtained from `int(data[0])`**.
