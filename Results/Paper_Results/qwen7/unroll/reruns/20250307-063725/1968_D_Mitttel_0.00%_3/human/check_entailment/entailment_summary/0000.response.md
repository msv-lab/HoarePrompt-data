Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases. It ensures that for each test case, it extracts the necessary parameters and passes them to `func_1` for further processing.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function. It correctly compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
3. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function accurately calculates the score for a given starting position. It handles both non-cyclic and cyclic scenarios correctly. If a cycle is detected, it properly accounts for the repeated cycle within the total steps `k`.

Given that all functions work as intended and collectively meet the problem requirements, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
