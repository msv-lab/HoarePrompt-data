Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the score for a given starting position by following the rules of the game. It correctly handles the calculation of scores for both players and determines the winner based on these scores.
2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function calculates the score for a given starting position by considering both direct moves and cycles in the permutation. It accurately computes the score by summing the values in the array `a` according to the permutation `p` and handling cycles appropriately.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function processes multiple test cases. It reads input from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results. The logic for reading input and processing test cases is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

Given that:
- The logic in `func_1` is correct and handles all possible scenarios (winning, losing, or drawing).
- The `calculate_score` function correctly computes the score, including handling cycles.
- The `func_2` function correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

The program as provided is logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
