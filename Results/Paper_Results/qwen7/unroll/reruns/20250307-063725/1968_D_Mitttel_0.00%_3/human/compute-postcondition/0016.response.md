Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is the difference between `steps` and `cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_pos` is equal to `p[cycle_pos - 1]`**.

Explanation: The code calculates the number of full cycles that can be completed with `remaining_steps` by performing integer division (`//`) with `cycle_length`. This results in the value of `full_cycles`. The remainder of these steps after completing the full cycles is stored back in `remaining_steps` using the modulus operator (`%`). The values of `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, and `cycle_pos` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
