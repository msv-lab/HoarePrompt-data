Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Scores**: The `func_1` function calls `calculate_score` for both players but does not account for the fact that players can choose to stay or move to `p[x]`. The `calculate_score` function only considers the movement without allowing the player to decide whether to stay or move.

2. **Missing Movement Logic**: In the `calculate_score` function, the logic for deciding whether to stay or move to `p[x]` is missing. The function only moves to `p[x]` every step, which is not how the game rules are described.

3. **Cycle Handling**: The `calculate_score` function correctly handles cycles but does not implement the decision-making process for staying or moving to `p[x]`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    def calculate_score(start_pos):
        score = 0
        current_pos = start_pos
        steps = 0
        visited = {}
        cycle_start = -1
        while steps < k:
            if current_pos in visited:
                cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
                break
            visited[current_pos] = steps
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            steps += 1
            if steps >= k:
                return score
            # Decide whether to stay or move to p[x]
            if steps < k and (steps + 1) % 2 == 0:
                current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
            else:
                current_pos = current_pos  # Stay at the current position
        if cycle_start != -1:
            cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
            cycle_score = 0
            cycle_pos = current_pos
            for _ in range(cycle_length):
                cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
                cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
            remaining_steps = k - steps
            full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
            remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
            score += full_cycles * cycle_score
            for _ in range(remainder_steps):
                score += a[current_pos - 1]
                current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
        return score

    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        index += 4
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage:
func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that both players can choose to stay or move to `p[x]` at each step, and it correctly calculates their scores based on these choices.
