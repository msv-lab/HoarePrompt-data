Output State: **`index` is 0, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a.**

The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect any of the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the only change is that `index` is now set to 0. All other variables retain their initial states.
