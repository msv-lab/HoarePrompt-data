Output State: **`remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_length` is the difference between `steps` and `cycle_start`, where `cycle_start` is not -1 indicating a cycle was detected; `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`; `cycle_pos` is equal to `p[cycle_pos - 1]`.**

Explanation: The variable `remaining_steps` is assigned the value of `k - steps`. The values of `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `cycle_start`, `steps`, and the array `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
