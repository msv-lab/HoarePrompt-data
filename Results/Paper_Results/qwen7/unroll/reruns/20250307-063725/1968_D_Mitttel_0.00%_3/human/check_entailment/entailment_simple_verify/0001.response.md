### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct as it correctly uses the results from `calculate_score`.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It handles two main scenarios:
     - **No cycle**: If no cycle is detected within `k` steps, it simply accumulates the score for each step.
     - **Cycle detection**: If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The logic for handling cycles is correct. It correctly identifies the cycle start, calculates the cycle length and score, and then computes the total score by accounting for full cycles and any remaining steps.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input parsing and processing logic seem correct.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound. It correctly handles the game rules, including the possibility of cycles, and determines the winner based on the scores.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly initializes the scores for Bodya and Sasha using `calculate_score`.
  - It then compares these scores and returns the appropriate result.
  - The logic is consistent with the problem statement.

- **Function `calculate_score`**:
  - The function correctly handles both the scenario where no cycle is detected and the scenario where a cycle is detected.
  - It uses a dictionary `visited` to detect cycles and accurately calculates the score considering the cycle length and remaining steps.
  - The logic for handling cycles is sound and matches the problem requirements.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The input parsing and processing logic are correct and align with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code and the annotated version, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem description. The functions handle all necessary aspects of the problem, including cycle detection and scoring, and the overall logic is sound.
