### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores to determine the winner.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function is designed to calculate the score for a given starting position.
   - The logic for handling both the scenario without a cycle and the scenario with a cycle is correct.
   - However, there is a subtle issue in the way the cycle is handled. Specifically, the function should ensure that the cycle is fully processed before moving to the remaining steps. The current implementation might miss some steps if the remaining steps do not complete a full cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input parsing and processing logic is correct.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is generally sound, but there is a potential issue with the cycle handling in `calculate_score`.

### Detailed Analysis:

In `calculate_score`, the function correctly identifies cycles and calculates the score for the cycle. However, when handling the remaining steps, it should ensure that the remaining steps are fully accounted for. Specifically, the function should process the remaining steps even if they do not complete a full cycle. Here is the problematic part of the code:

```python
if cycle_start != -1:
    cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
    cycle_score = 0
    cycle_pos = current_pos
    for _ in range(cycle_length):
        cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
        cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
    remaining_steps = k - steps
    full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
    remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
    score += full_cycles * cycle_score
    for _ in range(remainder_steps):
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
```

The issue arises when `remaining_steps` is less than `cycle_length`. In such cases, the loop `for _ in range(remainder_steps)` will not execute, and the remaining steps will not be processed. This can lead to incorrect scores if the remaining steps are significant.

To fix this, the function should ensure that all remaining steps are processed, even if they do not complete a full cycle. One way to do this is to continue processing the remaining steps until `steps` reaches `k`.

### Corrected Code:

Here is the corrected version of `calculate_score`:

```python
def calculate_score(start_pos):
    score = 0
    current_pos = start_pos
    steps = 0
    visited = {}
    cycle_start = -1
    while steps < k:
        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break
        visited[current_pos] = steps
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        steps += 1
        if steps >= k:
            return score
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    if cycle_start != -1:
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos
        for _ in range(cycle_length):
            cycle_score += a[cycle_pos - 1]
            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score
        for _ in range(remainder_steps):
            score += a[current_pos - 1]
            current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

This ensures that all remaining steps are processed, even if they do not complete a full cycle.
