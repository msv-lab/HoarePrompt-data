Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is the difference between `steps` and `cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_pos` is equal to `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`**.

Explanation: The line `score += full_cycles * cycle_score` adds the product of `full_cycles` and `cycle_score` to `score`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, and `remainder_steps` retain their previous values, while `score` is updated to include the new value.
