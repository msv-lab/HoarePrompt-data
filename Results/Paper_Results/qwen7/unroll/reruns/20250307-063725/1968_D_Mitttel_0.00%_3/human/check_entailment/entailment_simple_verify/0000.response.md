### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function 1: `func_1`
This function calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores. However, as noted in the original assessment, the `calculate_score` function only considers the score for one player and does not simulate the simultaneous moves of both players. This is a critical flaw because the problem requires considering the simultaneous moves of both players.

#### Function 2: `calculate_score`
This function calculates the score for a single player by simulating the game steps. It correctly handles cycles in the permutation, but it does not account for the simultaneous moves of both players. The function assumes that the player will always stay at their current position, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

#### Function 3: `func_2`
This function reads input and processes multiple test cases, calling `func_1` for each test case. The issue lies in the implementation of `func_1`, which relies on the flawed `calculate_score` function.

Given the problem description, the key points are:
1. Both players make moves simultaneously.
2. Each player can either stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.
3. The score is calculated based on the moves made by both players.

The provided code does not correctly simulate these simultaneous moves. Instead, it only considers the score for one player and assumes they always stay at their current position, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating scores for both players due to the flawed `calculate_score` function. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
