Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head uses the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `remainder_steps`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `remainder_steps` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `remainder_steps` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. The other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`, `score`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and can remain unchanged.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is `remainder_steps` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**State:**
**`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is the difference between `steps` and `cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_pos` is equal to `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `score` is `score + full_cycles * cycle_score`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length` and must be greater than 0**
