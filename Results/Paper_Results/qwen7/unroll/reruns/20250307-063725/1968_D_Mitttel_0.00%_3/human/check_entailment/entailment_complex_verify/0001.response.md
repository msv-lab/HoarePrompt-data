### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares their scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - The logic in `func_1` seems correct as it correctly uses the results from `calculate_score`.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It handles two main scenarios:
     - **No cycle**: If no cycle is detected within `k` steps, it simply accumulates the score for each step.
     - **Cycle detection**: If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the cycle and the remaining steps.
   - The logic for handling cycles is correct. It correctly identifies the cycle start, calculates the cycle length and score, and then computes the total score by accounting for full cycles and any remaining steps.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The input parsing and processing logic seem correct.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The overall logic of the program is sound. It correctly handles the game rules, including the possibility of cycles, and determines the winner based on the scores.

### Analysis of Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compares their scores.
  - The logic for determining the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct.

- **Function `calculate_score`**:
  - The function correctly calculates the score for a given starting position.
  - It handles both scenarios of no cycle and cycle detection accurately.
  - The logic for identifying cycles and computing the total score is correct.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
  - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
  - The input parsing and processing logic are correct.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the annotated code and the original assessment, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem description. The functions handle all necessary aspects of the problem, including cycle detection and scoring.
