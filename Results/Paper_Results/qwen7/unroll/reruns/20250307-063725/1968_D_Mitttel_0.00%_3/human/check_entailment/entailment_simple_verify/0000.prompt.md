You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

    Draw
    Bodya
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Sasha
    Bodya
    
Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #
    #Explanation: During each iteration of the loop, the code updates the `score` by adding the element from `a` at the position indicated by `current_pos - 1`. It also keeps track of the `current_pos` using the permutation list `p` and increments the `steps` counter. If the `current_pos` has been visited before within the same loop (indicating a cycle), the loop breaks and returns the `score`. If the loop completes without finding a cycle and `steps` equals `k`, it returns the accumulated `score`. The `visited` dictionary records the step at which each position was first visited to detect cycles.

        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length

If a cycle is detected, the `score` is updated by adding the sum of elements in `a` at the positions indicated by the cycle until the cycle ends.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function only calculates the score for one player and does not consider the simultaneous moves of both players. The function assumes that the player will always stay at their current position, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(a_3 = 5\).
    - Bodya can stay at position 3 or move to position 2 (since \(p_3 = 2\)).
    - Sasha's score: \(a_2 = 2\).
    - Sasha can stay at position 2 or move to position 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\)).
  - After the second turn:
    - If Bodya stays at position 3, his score becomes \(5 + a_3 = 10\).
    - If Bodya moves to position 2, his score becomes \(5 + a_2 = 7\).
    - If Sasha stays at position 2, his score becomes \(2 + a_2 = 4\).
    - If Sasha moves to position 1, his score becomes \(2 + a_1 = 9\).

The program does not account for these simultaneous moves and always assumes the player stays at their current position, which leads to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
