Output State: **full_cycles is full_cycles, remaining_steps is 0, cycle_length is cycle_length, cycle_score is cycle_score, cycle_pos is cycle_pos, score is score + full_cycles * cycle_score + sum(a[current_pos - 1] for _ in range(remainder_steps)), remainder_steps is 0**.

This means that after the loop executes all the iterations:
- The number of full cycles remains the same.
- The remaining steps become 0 after completing the loop.
- The cycle length remains unchanged.
- The cycle score remains the same.
- The cycle position remains unchanged.
- The score is updated to include the full cycles' score plus the score gained from the remaining steps.
- The remainder steps become 0 after the loop completes.
