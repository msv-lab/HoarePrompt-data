Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function only calculates the score for one player and does not consider the simultaneous moves of both players. The function assumes that the player will always stay at their current position, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(a_3 = 5\).
    - Bodya can stay at position 3 or move to position 2 (since \(p_3 = 2\)).
    - Sasha's score: \(a_2 = 2\).
    - Sasha can stay at position 2 or move to position 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\)).
  - After the second turn:
    - If Bodya stays at position 3, his score becomes \(5 + a_3 = 10\).
    - If Bodya moves to position 2, his score becomes \(5 + a_2 = 7\).
    - If Sasha stays at position 2, his score becomes \(2 + a_2 = 4\).
    - If Sasha moves to position 1, his score becomes \(2 + a_1 = 9\).

The program does not account for these simultaneous moves and always assumes the player stays at their current position, which leads to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
