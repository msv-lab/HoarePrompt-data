### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Function `calculate_score` Analysis:
- The function `calculate_score` calculates the score for a single player starting from a given position.
- It simulates the player's movement through the permutation `p` and accumulates the score from the array `a`.
- If a cycle is detected, it accounts for the cycle by calculating the total score for the cycle and the remaining steps outside the cycle.
- However, the function does not simulate the simultaneous moves of both players. Instead, it assumes that the player will always stay at their current position, which is incorrect according to the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` uses `calculate_score` to get the scores for both players.
- It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
- Since `calculate_score` does not account for the simultaneous moves, the comparison of scores is also incorrect.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input and processes multiple test cases.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
- The input reading and processing part seems correct, but the core logic in `func_1` and `calculate_score` is flawed.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the provided test case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 3.
  - Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(a_3 = 5\).
    - Bodya can stay at position 3 or move to position 2 (since \(p_3 = 2\)).
    - Sasha's score: \(a_2 = 2\).
    - Sasha can stay at position 2 or move to position 1 (since \(p_2 = 1\)).
  - After the second turn:
    - If Bodya stays at position 3, his score becomes \(5 + a_3 = 10\).
    - If Bodya moves to position 2, his score becomes \(5 + a_2 = 7\).
    - If Sasha stays at position 2, his score becomes \(2 + a_2 = 4\).
    - If Sasha moves to position 1, his score becomes \(2 + a_1 = 9\).

The provided program does not account for these simultaneous moves and always assumes the player stays at their current position, leading to incorrect results.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating scores for both players due to the assumption that players always stay at their current position instead of considering simultaneous moves.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
