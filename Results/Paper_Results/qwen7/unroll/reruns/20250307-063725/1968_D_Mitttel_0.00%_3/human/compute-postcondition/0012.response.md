Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5), k (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), and two lists p and a (both lists contain n integers). The function processes each test case defined by these parameters and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This functionality describes a function that takes multiple parameters including the number of test cases, constraints on n and k, indices PB and PS, and two lists p and a. It processes each test case according to the provided parameters and returns a result without detailing the internal operations.
