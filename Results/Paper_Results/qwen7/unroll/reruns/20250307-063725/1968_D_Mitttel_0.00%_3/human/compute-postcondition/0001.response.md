Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
