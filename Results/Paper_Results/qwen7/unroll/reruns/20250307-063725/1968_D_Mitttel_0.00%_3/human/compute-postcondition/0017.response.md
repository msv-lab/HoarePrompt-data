Output State: **`full_cycles` is `remaining_steps // cycle_length`, `remaining_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_length` is the difference between `steps` and `cycle_start`, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements in the array `a` from `cycle_pos - 1 - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_pos` is equal to `p[cycle_pos - 1]`, `remainder_steps` is `remaining_steps % cycle_length`**.

Explanation: The code updates the variable `remainder_steps` to be the remainder when `remaining_steps` is divided by `cycle_length`. The other variables (`full_cycles`, `remaining_steps`, `cycle_length`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_pos`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
