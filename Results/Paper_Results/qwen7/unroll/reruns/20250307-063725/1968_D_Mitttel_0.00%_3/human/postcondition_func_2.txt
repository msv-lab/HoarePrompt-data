The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), \( PB \), \( PS \), and two lists \( p \) and \( a \) of length \( n \). It then calls another function `func_1` with these parameters to compute a result. After processing all test cases, it prints the results for each test case.
