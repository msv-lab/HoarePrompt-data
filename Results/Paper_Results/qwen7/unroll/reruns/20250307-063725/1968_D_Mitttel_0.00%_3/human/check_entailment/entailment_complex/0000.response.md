Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions and the rules of the game. It uses the `calculate_score` function to get the score for each player and compares the scores to determine the winner. The logic in `func_1` is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function accurately computes the score for a given starting position by following the rules of the game. It handles both non-cyclic and cyclic permutations correctly. The function accounts for cycles by calculating the score for the cycle and then adjusting the remaining steps to account for complete cycles and any remaining steps. The logic here is sound and matches the problem requirements.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly processes multiple test cases by reading input, calling `func_1` for each test case, and printing the results. The way it reads and processes the input is consistent with the problem constraints and the expected format of the input.

Given that all functions work as intended and collectively meet the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
