Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This does not change the values of the other variables. It just updates which function `input` refers to.
