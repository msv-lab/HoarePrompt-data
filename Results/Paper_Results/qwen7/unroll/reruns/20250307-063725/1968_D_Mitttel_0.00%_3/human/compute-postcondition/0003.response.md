Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`**.

The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `t`. Since `index` is initially 0, `data[index]` refers to the first element of the list `data`. The value of `index` is then updated to 1. The value of `t` is the integer representation of the first element of the list `data`. All other variables remain unchanged.
