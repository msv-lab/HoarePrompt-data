### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the provided program based on the problem statement and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. However, it is not used in the solution, which is a red flag.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to solve a different problem. Specifically, it computes a series involving \(n\) and \(m\), but it does not address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Test Cases**:
   - For the input \((3, 5)\), the expected output is `4` (pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5)).
   - For the input \((10, 8)\), the expected output is `14` (pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)).

4. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - It computes \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.

This approach does not directly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve a different problem, likely related to some other mathematical series.

Given the discrepancy between the expected results and the actual output of the provided program, it is clear that the program does not correctly solve the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the given problem.

**Final: False**
