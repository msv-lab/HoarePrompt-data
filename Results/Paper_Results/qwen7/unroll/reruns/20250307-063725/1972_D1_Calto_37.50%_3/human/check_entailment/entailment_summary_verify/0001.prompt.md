You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), both constrained to be between 1 and \( 2 \times 10^6 \). If the computed sum \( cnt \) is zero, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the non-zero sum \( cnt \) which is the result of a series calculation involving \( n \) and \( m \).+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and will be used in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem statement requirements. Specifically:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) but should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The condition `cnt == 0` and the return value handling do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
