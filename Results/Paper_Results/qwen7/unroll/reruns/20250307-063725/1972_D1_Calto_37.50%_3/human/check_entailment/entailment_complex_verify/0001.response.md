### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. This is correct and will be used in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\), but its implementation is flawed:
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\), which is incorrect. It should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges.
   - The variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not relate to the problem constraints. Specifically, `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not represent the necessary components to check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The condition `cnt == 0` and the return value handling do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected approach:
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
   - Check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The loop and variable definitions do not align with the problem constraints.
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the logic in `func_2` is incorrect and does not meet the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_2` does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) as required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
