Output State: **The program returns the sum of the series where for each i from 1 to m-1, we compute x = n - (i * i - i) and y = i * i, then add x // y + (i > 1) to cnt. The value of cnt is not zero.**

This means the program calculates `cnt` by iterating through each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, computing `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`, and adding the integer division of `x` by `y` plus 1 if `i` is greater than 1 to `cnt`. Since `cnt` is not zero, the final value of `cnt` is returned.
