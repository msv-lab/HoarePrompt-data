### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and will be used in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` is intended to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the current implementation is flawed as follows:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) but should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The condition `cnt == 0` and the return value handling do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the function summary for `func_2`, it suggests that the function is supposed to compute a series calculation involving \(n\) and \(m\). However, the provided implementation does not reflect this. The summary indicates that the function returns 1 if `cnt` is 0, otherwise it returns `cnt`. This implies that the function should be counting something related to the problem, but the current implementation does not do so.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the correct approach:
- We need to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
- For each pair, we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- If the condition is satisfied, we increment the count.

The provided function `func_2` does not follow this logic. Instead, it uses a series of calculations that do not match the problem constraints. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

Correctness: **False**
