Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. The GCD is essential for determining if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function is correct and works as intended.

2. **Function `func_2`**: The current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze the logic:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `m-1`, computing `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - The expression `x // y + (i > 1)` is added to `cnt`.
   - The final check `if (cnt == 0): return 1` is unnecessary and misleading. The logic inside the loop does not align with the problem statement.

   The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not correctly count these pairs.

Given the analysis, the provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
