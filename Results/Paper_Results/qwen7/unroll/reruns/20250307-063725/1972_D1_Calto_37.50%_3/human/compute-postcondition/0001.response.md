Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the variables and objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop head involves the variable `i`.

2. Determine the initial values or conditions for these variables:
   - The loop starts with `i` being set to 1 (as specified in `range(1, m)`).

3. Consider the condition for the loop to continue executing:
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `m`.

4. Identify the state adjustments needed:
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and that `m` is a valid value (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6) to allow the loop to execute.

5. Ensure that no other variables outside the loop head are adjusted:
   - The variables `cnt` and `n` are not part of the loop head and should not be adjusted.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` starting at 1 and `m` being within the valid range.

State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6**
