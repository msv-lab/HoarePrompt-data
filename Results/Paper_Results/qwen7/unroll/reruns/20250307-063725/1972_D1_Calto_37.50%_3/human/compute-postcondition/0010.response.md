Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), both constrained to be between 1 and \( 2 \times 10^6 \). If the computed sum \( cnt \) is zero, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the non-zero sum \( cnt \) which is the result of a series calculation involving \( n \) and \( m \).**
