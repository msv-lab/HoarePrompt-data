### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function `func_1`:
This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. However, it is not used in the solution, which is a red flag.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is the primary function that attempts to solve the problem. Let's break down its logic:

1. **Loop through values of \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\)**:
   - For each \(i\), it computes \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
   - It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.

2. **Condition Check**:
   - If `cnt` is zero, it returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

Now, let's check if this logic correctly solves the problem.

#### Test Case Analysis:
1. **Input: (3, 5)**
   - Expected Output: 4
   - Valid pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 5)
   - The function `func_2` should count these pairs.

2. **Input: (10, 8)**
   - Expected Output: 14
   - Valid pairs: (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8), (2, 2), (2, 4), (2, 6), (3, 3), (4, 4), (5, 5)
   - The function `func_2` should count these pairs.

#### Detailed Test Case Evaluation:
- For \(i = 1\):
  - \(x = n - (1 \cdot 1 - 1) = n\)
  - \(y = 1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
  - \(cnt += n // 1 + (1 > 1) = n + 0 = n\)

- For \(i = 2\):
  - \(x = n - (2 \cdot 2 - 2) = n - 2\)
  - \(y = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)
  - \(cnt += (n - 2) // 4 + (2 > 1) = (n - 2) // 4 + 1\)

- For \(i = 3\):
  - \(x = n - (3 \cdot 3 - 3) = n - 6\)
  - \(y = 3 \cdot 3 = 9\)
  - \(cnt += (n - 6) // 9 + (3 > 1) = (n - 6) // 9 + 1\)

This logic does not seem to directly address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be calculating something else, likely due to a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The logic in `func_2` does not match the required conditions.

### Final:
Final: **False**
