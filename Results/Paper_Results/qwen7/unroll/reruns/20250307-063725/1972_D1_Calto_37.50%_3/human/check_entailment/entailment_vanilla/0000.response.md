Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **GCD Calculation Function (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It works as expected and does not need any changes.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the function is flawed and does not correctly implement the required conditions.

#### Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:

- **Loop through `i` from 1 to `m-1`**:
  - The loop iterates over values of `b` from 1 to `m-1`, which is incorrect because it should iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m`.

- **Calculations for `x` and `y`**:
  - `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not have a clear relationship with the problem statement. These calculations do not reflect the necessary conditions for the problem.

- **Counting Valid Pairs**:
  - The expression `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)` is attempting to count something but does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

- **Return Statement**:
  - If `cnt` is zero, the function returns 1, which is incorrect. The correct behavior should be to return 0 when no valid pairs are found.

### Correct Implementation

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion

The given implementation in `func_2` is incorrect due to the flawed logic and calculations. The correct approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the given condition directly.

**Correctness: False**
