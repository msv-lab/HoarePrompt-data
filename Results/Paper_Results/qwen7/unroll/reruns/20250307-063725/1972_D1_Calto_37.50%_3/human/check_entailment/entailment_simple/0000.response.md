Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The GCD is essential for determining if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The function works as expected and returns the correct GCD.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The provided implementation of `func_2` does not match the problem statement. The logic inside `func_2` does not seem to address the conditions given in the problem. Specifically, the loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `m-1`, and for each `i`, it calculates `x` and `y` in a way that doesn't align with the required conditions. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not properly handled.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach would involve iterating over possible values of `a` and `b` and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Since the provided `func_2` does not implement the correct logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
