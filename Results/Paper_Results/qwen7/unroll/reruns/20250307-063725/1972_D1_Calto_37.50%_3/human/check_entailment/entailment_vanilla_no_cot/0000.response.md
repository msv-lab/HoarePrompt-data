Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The function `func_2` uses a formula that does not relate to the problem statement. It attempts to calculate something related to squares and differences, which is not relevant to the problem of finding pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Function**: While the GCD function (`func_1`) is implemented correctly, it is not used within `func_2` to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate GCD
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Read input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This code iterates through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition using the GCD function. This approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted correctly.
