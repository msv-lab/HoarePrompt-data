### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and will be used in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem statement requirements. Specifically:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) but should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The condition `cnt == 0` and the return value handling do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
