Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the given code step-by-step.

### Problem Analysis
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis
#### Function 1 (`func_1`)
This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a necessary utility for solving the problem but does not directly solve the main problem.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`)
This function has an incorrect implementation for the problem at hand. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Loop through \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\)**:
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then updates `cnt` with `x // y + (i > 1)`.

2. **Return condition**:
   - If `cnt` is zero, it returns 1.
   - Otherwise, it returns `cnt`.

### Issues with `func_2`
1. **Incorrect Calculation**: The loop and calculations inside do not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Specifically, the expressions \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) do not relate to the problem constraints.
2. **Return Condition**: The return condition checks if `cnt` is zero and returns 1, which is not relevant to the problem. Even if `cnt` is zero, it doesn't mean there are no valid pairs; it just means the current approach is flawed.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion
Given the provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
