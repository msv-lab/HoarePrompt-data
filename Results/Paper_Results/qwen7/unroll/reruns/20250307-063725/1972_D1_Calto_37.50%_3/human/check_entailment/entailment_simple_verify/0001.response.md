### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. This part is correct and will be used in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` is intended to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but is incorrectly implemented. Let's break down why:

   - The loop in `func_2` iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. These calculations do not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The variable `cnt` is incremented by `x // y + (i > 1)`, which does not reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected approach:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

5. **Evaluation of Given Code**: The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem constraints and does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
