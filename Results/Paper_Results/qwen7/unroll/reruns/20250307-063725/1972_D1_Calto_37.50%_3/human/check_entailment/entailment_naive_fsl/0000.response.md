Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main problem statement. `func_1` is a standard Euclidean algorithm implementation for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is not used in the solution. `func_2` seems to be an attempt to solve a different problem, as it does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For the input `(3, 5)`, the expected output is `4`. The valid pairs are:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   - (1, 3)
   - (1, 5)

2. For the input `(10, 8)`, the expected output is `14`. The valid pairs include:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   - (1, 3)
   - (1, 4)
   - (1, 5)
   - (1, 6)
   - (1, 7)
   - (1, 8)
   - (2, 2)
   - (2, 4)
   - (2, 6)
   - (3, 3)
   - (4, 4)
   - (5, 5)

However, the provided program does not generate these results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
