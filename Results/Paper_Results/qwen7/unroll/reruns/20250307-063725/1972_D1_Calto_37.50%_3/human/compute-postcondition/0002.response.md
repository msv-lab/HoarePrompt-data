Output State: `cnt` is the sum of \(\sum_{i=1}^{m-1} \left( \left\lfloor \frac{n - (i^2 - i)}{i^2} \right\rfloor + (i > 1) \right)\).

This means `cnt` is calculated by iterating from `i = 1` to `i = m-1`, computing the value of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n - (i^2 - i)}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) for each `i`, adding 1 if `i > 1`, and summing these values.
