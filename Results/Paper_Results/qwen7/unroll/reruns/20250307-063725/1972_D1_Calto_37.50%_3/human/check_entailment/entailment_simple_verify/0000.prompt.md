You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:

    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is that `a` contains the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
    #
    #The loop implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. Initially, `a` and `b` are positive integers within specified ranges. After the loop completes, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0 because the Euclidean algorithm continues to replace `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of all m and n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    #State: Output State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we compute `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we compute `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is not zero.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of the series where for each i from 1 to m-1, we compute x = n - (i * i - i) and y = i * i, then add x // y + (i > 1) to cnt. The value of cnt is not zero.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main problem statement. `func_1` is a standard Euclidean algorithm implementation for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is not used in the solution. `func_2` seems to be an attempt to solve a different problem, as it does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To verify this, let's consider a few test cases:

1. For the input `(3, 5)`, the expected output is `4`. The valid pairs are:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   - (1, 3)
   - (1, 5)

2. For the input `(10, 8)`, the expected output is `14`. The valid pairs include:
   - (1, 1)
   - (1, 2)
   - (1, 3)
   - (1, 4)
   - (1, 5)
   - (1, 6)
   - (1, 7)
   - (1, 8)
   - (2, 2)
   - (2, 4)
   - (2, 6)
   - (3, 3)
   - (4, 4)
   - (5, 5)

However, the provided program does not generate these results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
