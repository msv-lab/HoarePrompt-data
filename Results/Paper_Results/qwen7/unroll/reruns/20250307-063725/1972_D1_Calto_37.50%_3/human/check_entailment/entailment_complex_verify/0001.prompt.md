You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is that `a` contains the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
    #
    #The loop implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. Initially, `a` and `b` are positive integers within specified ranges. After the loop completes, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` will be 0 because the Euclidean algorithm continues to replace `b` with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` until `b` becomes 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. After the calculation, the function returns the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being set to 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of all m and n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we compute `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we compute `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`. The value of `cnt` is not zero.
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of the series where for each i from 1 to m-1, we compute x = n - (i * i - i) and y = i * i, then add x // y + (i > 1) to cnt. The value of cnt is not zero.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), both constrained to be between 1 and \( 2 \times 10^6 \). If the computed sum \( cnt \) is zero, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns the non-zero sum \( cnt \) which is the result of a series calculation involving \( n \) and \( m \).




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **GCD Calculation**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and will be used in the main logic.

3. **Main Logic**: The function `func_2` is supposed to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem statement requirements. Specifically:
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) but should iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - The variables `x` and `y` are defined in a way that does not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The condition `cnt == 0` and the return value handling do not align with the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Approach**: To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
