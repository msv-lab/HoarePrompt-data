Output State: **`index` is 1; `t` is `data[0]`; `results` is an empty list**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `index` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `index` is still 1, `t` is still `data[0]`, and `results` is an empty list.
