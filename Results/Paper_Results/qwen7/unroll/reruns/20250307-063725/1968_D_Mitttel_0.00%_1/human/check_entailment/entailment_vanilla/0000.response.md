Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes the parameters `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a`.
   - It calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns.
   - It checks for cycles in the permutation to optimize the calculation when the game enters a cycle.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- The function correctly simulates the game for `k` turns.
- It handles cycles efficiently by calculating the score for one cycle and then determining how many complete cycles fit into `k` turns.
- The remainder steps are handled correctly by adding the score for the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores.
- The logic for determining the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function reads input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
- The logic for reading and processing the input is correct.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, it appears that the functions are implemented correctly according to the problem description. The logic for handling cycles and calculating scores is sound, and the overall structure of the program is appropriate for the given problem.
