Postcondition: **The final value of `score` is the sum of elements in the list `a` from the positions specified by the permutation `p` for `k` steps, or until a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, the `score` is the sum of elements from the start of the cycle to the point where the cycle starts, plus the sum of elements for the remaining steps within the cycle. If a cycle is not detected, `score` is updated by adding the sum of elements for each step according to the permutation `p`.**

This postcondition summarizes the behavior of the program after executing the if-else block. It covers both scenarios: when a cycle is detected and when it is not.
