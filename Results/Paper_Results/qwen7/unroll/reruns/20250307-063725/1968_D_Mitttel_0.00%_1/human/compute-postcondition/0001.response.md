Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input using whitespace.**

The code reads a line of input using `input()` and splits it into a list of strings using whitespace (`split()`). The variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged. The new variable `data` is created and contains the split input.
