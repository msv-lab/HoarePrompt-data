t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n; a is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9.
