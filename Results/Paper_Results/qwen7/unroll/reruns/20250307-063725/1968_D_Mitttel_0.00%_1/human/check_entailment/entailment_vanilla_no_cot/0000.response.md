Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in `func_1`. The function `calculate_score` is correctly implemented, but it is not being used properly in `func_1`. Specifically, `func_1` should call `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha and compare their scores. However, the current implementation of `func_1` is incorrect because it calls `calculate_score` only once for Bodya and once for Sasha without considering the game's rules (i.e., the sequence of moves and scores).

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB, k, p, a)
    sasha_score = calculate_score(PS, k, p, a)
    if bodya_score > sasha_score:
        return 'Bodya'
    elif sasha_score > bodya_score:
        return 'Sasha'
    else:
        return 'Draw'

def calculate_score(start_pos, k, p, a):
    current_pos = start_pos
    score = 0
    for step in range(k):
        score += a[current_pos - 1]
        current_pos = p[current_pos - 1]
    return score
```

In this corrected version, `calculate_score` takes the starting position, the number of steps (k), the permutation `p`, and the array `a` as arguments. It calculates the total score for the given number of steps. `func_1` then uses this function to calculate the scores for both Bodya and Sasha and compares them to determine the winner.
