### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program step by step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- The function correctly simulates the game for `k` turns.
- It handles cycles efficiently by calculating the score for one cycle and then determining how many complete cycles fit into `k` turns.
- The remainder steps are handled correctly by adding the score for the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores.
- The logic for determining the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function reads input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
- The logic for reading and processing the input is correct.

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The functions are implemented correctly, and the logic follows the problem description precisely.

### Final Evaluation
