Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating scores for both players. Specifically, the `calculate_score` function only considers the initial path without properly accounting for the possibility of cycles in the permutation. This can lead to incorrect scores, especially in scenarios where the permutation has cycles.

For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  Bodya
  ```

However, the provided solution might not handle this correctly due to the incomplete cycle handling logic. Let's walk through the example:

- Initial positions: Bodya starts at 3, Sasha starts at 2.
- First turn:
  - Bodya: Position 3, Score = 5 (a_3).
  - Sasha: Position 2, Score = 2 (a_2).
- Second turn:
  - Bodya: Position 3, Score = 5 + 5 = 10 (stays at 3).
  - Sasha: Position 1, Score = 2 + 7 = 9 (moves to p_2 = 1).

Final scores:
- Bodya: 10
- Sasha: 9

In this case, Bodya wins, which matches the expected output. However, the provided code might not handle more complex permutations with cycles correctly, leading to potential errors in other cases.

To ensure correctness, the `calculate_score` function needs to fully account for cycles and their impact on the final score. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases correctly.
