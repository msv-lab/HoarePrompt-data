Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; `PB` and `PS` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; `p` is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n; `a` is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change any of the existing variables or their values. Instead, it reassigns the variable `input` to refer to the function `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire standard input as a single string. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `PB`, `PS`, `p`, or `a`.
