Output State: **`remaining_steps` is updated to `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged and is equal to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, and `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The variable `remainder_steps` is assigned the value of `remaining_steps % cycle_length`. This operation calculates the remainder when `remaining_steps` is divided by `cycle_length`. The other variables (`cycle_score`, `cycle_length`, `current_pos`, `cycle_pos`, and the `visited` dictionary) remain unchanged from their initial states.
