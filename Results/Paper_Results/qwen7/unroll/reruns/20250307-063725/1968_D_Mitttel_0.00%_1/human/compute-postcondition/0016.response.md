Output State: **`remaining_steps` is `k - steps - full_cycles * cycle_length`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged and is equal to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, and `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The code calculates `full_cycles` as the integer division of `remaining_steps` by `cycle_length`. This means `remaining_steps` is reduced by `full_cycles * cycle_length`. The other variables (`cycle_score`, `cycle_length`, `current_pos`, `cycle_pos`, and `visited`) remain unchanged.
