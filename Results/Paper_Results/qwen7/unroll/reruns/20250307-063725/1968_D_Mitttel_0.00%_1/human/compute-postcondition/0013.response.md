Output State: `cycle_score` is the sum of elements from the position `cycle_pos` to the position calculated by moving backward by `cycle_length` steps, `cycle_length` is the same as the number of iterations in the loop, `current_pos` is equal to `cycle_pos`, and `cycle_pos` is updated to the new position after all iterations, `visited` dictionary still tracks the visited positions, and `steps` is incremented by `cycle_length`.
