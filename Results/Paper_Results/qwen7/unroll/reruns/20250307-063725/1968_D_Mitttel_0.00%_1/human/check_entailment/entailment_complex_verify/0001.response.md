### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is implemented according to the problem description and handles all aspects of the game simulation accurately. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - The function correctly simulates the game for `k` turns.
   - It optimizes the calculation by detecting cycles in the permutation and handling them appropriately.
   - The score is calculated correctly for both the main sequence and the cycles.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and collects the results.
   - It prints the results for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis and the annotations provided, the program appears to be correct. The logic for handling cycles and calculating scores is sound, and the overall structure of the program is appropriate for the given problem.
