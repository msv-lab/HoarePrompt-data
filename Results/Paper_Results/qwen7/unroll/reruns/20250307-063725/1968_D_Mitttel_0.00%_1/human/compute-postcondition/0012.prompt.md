You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n; a is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        
        PB = int(data[index + 2])
        
        PS = int(data[index + 3])
        
        index += 4
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 4 + 4 * t; `t` is `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: index
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), p (a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n), and a (a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
