Output State: **index** is 4 + 4 * t; **t** is **data[0]**; **results** is a list containing **t** elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop; no changes to **results** or any other variables inside the loop since the loop only prints the elements of **results** without modifying them.
