Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the score for a given starting position using the `calculate_score` function.
   - The `calculate_score` function correctly handles both non-cyclic and cyclic paths.
   - It updates the score by iterating through the permutation `p` for `k` steps or until a cycle is detected.
   - If a cycle is detected, it calculates the score for the remaining steps within the cycle.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**:
   - This function correctly identifies cycles in the permutation and calculates the score accordingly.
   - It uses a `visited` dictionary to detect cycles and accurately computes the score for both complete cycles and any remaining steps.
   - The logic for handling cycles and non-cyclic paths is sound.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input data from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and constructs the necessary lists (`p` and `a`) for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters and collects the results.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given that all functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem statement appropriately, the overall program should work as intended.

Correctness: **True**
