Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for result in results:`. The variables involved here are `result` and `results`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where `t` is `data[0]`.
   - Each element in the list is the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)`.
   - `index` is given as `4 + 4 * t`, but this is not directly related to the loop itself.

3. **Understand the loop execution condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Since `results` contains `t` elements, the loop will execute `t` times.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `results`. We need to ensure that `results` is a list with at least one element for the loop to start executing.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

- `results` must be a list with at least one element.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`results` is a list containing at least one element where each element is the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.**
