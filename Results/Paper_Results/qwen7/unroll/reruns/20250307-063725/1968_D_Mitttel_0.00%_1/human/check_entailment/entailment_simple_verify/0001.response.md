### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `calculate_score`:
1. **Cycle Detection and Handling**:
   - The function correctly identifies cycles in the permutation using a dictionary `visited` to track positions.
   - When a cycle is detected, the function calculates the cycle length and the score for one cycle.
   - It then determines how many complete cycles fit into `k` turns and adds the corresponding score.
   - The remainder steps are handled by iterating through the remaining steps within the cycle.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no cycle is detected, the function simply accumulates the score for each step up to `k`.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Score Calculation**:
   - The function calls `calculate_score` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It correctly compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Input Processing**:
   - The function reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It correctly parses the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are collected and printed.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Function `calculate_score`:
- The function correctly simulates the game for `k` turns.
- It handles cycles efficiently by calculating the score for one cycle and then determining how many complete cycles fit into `k` turns.
- The remainder steps are handled correctly by adding the score for the remaining steps.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function correctly calls `calculate_score` for both players and compares their scores.
- The logic for determining the winner ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw') is correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function reads input correctly and processes multiple test cases.
- It calls `func_1` for each test case and prints the results.
- The logic for reading and processing the input is correct.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, it appears that the functions are implemented correctly according to the problem description. The logic for handling cycles and calculating scores is sound, and the overall structure of the program is appropriate for the given problem.
