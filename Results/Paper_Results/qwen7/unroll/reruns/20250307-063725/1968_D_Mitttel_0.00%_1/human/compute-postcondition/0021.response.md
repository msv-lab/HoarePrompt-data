Output State: `remaining_steps` is updated to `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `current_pos` is updated to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations, and `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`.
