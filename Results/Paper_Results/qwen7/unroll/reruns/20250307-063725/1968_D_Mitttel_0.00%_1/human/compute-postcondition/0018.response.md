Output State: **`remaining_steps` is updated to `remaining_steps % cycle_length`, `cycle_score` remains unchanged, `cycle_length` remains unchanged, `current_pos` remains unchanged and is equal to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations, and `score` is increased by `full_cycles * cycle_score`.**

This means that the `score` variable has been updated by adding `full_cycles * cycle_score` to its current value. All other variables (`remaining_steps`, `cycle_score`, `cycle_length`, `current_pos`, `cycle_pos`, and the `visited` dictionary) remain unchanged from their previous states.
