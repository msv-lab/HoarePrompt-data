Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is responsible for determining the winner based on the calculated scores for Bodya and Sasha. It correctly uses the `calculate_score` function to get the scores for both players and compares them to determine the winner or if there is a draw. The logic here is sound and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function `calculate_score`**: This function accurately calculates the score for a given starting position by following the rules of the game. It handles both the case where a cycle is detected in the permutation and the case where no cycle is detected. The implementation correctly accounts for the number of complete cycles and the remaining steps within the cycle, ensuring the total score is calculated accurately.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from standard input, processes each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case. It correctly handles the parsing of input data and ensures that the results are printed in the required format. There are no issues with the logic in this function.

Given that all three functions work together to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
