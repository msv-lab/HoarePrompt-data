Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, PB and PS are integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n, and p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, and a is a list of n integers where each element is in the range 1 to 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a):
    bodya_score = calculate_score(PB)

    if (bodya_score > sasha_score) :
        return 'Bodya'

        else :
            return 'Draw'
            #The program returns 'Draw'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n, k, PB, PS, p, and a. It calculates scores for two individuals, Bodya and Sasha, based on their respective positions (PB and PS) in the permutation list p and the corresponding values in the list a. If Bodya's score is higher, the function returns 'Bodya'. If Sasha's score is higher, the function returns 'Sasha'. If both scores are equal, the function returns 'Draw'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start_pos is an integer such that 1 <= start_pos <= n, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5, a is a list of integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.

        if current_pos in visited:
            cycle_start = visited[current_pos]
            break

    #State: Output State: The final value of `score` will be the sum of elements in the list `a` from the positions specified by the permutation `p` for `k` steps, or until a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, the `score` will be the sum of elements from the start of the cycle to the point where the cycle starts, plus the sum of elements for the remaining steps within the cycle.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates up to `k` times, updating the `current_pos` based on the permutation `p` and accumulating the score by adding the value at `a[current_pos - 1]` to `score`. If the `current_pos` has been visited before (indicating a cycle), the loop breaks and the current `score` is returned. Otherwise, it continues to update the `visited` dictionary and increment the `steps` counter.
    if (cycle_start != -1) :
        cycle_length = steps - cycle_start
        cycle_score = 0
        cycle_pos = current_pos

            cycle_pos = p[cycle_pos - 1]
            
        #State: Output State: `cycle_score` is the sum of elements from `cycle_pos - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_length` is the same as the number of iterations in the loop, `current_pos` remains unchanged and is equal to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, and `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations. The `steps` counter is incremented by `cycle_length`.
        remaining_steps = k - steps
        full_cycles = remaining_steps // cycle_length
        remainder_steps = remaining_steps % cycle_length
        score += full_cycles * cycle_score

    #State: The final value of `score` is the sum of elements in the list `a` from the positions specified by the permutation `p` for `k` steps, or until a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, the `score` is the sum of elements from the start of the cycle to the point where the cycle starts, plus the sum of elements for the remaining steps within the cycle. If a cycle is not detected, `score` is updated by adding the sum of elements for each step according to the permutation `p`.
    return score
    #The program returns the score which is the sum of elements in the list 'a' from the positions specified by the permutation 'p' for 'k' steps, or until a cycle is detected. If a cycle is detected, the score is the sum of elements from the start of the cycle to the point where the cycle starts, plus the sum of elements for the remaining steps within the cycle. If a cycle is not detected, the score is updated by adding the sum of elements for each step according to the permutation 'p'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `calculate_score` accepts a starting position `start_pos` and computes a score by summing elements in the list `a` based on the permutation `p` for `k` steps. If a cycle is detected in the permutation sequence, the score includes the sum of elements from the start of the cycle to the point where the cycle starts, plus the sum of elements for the remaining steps within the cycle. If no cycle is detected, the score is the cumulative sum of elements for each step according to the permutation `p`. The function returns the final computed score.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9; PB and PS are positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n; p is a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n; a is a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9.

        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 4 + 4 * t; `t` is `data[0]`; `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the result of `func_1(n, k, PB, PS, p, a)` for each iteration of the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: index
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data from standard input, processes it in multiple iterations based on the number of test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each iteration to compute a result. It then stores these results in a list and prints each result. The function does not return any value.
