Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the winner of a game between Bodya and Sasha based on their starting positions in a permutation and the values in an array. Both players take turns moving through the permutation and accumulate scores based on the values at their current positions.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the scores for Bodya and Sasha using the `calculate_score` function. It then compares the scores and returns the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').
   - **calculate_score**: This function calculates the score for a given starting position by iterating through the permutation for `k` steps, accounting for cycles in the permutation. It correctly handles both the case where a cycle is detected and where no cycle is detected.
   - **func_2**: This function reads input data, processes it for each test case, and calls `func_1` to determine the winner for each test case. It then prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **func_1**: The logic for comparing scores and returning the appropriate result is correct.
   - **calculate_score**: The logic for handling cycles and calculating scores is correct. The function correctly accounts for both scenarios: when a cycle is detected and when no cycle is detected.
   - **func_2**: The function correctly reads input, processes it, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The results are stored and printed correctly.

Given that all functions are implemented correctly and handle the problem requirements accurately, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
