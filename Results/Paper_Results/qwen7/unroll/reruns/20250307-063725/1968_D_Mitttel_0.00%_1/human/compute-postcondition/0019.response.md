Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop and does not require an initial value since its purpose is just to iterate over the specified range.
   - `remainder_steps`: This variable determines how many times the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the Initial State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will run `remainder_steps` times. Therefore, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The loop does not directly modify `remainder_steps`, but rather uses it as a counter for the number of iterations. Hence, no adjustment is needed for `remainder_steps` itself, but we need to ensure it is valid for the loop to execute.
   - Other variables like `cycle_score`, `cycle_length`, `current_pos`, `cycle_pos`, `visited`, and `score` are either unchanged or updated within the loop body, so their initial states do not affect whether the loop can execute.

3. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - Since the loop will run `remainder_steps` times, `remainder_steps` must be greater than 0.
   - No other adjustments are necessary for the other variables mentioned.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`remainder_steps` must be greater than 0**
