Functionality: **The function accepts parameters t (a positive integer representing the number of test cases), n and k (positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9), PB and PS (positive integers such that 1 ≤ PB, PS ≤ n), p (a list of n integers representing the permutation, where each integer is a distinct value from 1 to n), and a (a list of n integers representing the array a, where each integer is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9). The function does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the given information.**
