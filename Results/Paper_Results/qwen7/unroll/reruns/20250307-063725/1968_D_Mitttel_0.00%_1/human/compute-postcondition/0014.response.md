Output State: `cycle_score` is the sum of elements from `cycle_pos - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_length` is the same as the number of iterations in the loop, `current_pos` remains unchanged and is equal to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, and `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations. The `steps` counter is incremented by `cycle_length`.
