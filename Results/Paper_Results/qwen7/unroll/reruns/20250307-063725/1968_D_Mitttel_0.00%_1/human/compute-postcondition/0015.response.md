Output State: **`remaining_steps` is `k - steps`, `cycle_score` is the sum of elements from `cycle_pos - cycle_length` to `cycle_pos - 1`, `cycle_length` is the same as the number of iterations in the loop, `current_pos` remains unchanged and is equal to `cycle_pos`, `cycle_pos` is updated to the position after completing all iterations in the loop, and `visited` dictionary includes all positions visited during the loop iterations.**

Explanation: The line `remaining_steps = k - steps` calculates the remaining steps needed to reach the target by subtracting the current steps (`steps`) from the total steps (`k`). This calculation updates the value of `remaining_steps`. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by this line of code.
