You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program:
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, it appends a specific character followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52, it appends 'a', a specific character, and 'z'. If `n` is exactly 27, it sets `word` to 'aay'. Otherwise, it appends 'aa' followed by a specific character. The function prints the constructed string `word` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of strings corresponding to the given conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `24`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to `24` is `"aav"`. However, the program generates `"aaz"` instead. This happens because the logic in the program does not correctly account for the lexicographical order when constructing the word.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:
- When `n > 52`, the program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- When `n <= 52`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

For `n = 24`, the correct construction should be `"aav"` because `24 - 3 = 21`, and the 21st letter in the alphabet is `'v'`. However, the program incorrectly constructs it as `"aaz"`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs the word in a way that respects the lexicographical order. A corrected approach would involve more detailed logic to ensure that the constructed word is always the lexicographically smallest possible.
