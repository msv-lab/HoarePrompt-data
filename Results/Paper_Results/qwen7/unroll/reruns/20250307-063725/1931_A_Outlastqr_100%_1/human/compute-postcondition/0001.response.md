Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a non-negative integer value. However, the exact value of `int(input())` is not known until runtime. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided during the execution of the program will result in a valid loop condition.

3. **Consider the given constraints**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 78\).

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value provided during the execution of the program will satisfy the condition `3 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 78`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input value should be within the specified range for the loop to execute correctly.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78, the input value must be an integer in the range 3 to 78 inclusive**.
