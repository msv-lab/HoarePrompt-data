Reasoning:
- The program correctly handles different ranges of `n` values and constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.
- For `n > 52`, the word is constructed as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`, which ensures the smallest possible word since `alphabet[n - 53]` will be the smallest possible character after 'z'.
- For `28 <= n <= 52`, the word is constructed as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`, ensuring the smallest possible word with 'a' as the second character.
- For `n == 27`, the word is set to `'aay'`, which is the smallest possible word for this value.
- For `n <= 26`, the word is constructed as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`, ensuring the smallest possible word with 'aa' as the prefix and the smallest possible character after 'a'.

Given these constructions, the program should produce the lexicographically smallest words for each test case as specified in the examples.

Correctness: **True**
