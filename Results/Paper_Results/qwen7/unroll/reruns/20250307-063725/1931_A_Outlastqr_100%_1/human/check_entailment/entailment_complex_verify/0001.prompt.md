You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nikita had a word consisting of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters. The letters
in the Latin alphabet are numbered from 1 to 26 , where the letter "a" has the
index 1 , and the letter "z" has the index 26 .

He encoded this word as the sum of the positions of all the characters in the
alphabet. For example, the word "cat" he would encode as the integer 3 + 1 +
20 = 24 , because the letter "c" has the index 3 in the alphabet, the letter
"a" has the index 1 , and the letter "t" has the index 20 .

However, this encoding turned out to be ambiguous! For example, when encoding
the word "ava", the integer 1 + 22 + 1 = 24 is also obtained.

Determine the lexicographically smallest word of 3 letters that could have
been encoded.

A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if and only if one of
the following holds:

  * a is a prefix of b , but a \ne b ;
  * in the first position where a and b differ, the string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

This is followed by the descriptions of the test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \le n \le
78 ) — the encoded word.

Output

For each test case, output the lexicographically smallest three-letter word
that could have been encoded on a separate line.

Example

Input

    5
    
    24
    
    70
    
    3
    
    55
    
    48

Output

    aav
    rzz
    aaa
    czz
    auz

- Program: 
import string

def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)



- Annotated Code: 
import string

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        word = ''
        
        if n > 52:
            word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'
        elif n > 27:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        
        print(word)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n varies based on user input during each iteration of the loop, word is a string constructed according to the conditions within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, it appends a specific character followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52, it appends 'a', a specific character, and 'z'. If `n` is exactly 27, it sets `word` to 'aay'. Otherwise, it appends 'aa' followed by a specific character. The function prints the constructed string `word` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of strings corresponding to the given conditions.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - For `n > 52`, it constructs the word by adding the character at index `n - 53` (since indices start from 0) followed by 'zz'. This logic is correct.
   - For `27 < n <= 52`, it constructs the word by adding 'a', the character at index `n - 28`, and 'z'. This logic is correct.
   - For `n == 27`, it sets the word to 'aay'. This is a specific case and should be handled correctly.
   - For `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This logic is correct.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed words are lexicographically smallest by using the correct indices and appending appropriate characters. The logic for handling different ranges of `n` is sound and ensures the smallest possible word for each case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `n == 27` and `n <= 26` appropriately. These cases are correctly identified and handled with the right characters.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest word for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case based on the provided encoding rules.

Correctness: **True**
