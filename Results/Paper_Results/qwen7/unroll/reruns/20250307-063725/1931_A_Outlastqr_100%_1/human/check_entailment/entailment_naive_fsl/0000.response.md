Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to generate the lexicographically smallest word for certain encoded values. 

For example, consider the encoded value `24`. According to the problem description, the lexicographically smallest word that encodes to `24` is `"aav"`. However, the program generates `"aaz"` instead. This happens because the logic in the program does not correctly account for the lexicographical order when constructing the word.

Here's a breakdown of the issue:
- When `n > 52`, the program constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
- When `n <= 52`, it constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.

For `n = 24`, the correct construction should be `"aav"` because `24 - 3 = 21`, and the 21st letter in the alphabet is `'v'`. However, the program incorrectly constructs it as `"aaz"`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it constructs the word in a way that respects the lexicographical order. A corrected approach would involve more detailed logic to ensure that the constructed word is always the lexicographically smallest possible.
