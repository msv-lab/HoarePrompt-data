Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and constructs a string `word` based on the value of `n`. If `n` is greater than 52, it appends a specific character followed by 'zz'. If `n` is between 28 and 52, it appends 'a', a specific character, and 'z'. If `n` is exactly 27, it sets `word` to 'aay'. Otherwise, it appends 'aa' followed by a specific character. The function prints the constructed string `word` for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of strings corresponding to the given conditions.**
