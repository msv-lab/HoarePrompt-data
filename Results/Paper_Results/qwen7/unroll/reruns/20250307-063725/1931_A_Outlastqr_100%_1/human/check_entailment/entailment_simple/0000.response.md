### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the encoded integer `n`.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than 52, which corresponds to the highest possible sum for a 3-letter word starting with 'z'. If so, it constructs the word as `'zz'` plus the appropriate character from the alphabet.
   - If `n` is between 28 and 52, it constructs the word as `'a'` plus the appropriate character from the alphabet, followed by `'z'`.
   - If `n` is 27, it specifically constructs the word as `'aay'`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the word as `'aa'` plus the appropriate character from the alphabet.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The logic ensures that the word is constructed in a way that maintains lexicographical order. For instance, when `n` is 27, the word `'aay'` is the smallest possible word that can be encoded as 27.
   - When `n` is between 28 and 52, the word is constructed to ensure that it starts with `'a'` and ends with `'z'`, which is the smallest possible combination for those sums.
   - For other values of `n`, the word is constructed to start with `'aa'` and end with the appropriate character, ensuring it is lexicographically minimal.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like `n = 27` and `n > 52` correctly, ensuring that the constructed words are lexicographically minimal.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word that could have been encoded for each test case.
