Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 78 inclusive. Based on these values, the function returns a specific output without explicitly being passed these parameters in the function definition.**
