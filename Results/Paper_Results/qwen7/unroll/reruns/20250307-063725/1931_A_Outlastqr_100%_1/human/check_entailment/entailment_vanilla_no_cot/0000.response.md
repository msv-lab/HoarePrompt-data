Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases for encoding a 3-letter word into a given integer `n`. Specifically, there are issues with how the word is constructed for different ranges of `n`:

1. **Case `n > 52`:**
   - The current implementation constructs the word as `alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'`.
   - This approach fails to consider the correct placement of the first character. For instance, if `n = 53`, the correct word should be "azz" instead of "bzz".

2. **Case `n > 27`:**
   - The current implementation constructs the word as `'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'`.
   - This works for some values but fails for others. For example, if `n = 28`, the correct word should be "azz" instead of "azz".

3. **Case `n == 27`:**
   - The current implementation sets the word to `'aay'`.
   - This is correct but needs to be handled more generally.

4. **Case `n <= 26`:**
   - The current implementation constructs the word as `'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]`.
   - This is mostly correct but can be simplified and generalized.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the word construction logic correctly handles all possible values of `n` and maintains lexicographical order. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    alphabet = string.ascii_lowercase
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        word = ''
        if n >= 53:
            word += alphabet[(n - 53) % 26] + 'zz'
        elif n >= 28:
            word += 'a' + alphabet[(n - 27) % 26] + 'z'
        elif n == 27:
            word = 'aay'
        else:
            word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]
        print(word)
```

This revised function ensures that the word is constructed correctly for all values of `n` within the specified range.
