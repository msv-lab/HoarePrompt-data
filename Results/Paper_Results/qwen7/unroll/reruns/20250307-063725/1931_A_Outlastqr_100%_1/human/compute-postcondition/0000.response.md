Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, alphabet is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 78.**

The code initializes the `alphabet` variable with the lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z'. This does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the range 1 to 100, and `n` remains an integer within the range 3 to 78.
