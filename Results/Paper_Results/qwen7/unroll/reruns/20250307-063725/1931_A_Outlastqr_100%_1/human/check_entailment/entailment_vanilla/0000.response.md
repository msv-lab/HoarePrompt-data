### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - For `n > 52`, it constructs the word by adding the character at index `n - 53` (since indices start from 0) followed by 'zz'. This logic is correct.
   - For `27 < n <= 52`, it constructs the word by adding 'a', the character at index `n - 28`, and 'z'. This logic is correct.
   - For `n == 27`, it sets the word to 'aay'. This is a specific case and should be handled correctly.
   - For `n <= 26`, it constructs the word by adding 'aa' followed by the character at index `n - 3`. This logic is correct.

3. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The program ensures that the constructed words are lexicographically smallest by using the correct indices and appending appropriate characters. The logic for handling different ranges of `n` is sound and ensures the smallest possible word for each case.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as `n == 27` and `n <= 26` appropriately. These cases are correctly identified and handled with the right characters.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the lexicographically smallest word for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically smallest word for each test case based on the provided encoding rules.
