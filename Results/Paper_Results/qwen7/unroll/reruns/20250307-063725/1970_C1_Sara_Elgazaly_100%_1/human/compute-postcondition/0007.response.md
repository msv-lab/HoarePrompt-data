Output State: **`one` is True, `z` is equal to `tmp`, `x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `lst` is a defaultdict where for each key a (where 1 ≤ a ≤ n), the value is a list containing all b such that there was an input (a, b) in the range of x-1 iterations, `rev` is a defaultdict where for each key b (where 1 ≤ b ≤ n), the value is a list containing all a such that there was an input (a, b) in the range of x-1 iterations.**

Explanation: The line `one = True` simply assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `one`. All other variables retain their initial states as described in the initial state.
