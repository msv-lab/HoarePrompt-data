Output State: **`two` is `True`, `one` will be toggled between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations in the loop, `tmp` is equal to `z`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `z` to `tmp`. The values of `two` and `one` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, `two` remains `True`, `one` continues to toggle between `True` and `False` based on the number of iterations in the loop, and `tmp` now holds the value of `z`.
