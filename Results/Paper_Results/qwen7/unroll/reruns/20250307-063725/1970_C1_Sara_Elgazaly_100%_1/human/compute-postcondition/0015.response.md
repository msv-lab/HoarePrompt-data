Based on the initial state provided:

- `two` is `False`.
- `one` is toggled between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations in the loop.
- `tmp` is equal to an element from the list `rev[tmp]` after all iterations.

From the explanation:
- `two` starts as `False` and gets toggled with each iteration, so after all iterations, it remains `False`.
- `one` depends on the number of iterations: if the number of iterations is odd, `one` will be `False`; if even, `one` will be `True`.
- `tmp` holds the last element from the list `rev[tmp]` after the loop finishes executing.

Given the print statement:
```python
print('Hermione' if two and one else 'Ron')
```

Since `two` is `False`, the condition `two and one` evaluates to `False`. Therefore, the print statement will output `'Ron'`.

Output: **Ron**
