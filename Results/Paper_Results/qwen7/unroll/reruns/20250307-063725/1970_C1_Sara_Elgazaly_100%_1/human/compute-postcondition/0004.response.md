Output State: **x is an integer input from the user, y is an integer input from the user, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict where for each key a (where 1 ≤ a ≤ n), the value is a list containing all b such that there was an input (a, b) in the range of x-1 iterations; `rev` is a defaultdict where for each key b (where 1 ≤ b ≤ n), the value is a list containing all a such that there was an input (a, b) in the range of x-1 iterations.**
