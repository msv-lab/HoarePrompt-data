Output State: **`x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists; `rev` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

The code initializes a new defaultdict named `rev` where all values are lists. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `lst`). Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new variable `rev` with its default properties.
