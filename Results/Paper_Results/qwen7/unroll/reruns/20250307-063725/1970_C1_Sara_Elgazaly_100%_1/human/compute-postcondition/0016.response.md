Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It verifies that n is an integer within the range 2 to 2Ã—10^5, t is an integer equal to 1, u and v are integers within the range 1 to n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 within the range 1 to n. The function then returns whether these conditions are met.**
