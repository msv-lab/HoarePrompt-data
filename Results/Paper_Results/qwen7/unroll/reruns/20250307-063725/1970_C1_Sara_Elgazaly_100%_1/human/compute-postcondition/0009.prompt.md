Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `one` is True, `z` is equal to `tmp`, `x` is an integer input from the user, `y` is an integer input from the user, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer u_1 such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `lst` is a defaultdict where for each key a (where 1 ≤ a ≤ n), the value is a list containing all b such that there was an input (a, b) in the range of x-1 iterations, `rev` is a defaultdict where for each key b (where 1 ≤ b ≤ n), the value is a list containing all a such that there was an input (a, b) in the range of x-1 iterations.
Code of the loop:
while lst[tmp] != []:
    one = not one
    tmp = lst[tmp].pop()



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
