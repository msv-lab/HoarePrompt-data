Output State: **`two` is `True`, `one` will be toggled between `True` and `False` depending on the number of iterations in the loop, `tmp` will be set to the last element of the list corresponding to its current value in `lst` until `lst[tmp]` becomes empty.**

The code simply assigns `True` to the variable `two`. This does not affect the values of `one` or `tmp`. Therefore, the state of `one` remains as it was initially described, and `tmp` also remains as described.
