Output State: `two` is `False`, `one` is toggled based on the number of iterations, `tmp` is the last element popped from `rev[tmp]` when the loop exits.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `rev[tmp]` is not empty. Inside the loop, `two` is toggled with each iteration (`two = not two`). The value of `tmp` is updated to the last element in the list `rev[tmp]` using `.pop()`, which removes and returns the last item. Therefore, once the loop exits, `two` will be `False` (assuming it started as `True` and was toggled an odd number of times), `one` will be toggled based on the number of iterations (odd or even), and `tmp` will be the last element from the list it was popped from when the condition `rev[tmp] != []` becomes false.
