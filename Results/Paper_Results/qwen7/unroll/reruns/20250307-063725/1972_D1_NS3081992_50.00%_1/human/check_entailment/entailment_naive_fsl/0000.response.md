Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any logic to solve this specific problem. Instead, they appear to be utility functions for various operations like reading input, performing GCD calculations, etc., but not the core logic to solve the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\), the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\). The program does not compute these pairs or provide the correct count of 3.

Since the program does not implement the required logic, it cannot be considered correct.
