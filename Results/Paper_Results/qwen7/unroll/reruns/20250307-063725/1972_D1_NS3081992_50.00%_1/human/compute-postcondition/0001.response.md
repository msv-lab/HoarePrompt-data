Output State: **t lines of integers, each generated by func_15().**

Explanation: The loop runs `func_10()` times, and in each iteration, it writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output followed by a newline character. Since the exact behavior of `func_10()` and `func_15()` is not specified, we can only say that the output will consist of `func_10()` lines, with each line containing an integer produced by `func_15()`.
