Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed, an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`. The function returns 1 in Case_1, and in Case_2, it returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`.**
