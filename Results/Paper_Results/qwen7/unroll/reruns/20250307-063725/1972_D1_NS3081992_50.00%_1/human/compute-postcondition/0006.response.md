Output State: **The program returns the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of n + i, minus 1.**

This means the program calculates the sum of the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for each \(i\) from 1 up to the largest integer not greater than the square root of \(n + i\). After calculating this sum, it subtracts 1 from the result before returning it.
