Reasoning:
- The main function `func_16` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `func_10()`, which reads an integer from standard input.
- It then processes each test case by calling `func_15()` for each test case. `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\) as described in the problem statement.
- The function `func_15()` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) by iterating through possible values of \(i\) and calculating \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
- The function `func_15()` does not explicitly check the conditions for \(a\) and \(b\) but relies on the problem constraints that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Given the problem constraints and the implementation of `func_15()`, it appears that the function correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case.
- The output is written to standard output using `sys.stdout.write`, which is correct for the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
