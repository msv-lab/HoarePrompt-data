Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`.
   - The only variable in the loop head is `func_10()`, which returns an integer value.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since `range(x)` generates numbers from 0 to x-1).
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a non-zero integer.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a non-zero integer.
   - Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `func_10()` presumably uses `t` or some derived value from `t` to determine its return value, we need to ensure that `t` is within the valid range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure that `func_10()` returns a non-zero integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
