### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_16`), but most of these functions are not used in solving the problem.
   - The function `func_15` is the only one that seems relevant to the problem. It calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific logic.
   - The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

3. **Relevant Function Analysis**:
   - `func_15`:
     - It reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0.
     - It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
     - It returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not directly solve the problem. Instead, it seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs, but it uses a heuristic approach that does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition for each pair.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct solution would involve iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The given code does not implement this logic correctly.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides detailed states and transitions of the program, which helps in understanding the flow and logic of the program.
   - The function `func_15` is indeed the core function responsible for counting valid pairs. However, the logic inside `func_15` is flawed and does not correctly implement the required condition.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic in `func_15` is incorrect and does not satisfy the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
