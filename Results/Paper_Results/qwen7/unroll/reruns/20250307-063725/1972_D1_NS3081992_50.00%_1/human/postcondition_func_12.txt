The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both constrained within specific ranges. Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)` or recursively calls itself with parameters `(b, a % b)`. After the recursive call, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of the recursive call. The function ultimately provides a tuple of three integers that satisfy certain mathematical properties related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.
