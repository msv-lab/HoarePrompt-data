Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve a specific problem involving pairs of integers (a, b) under certain conditions.
- The core logic of the solution is implemented in `func_15`, which calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m.
- `func_15` iterates through possible values of `i` and uses the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` to count the number of valid pairs.
- The main function `func_16` correctly reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads n and m, and prints the result of `func_15`.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the functions `func_15` and `func_16` appear to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The logic in `func_15` matches the required conditions and the main function `func_16` handles the input and output correctly.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
