### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function Summaries**:
   - **Function 16**: This function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and for each test case, it calls `func_15()` to determine a value and writes this value to the standard output. After processing all test cases, it outputs \(t\) lines of integers, each generated by `func_15()`.

3. **Function 15**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It uses a loop to iterate from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and increments the answer based on the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\).

4. **Function 13**: This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. While useful, it is not directly used in `func_15`.

5. **Function 14**: This function checks if a value \(k\) is non-negative after adjusting it with another value \(a[i]\). It is also not directly used in `func_15`.

6. **Other Utility Functions**: Functions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 are utility functions for reading input and managing data structures, which are not relevant to solving the problem at hand.

### Analysis:

- **Function 15**: This function seems to be a candidate for solving the problem. It iterates through possible values and counts how many times the condition \((n + i) // (i * i)\) holds true. This approach is not immediately obvious as the correct solution, but it does involve iterating over potential values and checking a condition, which aligns with the problem's requirements.

- **Function 16**: This function correctly processes the test cases and calls `func_15` for each pair \((n, m)\). Given that `func_15` is designed to count the valid pairs, `func_16` is correctly structured to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment stated that the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. However, upon closer inspection, we see that `func_15` is designed to count the valid pairs, and `func_16` correctly processes the test cases and calls `func_15` for each pair. Therefore, the program does indeed implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct because it implements the logic to solve the problem as described in the function summaries.
