Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to determine a value and writes this value to the standard output. After processing all test cases, it outputs t lines of integers, each generated by `func_15()`.**
