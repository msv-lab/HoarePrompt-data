Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions defined in the code are not relevant to solving the given problem. Functions like `func_12`, `func_13`, `func_14`, and others do not contribute to solving the problem at hand.

2. **Relevant Function**: The function `func_15` is the only one that attempts to solve the problem, but it is incorrect. It does not properly account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic in `func_15` is flawed. It calculates the number of pairs `(a, b)` where `a * b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, which simplifies to checking if `a` is a multiple of `gcd(a, b)`. However, this does not fully capture the required condition.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def solve(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def main():
    t = func_10()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = func_2()
        print(solve(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This solution iterates through all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the given condition using the `gcd` function from the `math` module. This approach ensures that the correct count of valid pairs is calculated.
