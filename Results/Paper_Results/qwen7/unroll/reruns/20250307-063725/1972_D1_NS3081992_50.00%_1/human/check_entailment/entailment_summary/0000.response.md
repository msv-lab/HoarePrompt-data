### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions provided correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The problem requires reading multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
   - The provided functions `func_10()` and `func_8(rows)` seem appropriate for reading the number of test cases and the test cases themselves, respectively.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the function `func_15()` is called.
   - `func_15()` calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of \(n + i\), minus 1.
   - This calculation appears to be a part of the solution, but let's verify if it correctly addresses the problem statement.

3. **Problem Statement Analysis:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided function `func_15()` does not seem to directly address the problem statement. Instead, it calculates a sum involving \(n\) and \(i\), which does not align with the required conditions.

4. **Correct Solution Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided `func_15()` function does not perform this check and instead uses a different formula.

Given the mismatch between the provided functions and the problem requirements, the program as written does not correctly solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The program is **incorrect** because the function `func_15()` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: False**
