You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating the processing status of nodes, an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` to store results. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it recursively processes nodes and updates the `rank` list based on the minimum values found, ultimately returning `rank[da - 1] + 1`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\).

    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, and g, where y, x, and g are the results of calling func_13(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both constrained within specific ranges. Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)` or recursively calls itself with parameters `(b, a % b)`. After the recursive call, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of the recursive call. The function ultimately provides a tuple of three integers that satisfy certain mathematical properties related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, adjusting `k` based on the difference between each element and `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the product of the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    #The program returns the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of n + i, minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of \(n + i\), minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: t lines of integers, each generated by func_15().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to determine a value and writes this value to the standard output. After processing all test cases, it outputs t lines of integers, each generated by `func_15()`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several utility functions (`func_1` to `func_16`), but most of these functions are not used in solving the problem.
   - The function `func_15` is the only one that seems relevant to the problem. It calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific logic.
   - The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

3. **Relevant Function Analysis**:
   - `func_15`:
     - It reads \(n\) and \(m\) using `func_7`.
     - It initializes `ans` to 0.
     - It iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\) and increments `ans` by \((n + i) // (i * i)\).
     - It returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Logic Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not directly solve the problem. Instead, it seems to be an attempt to count the number of valid pairs, but it uses a heuristic approach that does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition for each pair.

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct solution would involve iterating over all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The given code does not implement this logic correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
