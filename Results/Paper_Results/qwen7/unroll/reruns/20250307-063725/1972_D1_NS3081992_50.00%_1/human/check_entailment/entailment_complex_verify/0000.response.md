### Reasoning:

The original assessment states that the provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program contains utility functions for reading input, performing GCD calculations, etc., but lacks the core logic to solve the problem. Let's analyze the annotated code and the problem requirements more closely.

#### Core Problem Requirements:
- Calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
  - \(1 \le a \le n\)
  - \(1 \le b \le m\)
  - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Analysis of Functions:
1. **Function 16 (`func_16`)**:
   - This function processes each test case by calling `func_15` and writing the result to standard output.
   - `func_15` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

2. **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
   - This function is intended to solve the core problem.
   - The logic inside `func_15` does not match the problem requirements. It calculates a sum involving \(n\) and \(i\) without considering the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Utility Functions**:
   - Utility functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc., are correctly implemented for reading input and performing basic operations.
   - However, none of these functions directly solve the core problem.

Given the above analysis, the program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as stated. The `func_15` function, which is supposed to be the core solver, does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.
