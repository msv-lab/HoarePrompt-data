Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_5()` are defined in its signature, so there is no direct information about the input or the context in which this function is called.

    #The program returns a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a space-separated string of integers from the standard input, converts each integer in the string to its corresponding numeric value, and returns a list of these integers.

It generates a list of length `rows`, where each element is the result of calling another function `func_7()` for each test case. The final state of the program is that it returns this list.

#Function 9:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the user input as a string.

#Function 10:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function signature are provided in the given code snippet. The function does not take any parameters and presumably reads input from stdin, but no specific input format or variable names are defined within the function itself.
def func_10():

#Function 12:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of length equal to the maximum key in d, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed; da is an integer representing a key in the dictionary d; rank is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in d, used to store the results of the function calls.
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if (len(d[da]) == 1) :

    #State: Postcondition: `tmp` is 1000000000, `d` is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, `processing` is a list of length equal to the maximum key in `d`, containing only 0s and 1s indicating whether a node has been processed, `da` is an integer representing a key in the dictionary `d`, `rank` is a list of integers with the same length as the maximum key in `d`, used to store the results of the function calls, and the length of `d[da]` is not equal to 1.

    #State: `tmp` is updated to the minimum value returned by `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for all `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0. The `processing` list is reset to its original state after each iteration, meaning it will end up with all 0s. The `rank` list remains unchanged.
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`, which is `tmp + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating the processing status of nodes, an integer `da` representing a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` to store results. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it recursively processes nodes and updates the `rank` list based on the minimum values found, ultimately returning `rank[da - 1] + 1`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\).
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns x which is 1, y which is 0, and a which is within the range of 1 to n.
    #State: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\)
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, and g, where y, x, and g are the results of calling func_13(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, both constrained within specific ranges. Depending on the value of `b`, it either directly returns a tuple `(1, 0, a)` or recursively calls itself with parameters `(b, a % b)`. After the recursive call, it returns a tuple `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of the recursive call. The function ultimately provides a tuple of three integers that satisfy certain mathematical properties related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n and 0 <= m, and k is an integer.

    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is at least m, and k is the original value minus the total difference between each a[i] less than m and m.

        #The program returns 1
    #State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is at least m, and k is the original value minus the total difference between each a[i] less than m and m, and k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a`, adjusting `k` based on the difference between each element and `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the product of the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.

    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n + i`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of n + i, minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of \(n + i\), minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: t lines of integers, each generated by func_15().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it calls `func_15()` to determine a value and writes this value to the standard output. After processing all test cases, it outputs t lines of integers, each generated by `func_15()`.
