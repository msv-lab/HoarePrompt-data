### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down the key points:

1. **Problem Requirements**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - **Reading Input**: Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, and `func_4` are used to read input from standard input. These functions are correct and necessary for handling the input.
   - **GCD Calculation**: Function `func_13` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This function is correct and useful, but it is not used in the context of solving the main problem.
   - **Other Utility Functions**: Functions like `func_5`, `func_6`, `func_7`, `func_8`, `func_9`, `func_10`, `func_11`, `func_12`, and `func_14` are utility functions that do not contribute to solving the main problem.

3. **Main Function (`func_15`)**: The function `func_15` does not implement the required logic. It calculates a value based on the input but does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Specifically, it computes \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for \(i\) from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of \(n + i\), and then subtracts 1. This calculation is unrelated to the problem requirements.

4. **Main Execution (`func_16`)**: The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_15` for each test case. Since `func_15` does not implement the required logic, the output will be incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the program does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the logic needed to solve the given problem.
