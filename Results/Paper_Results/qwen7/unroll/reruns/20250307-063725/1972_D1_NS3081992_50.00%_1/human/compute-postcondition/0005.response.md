Output State: **The value of `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n + i`.**

To break it down further:
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the value of `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
- This continues until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`.
- Therefore, the final value of `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` starting from 1 up to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i` is still less than or equal to `n + i`.

This calculation depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but the process described above will yield the final value of `ans` after the loop completes.
