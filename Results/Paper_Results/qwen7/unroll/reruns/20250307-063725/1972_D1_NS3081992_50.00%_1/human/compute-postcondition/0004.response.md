Output State: The value of `ans` will be the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 1 up to the largest integer such that `i * i` does not exceed `n + i`.

To break it down further:
- The loop starts with `i = 1`.
- For each iteration, `ans` is incremented by the integer division of `(n + i)` by `i * i`.
- The loop continues as long as `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- Once `i * i` exceeds `n + i`, the loop terminates.

The exact value of `ans` depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but it will always be the sum of the specified expression for all valid `i` values.
