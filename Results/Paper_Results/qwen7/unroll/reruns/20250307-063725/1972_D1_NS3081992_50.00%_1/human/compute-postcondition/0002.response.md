Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) are provided. The sum of n and m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. For each test case, the function determines and returns whether the conditions for n and m are met.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing values for t, n, and m, and checks if these values meet the specified constraints. It then returns a result indicating if the conditions are satisfied for each test case.
