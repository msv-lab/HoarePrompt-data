Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `check` together correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are given a tree with `n` vertices.
   - We need to remove `k` edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least `x`.
   - We need to find the maximum value of `x`.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x` such that removing `k` edges results in connected components of size at least `x`.
   - The binary search is performed between `l = 1` and `r = n // k`, which makes sense because the smallest possible component size is 1 and the largest possible component size is `n // k`.

3. **Analysis of `check`:**
   - `check` is called with a potential value of `x` (denoted as `A`).
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and count the number of connected components with at least `A` vertices.
   - The function returns `True` if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that all remaining components have at least `A` vertices, and `False` otherwise.

4. **Combining `func_1` and `check`:**
   - `func_1` uses `check` to verify if a given `x` (mid value in the binary search) is feasible.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means we can achieve a component size of at least `mid` by removing `k` edges, so the lower bound (`l`) is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `False`, it means we cannot achieve a component size of at least `mid`, so the upper bound (`r`) is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - The final value of `r` after the binary search is the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

Given the descriptions and the logic of the functions, they appear to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The binary search ensures that the maximum possible value of `x` is found efficiently, and the `check` function correctly determines if a given `x` is feasible.

Correctness: **True**
