### Reasoning:

1. **Program Structure and Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`) and the number of edges to be removed (`k`), and then reads the edges of the tree.
   - The edges are stored in a list called `edges`.

2. **Tree Representation**:
   - The adjacency list representation of the tree is constructed correctly using the `func_1` function.
   - This ensures that each vertex points to its neighbors, which is essential for determining connected components.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**:
   - The binary search approach in `func_1` is designed to find the maximum possible size `x` of each remaining connected component.
   - The `check` function is used to verify if it's possible to achieve a component size of `mid` by removing exactly `k` edges.
   - The binary search iterates over possible values of `mid` and uses the `check` function to validate each guess.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree and count the number of connected components that meet the size requirement.
   - It correctly handles the DFS traversal and updates the necessary variables (`visited`, `stack`, `d`).
   - The function returns `True` if the number of valid components is greater than `k` or if the root component is large enough and the number of valid components equals `k`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of the binary search, which is the maximum possible size `x` of each remaining connected component.
