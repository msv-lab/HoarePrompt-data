You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]

    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `check` accepts an integer `A` and a tree structure represented by a dictionary `g`. It checks whether it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that all remaining connected components have at least `A` vertices. If this condition can be met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**: 
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.
   
2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The function uses binary search to find the maximum value `x`. The lower bound `l` is set to 1, and the upper bound `r` is set to `n // k`. This is because the minimum possible size of a connected component is 1, and the maximum possible size is the average size of the components after removing `k` edges.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `l` exceeds `r`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, the `check` function is called to verify if it's possible to have all connected components of size at least `mid` after removing `k` edges.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components that can be formed with nodes having at least `A` nodes.
   - It uses a stack to traverse the tree and keeps track of visited nodes and their sizes.
   - If the number of such components is greater than `k` or if the largest component is of size at least `A` and the number of components is exactly `k`, it returns `True`.

5. **Binary Search Adjustment**:
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a potential candidate for the answer, so the lower bound `l` is adjusted to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the upper bound `r` is adjusted to `mid - 1`.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search loop, the function prints `r`, which is the maximum value `x` that satisfies the condition.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the `check` function correctly counts the number of connected components that meet the size requirement.
- The binary search approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `x`.
- The implementation handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.
