The function `check` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function also takes a parameter `g`, which is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, representing the tree structure.

The function returns `True` in Case_1 and `False` in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `check` is to accept an integer `A` and a tree structure represented by a dictionary `g`. It then checks whether, after removing k edges, all remaining connected components in the tree have a size of at least `A`. If all components meet this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
