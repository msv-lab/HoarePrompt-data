#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: Output State: `g` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is a list containing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex. Specifically, for each edge `(a, b)` in `edges`, both `a` and `b` will have each other in their respective neighbor lists.

    #This is printed: r (where r is the value of r, given that l is greater than r but no explicit value for r is provided)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph and then performs a binary search to find a value `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. g is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, representing the tree structure.

        #The program returns True

    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check` accepts an integer `A` and a tree structure represented by a dictionary `g`. It checks whether it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that all remaining connected components have at least `A` vertices. If this condition can be met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
