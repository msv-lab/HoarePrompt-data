The function `check` accepts an integer `A` and a tree structure represented by a dictionary `g`. It checks whether it is possible to remove `k` edges from the tree such that all remaining connected components have at least `A` vertices. If this condition can be met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
