Output State: **`visited` is an empty set, stack is [(1, 1)], A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, g is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, representing the tree structure.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. This does not affect the values of `stack`, `A`, or `g`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
