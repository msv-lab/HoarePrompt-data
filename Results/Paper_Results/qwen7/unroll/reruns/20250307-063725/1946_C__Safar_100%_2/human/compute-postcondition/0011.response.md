The function `check` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function also takes a parameter `g`, which is a dictionary where keys are vertex indices and values are lists of adjacent vertices, representing the tree structure.

The function returns True in Case_1, and False in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `check` is to accept an integer `A` and a tree structure represented by a dictionary `g`. The function then checks if it's possible to remove k edges from the tree such that all remaining connected components have at least `A` vertices. If it is possible, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
