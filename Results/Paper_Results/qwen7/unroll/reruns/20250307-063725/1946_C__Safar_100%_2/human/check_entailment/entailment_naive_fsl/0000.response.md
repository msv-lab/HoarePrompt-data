Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_1` function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \). However, the binary search implementation is flawed. Specifically, the `check` function is not correctly implemented to verify if it's possible to achieve a given \( x \).

2. **Incorrect Check Function**: The `check` function does not properly validate whether the removal of edges results in connected components of at least size \( x \). It only checks if the root node (1) has a size of at least \( x \) and counts the number of connected components, but it does not ensure that all components meet the size requirement.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 1
  1 2
  1 3
  3 4
  3 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: 2

However, the provided program would incorrectly output 1 because it does not properly validate the size of each connected component after edge removal.

A correct solution would involve a more detailed approach to validate the sizes of the connected components after edge removal, ensuring that each component meets the required size \( x \).
