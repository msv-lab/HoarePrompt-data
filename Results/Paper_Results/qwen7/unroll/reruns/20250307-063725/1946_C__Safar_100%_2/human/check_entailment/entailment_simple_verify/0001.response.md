### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This part is correct and well-implemented.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The function uses binary search to find the maximum value `x`. The lower bound `l` is set to 1, and the upper bound `r` is set to `n // k`. This is a reasonable initial setup for the binary search, as the minimum possible size of a connected component is 1, and the maximum possible size is the average size of the components after removing `k` edges.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `l` exceeds `r`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, the `check` function is called to verify if it's possible to have all connected components of size at least `mid` after removing `k` edges.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components that can be formed with nodes having at least `A` nodes.
   - It uses a stack to traverse the tree and keeps track of visited nodes and their sizes.
   - However, there is a critical issue in the `check` function. The function does not correctly handle the case where the largest component is exactly `A` and the number of components is exactly `k`. Specifically, the condition `if (r > k or d[1] >= A and r == k)` should be `if (r >= k and d[1] >= A)`. The current implementation might incorrectly return `True` when the largest component is exactly `A` and the number of components is exactly `k`.

5. **Binary Search Adjustment**:
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a potential candidate for the answer, so the lower bound `l` is adjusted to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the upper bound `r` is adjusted to `mid - 1`.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search loop, the function prints `r`, which is the maximum value `x` that satisfies the condition.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the `check` function correctly counts the number of connected components that meet the size requirement, but it fails to correctly handle the case where the largest component is exactly `A` and the number of components is exactly `k`.
- The binary search approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of `x`, but the `check` function's condition needs to be fixed.

### Conclusion:
The given program is almost correct, but there is a logical error in the `check` function that causes it to return incorrect results in certain cases. Specifically, the condition in the `check` function should be `if (r >= k and d[1] >= A)` instead of `if (r > k or d[1] >= A and r == k)`.

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
