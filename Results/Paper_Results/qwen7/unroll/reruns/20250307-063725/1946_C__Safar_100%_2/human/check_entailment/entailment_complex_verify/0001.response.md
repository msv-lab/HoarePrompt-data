### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is correct and necessary for further processing.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The function uses binary search to find the maximum value `x`. The lower bound `l` is set to 1, and the upper bound `r` is set to `n // k`. This is correct because the minimum possible size of a connected component is 1, and the maximum possible size is the average size of the components after removing `k` edges.

3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues until `l` exceeds `r`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, the `check` function is called to verify if it's possible to have all connected components of size at least `mid` after removing `k` edges. This is the core logic of the solution.

4. **Check Function**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to count the number of connected components that can be formed with nodes having at least `A` nodes.
   - It uses a stack to traverse the tree and keeps track of visited nodes and their sizes. However, there is a critical issue in the implementation of the `check` function:
     - The `visited` set is used to keep track of visited nodes, but the `d` dictionary is used to store the size of components. The `d` dictionary is updated incorrectly, leading to incorrect results.
     - Specifically, when a node `x` is revisited, its size should be added to the parent node `p`, but the current implementation adds the size of `x` to `p` only if `d[x]` is less than `A`. This leads to incorrect counting of components.

5. **Binary Search Adjustment**:
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a potential candidate for the answer, so the lower bound `l` is adjusted to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the upper bound `r` is adjusted to `mid - 1`. This part is correct.

6. **Output**:
   - After the binary search loop, the function prints `r`, which is the maximum value `x` that satisfies the condition. However, due to the issues in the `check` function, the result may be incorrect.

### Analysis:
- The logic in the `check` function is flawed because it incorrectly updates the sizes of components. This leads to incorrect counts of connected components that meet the size requirement.
- The binary search approach is correct, but the `check` function's implementation is incorrect, leading to potentially wrong results.

### Conclusion:
The given program is not correct because the `check` function has a logical error in how it counts the sizes of connected components. The program fails to accurately determine the maximum value `x` that satisfies the condition.

**Correctness:** False

Final: **False**
