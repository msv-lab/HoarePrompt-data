The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of a graph and then performs a binary search to find a value `r`. Finally, it prints the value of `r`.
