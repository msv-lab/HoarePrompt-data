### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - The function constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph using the given edges.
   - This part is correct and ensures that the graph is built properly.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - The function performs a binary search to find the maximum value \( x \).
   - The binary search is defined by the variables `l` and `r`, which represent the lower and upper bounds of the search space.
   - The `mid` value is calculated as the midpoint between `l` and `r`.

3. **Check Function Call**:
   - The function calls `check(mid)` to determine if it's possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `mid` vertices.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means that `mid` is a feasible value, and the search range is adjusted to the right half (`l = mid + 1`).
   - Otherwise, the search range is adjusted to the left half (`r = mid - 1`).

4. **Output**:
   - The function prints `r`, which is the result of the binary search.

#### Function 2 (`check`):

1. **Graph Traversal**:
   - The function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the graph.
   - It maintains a stack to keep track of the current path and a dictionary `d` to store the size of each subtree rooted at each node.
   - The function also keeps track of visited nodes using the `visited` set.

2. **Component Size Validation**:
   - For each node, the function checks if the size of the subtree rooted at that node is at least `A`.
   - If the size of the subtree is at least `A`, it increments the count of valid components (`r`).
   - If the size is less than `A`, it updates the parent node's subtree size accordingly.

3. **Return Condition**:
   - The function returns `True` if the number of valid components is greater than `k` or if the size of the root node's subtree is at least `A` and the number of valid components is exactly `k`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Binary Search Range**:
   - The initial range for the binary search is set to `[1, n // k]`. This might not cover all possible values of \( x \), especially for small trees or when \( k \) is close to \( n \).

2. **Check Function Logic**:
   - The `check` function does not correctly validate the sizes of all connected components. It only checks the root node and the number of valid components, but it does not ensure that each component meets the size requirement.

### Example Analysis:

Consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 1
  1 2
  1 3
  3 4
  3 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: 2

- **Program Output**: 1

In this case, the program incorrectly outputs 1 because it does not properly validate the sizes of the connected components after edge removal.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \).

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
