Output State: **The value of t is 0, and the variable ans contains the sum of minimum absolute differences between elements in list a and the closest elements in list b for each iteration.**

Explanation: The loop starts with `t` as an input integer between 1 and 100. After each iteration of the loop, `t` is decremented by 1. Once `t` becomes 0, the loop terminates. Inside the loop, the program processes pairs of lists `a` and `b`, calculates the minimum absolute differences, and accumulates these differences into the variable `ans`. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `ans` will hold the total sum of the minimum absolute differences calculated for all processed pairs of lists `a` and `b`.
