Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum possible total difference \(D\) by choosing \(n\) integers from \(m\) integers and arranging them to form a new array \(c_i\), such that the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) is maximized.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code correctly sorts the array `b` and uses a max heap to keep track of the largest differences for each element in `a`.
   - It iterates through each element in `a`, calculates the differences with the smallest and largest elements in the sorted `b`, and pushes these differences into the max heap.
   - The while loop pops the largest difference from the heap and assigns it to the current element in `a`. It adjusts the pointers `tp1` and `tp2` to ensure that the chosen elements from `b` are within the range `[tp1, tp2]`.

3. **Heap Usage**:
   - The use of a max heap ensures that the largest difference is always considered first, which helps in maximizing the total difference \(D\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the chosen indices from `b` might go out of bounds by adjusting `tp1` and `tp2` accordingly.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed for each test case, which is the maximum possible total difference \(D\).

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
