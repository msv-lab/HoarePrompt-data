Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes integers n and m (with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5) and an array of pairs (a_i, b_i) (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). It returns different values based on the conditions specified for n, m, and the pairs (a_i, b_i).**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving two integers n and m, and an array of pairs (a_i, b_i). The function processes these inputs according to the given constraints and returns appropriate results for each test case.
