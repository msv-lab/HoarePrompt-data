Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (with \( 1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)), and two lists \( a \) and \( b \) (each containing \( m \) integers with \( 1 \leq a_i, b_i \leq 10^9 \)). For each element in list \( a \), it finds the closest element in list \( b \) and calculates the sum of the minimum absolute differences between these elements. Finally, it prints the total sum of these minimum absolute differences for all test cases.**
