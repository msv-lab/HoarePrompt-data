Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the values in `b` are not distinct. In the example provided in the problem statement:

```
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program should maximize the total difference `D`. However, the current implementation does not consider the possibility of choosing different elements from `b` to maximize the difference. For instance, if we take the array `c` as `(5, 4, 3, 2, 1)`, the total difference `D` would be `16`, but the program calculates a smaller value.

A specific case where the program fails is when the arrays `a` and `b` are identical. The program should return `0` in such cases, but it does not handle this correctly due to the way it processes the heap and indices.

Here is an example input where the program does not work as expected:
```
5 5
1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The expected output is `0`, but the program might output a non-zero value due to the incorrect handling of the heap and indices.
