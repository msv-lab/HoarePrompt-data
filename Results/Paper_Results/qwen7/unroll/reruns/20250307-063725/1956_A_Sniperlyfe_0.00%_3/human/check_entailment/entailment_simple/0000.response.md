### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions specified by the sequence `a`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain after all rounds of removals.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function simulates the game process for a given `n` and sequence `p`.
   - It repeatedly removes players until no more players can be removed in a round.
   - The function correctly implements the logic to remove players based on the sequence `p` and ensures that players are not removed if their position exceeds the current number of players.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input for each test case, including `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each initial player count `n` in `qs` and collects the results.
   - The results are printed in the required format.

4. **Verification:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the removal of players and ensures that the game ends when no more players can be removed.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
