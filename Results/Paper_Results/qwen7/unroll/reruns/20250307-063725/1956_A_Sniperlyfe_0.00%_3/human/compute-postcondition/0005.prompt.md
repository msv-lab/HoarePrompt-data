You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; qs is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = []
        
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each line containing `q` space-separated integers. Each integer on these lines represents the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The values of `k`, `p`, and `qs` will vary across different iterations based on user input, but the output will always follow the pattern described.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: k and q, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p, which is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; qs, which is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100. The function returns a list of q elements, where each element corresponds to whether n_i from qs is present in the sequence a represented by p.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
