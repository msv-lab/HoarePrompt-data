Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the number of winners in a game based on a sequence of positions to be removed in each round.
- The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to simulate the game for a given initial number of players `n` and a sequence `p` of positions to remove.
- The `func_2` function reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The `func_2` function's execution summary indicates that it correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the implementation of both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) aligns with the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
