### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1(n, p)` aims to simulate the process of kicking out players from the game.
   - It iteratively subtracts the number of players to be kicked out (`sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`) from `n` until `n` is less than the smallest value in `p`.
   - This function correctly implements the logic for determining the number of players remaining after each round of the game.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2()` reads input and processes it using `func_1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, and the sequence `p`.
   - It then processes each value `n` in `qs` by calling `func_1(n, p)` and appending the result to the list `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
   - The input format matches the problem description, and the output format is also correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is smaller than the smallest value in `p`, where no players are kicked out in that round.
   - The function also handles cases where `n` is exactly equal to the smallest value in `p`, ensuring that exactly one player is kicked out.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The implementation of both functions is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
   - The program correctly simulates the game and outputs the number of winners for each initial number of players.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.
