### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game where players are removed based on positions defined by the sequence `p`.
   - For each initial number of players `n`, we need to determine how many players remain until no more can be removed.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n` (number of players) and `p` (positions to remove).
   - It iteratively removes players from the sequence until no more can be removed.
   - The logic inside the function is correct:
     - `while n >= min(p):` ensures that we continue removing players as long as there are enough players left to match any position in `p`.
     - `n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))` correctly removes the players at the specified positions.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case:
     - Reads `k` and `q`.
     - Reads the sequence `p`.
     - Reads the list of initial player counts `qs`.
     - Calls `func_1` for each `n` in `qs` and appends the result to `res`.
     - Prints the results for each test case.

4. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic in both functions appears to be correct and matches the problem's requirements.
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the removal process, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
