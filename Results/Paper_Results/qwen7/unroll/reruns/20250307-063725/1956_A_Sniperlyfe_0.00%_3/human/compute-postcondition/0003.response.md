Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each line containing `q` space-separated integers. Each integer on these lines represents the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The values of `k`, `p`, and `qs` will vary across different iterations based on user input, but the output will always follow the pattern described.
