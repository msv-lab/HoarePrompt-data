The function accepts four parameters: two positive integers \( k \) and \( q \), a list \( p \) of \( k \) integers, and a list \( qs \) of \( q \) integers. It processes each integer \( n \) in \( qs \) by checking if \( n \) is present in the sequence \( p \). For each \( n \), it calls another function `func_1(n, p)` to determine if \( n \) is in \( p \). The results of these checks are collected into a list `res`. Finally, the function prints each line consisting of \( q \) space-separated integers from `res`, corresponding to the results of the checks for each \( n \) in \( qs \) during the respective iteration.
