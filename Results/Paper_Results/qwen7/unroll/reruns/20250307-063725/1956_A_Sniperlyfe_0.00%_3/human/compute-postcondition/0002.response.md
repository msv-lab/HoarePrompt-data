Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing `q` space-separated integers. Each line corresponds to the results of `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` for a given set of `k` and `p`. The values of `k`, `q`, `p`, and `qs` change with each iteration of the loop, but the output for each iteration is determined by the function `func_1(n, p)` applied to each element in `qs`. The initial values of `k`, `q`, `p`, `qs`, and `t` are provided in the initial state, and these values are used to generate the output for each iteration of the loop.
