You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the initial number of players in the game, and p is a list of positive integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100.

    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum(1 for x in p if x <= n)
        
    #State: The final value of n will be 0 or a positive integer less than the minimum value in p.
    return n
    #The program returns a value of n which is 0 or a positive integer less than the minimum value in p.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; qs is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100.
def func_2():

    for _ in range(t):
        k, q = map(int, input().split())
        
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))

            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each line containing `q` space-separated integers. Each integer on these lines represents the result of calling `func_1(n, p)` for each `n` in `qs` during the corresponding iteration of the loop. The values of `k`, `p`, and `qs` will vary across different iterations based on user input, but the output will always follow the pattern described.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes two parameters: `n` (number of players) and `p` (sequence of positions).
   - It iteratively removes players from the game until no more players can be removed.
   - The logic inside the function is correct. It uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the sum of players that need to be removed (`sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))`) from `n` until `n` is less than the minimum position in `p`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function handles the input and output for multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `k`, `q`, the sequence `p`, and the list of initial player counts `qs`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each value in `qs` and appends the result to `res`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic in `func_2` correctly processes each test case and applies the `func_1` function to determine the number of winners for each initial player count.
   - The logic for handling multiple test cases and printing the results is also correct.

### Testing the Functionality

To ensure the correctness, let's test the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  6
  2 1
  3 5
  5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2 
  ```

- Explanation:
  - With `n = 5`, the sequence `p = [3, 5]`.
  - First round: Remove players at positions 3 and 5 (C and E). Remaining players: ABD.
  - Second round: Remove player at position 3 (D). Remaining players: AB.
  - No more players can be removed, so A and B are winners.

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5 4
  3 4 5 6 7
  1 2 3 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 1 1 
  ```

- Explanation:
  - With `n = 1`, only player A remains.
  - With `n = 2`, players A and B remain.
  - With `n = 3`, players A, B, and C remain.
  - With `n = 4`, players A, B, C, and D remain.

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  2 3
  69 96
  1 10 100
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1 10 68 
  ```

- Explanation:
  - With `n = 1`, only player A remains.
  - With `n = 10`, players A through J remain.
  - With `n = 100`, players A through Y remain (since 100 - 68 = 32, and 32 + 68 = 100).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of winners for each initial player count. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the problem as described in the problem statement.
