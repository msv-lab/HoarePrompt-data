Reasoning:
- **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the logic to simulate the game process. It iteratively subtracts the count of elements in the sequence `p` that are less than or equal to `n` from `n` until `n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. The final value of `n` returned by this function accurately reflects the number of players remaining after the game ends.
- **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly reads the input and processes each test case. It calls `func_1` for each value in `qs` and collects the results. The results are printed in the correct format, with each line containing the results for a specific test case.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, both functions correctly implement the required logic to determine the number of winners for each initial number of players. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
