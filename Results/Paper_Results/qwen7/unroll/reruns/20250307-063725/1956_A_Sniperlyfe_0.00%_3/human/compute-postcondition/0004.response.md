Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: k and q, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 100; p, which is a list of k integers representing the sequence a where 1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_k ≤ 100; qs, which is a list of q integers representing n_i where 1 ≤ n_i ≤ 100. The function returns a list of q elements, where each element corresponds to whether n_i from qs is present in the sequence a represented by p.**

This means the function checks if each integer in the list `qs` is present in the sequence `p` and returns a list indicating the presence of each `n_i` in `qs` within the sequence `p`.
