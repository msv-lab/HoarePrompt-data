Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of removing players from the game based on the sequence `p`. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the sequence `p` contains indices that exceed the current number of players.
   - For example, consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`. According to the problem description, in the first round, players at positions 3 and 5 are removed. However, in the second round, since only 2 players remain, the position 5 cannot be reached, and thus, the function incorrectly skips the removal of the 5th player.

2. **Example to Demonstrate Incorrect Behavior:**
   - Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`.
     - Initial lineup: ABCDE
     - First round: Remove C (3rd) and E (5th). Lineup becomes AB.
     - Second round: Attempt to remove the 3rd player (D), but since only 2 players remain, the 3rd player cannot be found. Therefore, no players are removed in the second round.
     - Final result: AB are winners.
   - However, the function `func_1` would incorrectly skip the removal of the 5th player in the second round, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
