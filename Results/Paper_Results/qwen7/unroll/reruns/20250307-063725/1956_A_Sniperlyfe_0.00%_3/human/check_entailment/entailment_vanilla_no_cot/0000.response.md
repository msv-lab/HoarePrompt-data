To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of `func_1` and `func_2`.

### Analysis of `func_1`

The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of kicking out players until no more players can be found at the specified positions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `n` (the number of remaining players) is greater than or equal to the smallest position in `p`.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Inside the loop, it calculates the total number of players to be removed in this round by iterating over `p` and counting how many players are at positions less than or equal to `n`.
3. **Subtraction**: It subtracts this count from `n` in each iteration.
4. **Return**: Once the loop exits, it returns the remaining number of players.

This logic correctly simulates the described game process.

### Analysis of `func_2`

The function `func_2` processes the input and calls `func_1` for each query:

1. **Input Reading**: It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Loop Over Test Cases**: For each test case, it reads `k`, `q`, and the sequence `p`.
3. **Query Processing**: For each query `n` in `qs`, it calls `func_1` and appends the result to `res`.
4. **Output**: It prints the results for each query.

This logic correctly processes the input and outputs the results as required.

### Conclusion

Given the problem description and the provided code, the logic implemented in both functions appears to be correct. The `func_1` correctly simulates the game process, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**True**
