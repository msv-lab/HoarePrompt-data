You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Nene invented a new game based on an increasing sequence of integers a_1, a_2,
\ldots, a_k .

In this game, initially n players are lined up in a row. In each of the rounds
of this game, the following happens:

  * Nene finds the a_1 -th, a_2 -th, \ldots , a_k -th players in a row. They are kicked out of the game simultaneously. If the i -th player in a row should be kicked out, but there are fewer than i players in a row, they are skipped. 

Once no one is kicked out of the game in some round, all the players that are
still in the game are declared as winners.

For example, consider the game with a=[3, 5] and n=5 players. Let the players
be named player A, player B, \ldots , player E in the order they are lined up
initially. Then,

  * Before the first round, players are lined up as ABCDE. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. These are players C and E. They are kicked out in the first round. 
  * Now players are lined up as ABD. Nene finds the 3 -rd and the 5 -th players in a row. The 3 -rd player is player D and there is no 5 -th player in a row. Thus, only player D is kicked out in the second round. 
  * In the third round, no one is kicked out of the game, so the game ends after this round. 
  * Players A and B are declared as the winners. 

Nene has not yet decided how many people would join the game initially. Nene
gave you q integers n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_q and you should answer the following
question for each 1 \le i \le q independently:

  * How many people would be declared as winners if there are n_i players in the game initially? 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 250 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line case contains two integers k and q (1 \le k, q \le 100 ) — the
length of the sequence a and the number of values n_i you should solve this
problem for.

The second line contains k integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k (1\leq
a_1<a_2<\ldots<a_k\leq 100 ) — the sequence a .

The third line contains q integers n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_q (1\leq n_i \leq 100 ).

Output

For each test case, output q integers: the i -th (1\le i \le q ) of them
should be the number of players declared as winners if initially n_i players
join the game.

Note

The first test case was explained in the statement.

In the second test case, when n=1 , the only player stays in the game in the
first round. After that, the game ends and the only player is declared as a
winner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, p):
    while n >= min(p):
        n -= sum((1 for x in p if x <= n))
    return n

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (k, q) = map(int, input().split())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = []
        for n in qs:
            res.append(func_1(n, p))
            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts four parameters: two positive integers \( k \) and \( q \), a list \( p \) of \( k \) integers, and a list \( qs \) of \( q \) integers. It processes each integer \( n \) in \( qs \) by checking if \( n \) is present in the sequence \( p \). For each \( n \), it calls another function `func_1(n, p)` to determine if \( n \) is in \( p \). The results of these checks are collected into a list `res`. Finally, the function prints each line consisting of \( q \) space-separated integers from `res`, corresponding to the results of the checks for each \( n \) in \( qs \) during the respective iteration.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of winners in the game. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not accurately simulate the process of kicking out players based on the sequence `p`. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to simulate the process of removing players from the game based on the sequence `p`. However, it does not correctly handle the scenario where the sequence `p` contains indices that exceed the current number of players.
   - For example, consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`. According to the problem description, in the first round, players at positions 3 and 5 are removed. However, in the second round, since only 2 players remain, the position 5 cannot be reached, and thus, the function incorrectly skips the removal of the 5th player.

2. **Example to Demonstrate Incorrect Behavior:**
   - Consider the sequence `p = [3, 5]` and `n = 5`.
     - Initial lineup: ABCDE
     - First round: Remove C (3rd) and E (5th). Lineup becomes AB.
     - Second round: Attempt to remove the 3rd player (D), but since only 2 players remain, the 3rd player cannot be found. Therefore, no players are removed in the second round.
     - Final result: AB are winners.
   - However, the function `func_1` would incorrectly skip the removal of the 5th player in the second round, leading to an incorrect result.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly implement the game logic for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
