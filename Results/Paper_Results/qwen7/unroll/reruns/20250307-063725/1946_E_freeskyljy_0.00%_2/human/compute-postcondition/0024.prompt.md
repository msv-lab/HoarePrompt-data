Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`, and `M1` is not greater than 1 or `M2` is not greater than 1 or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
