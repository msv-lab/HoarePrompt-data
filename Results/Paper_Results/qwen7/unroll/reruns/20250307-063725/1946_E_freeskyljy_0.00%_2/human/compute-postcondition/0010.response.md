Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, the first element of `L` is 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.
