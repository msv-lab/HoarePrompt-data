Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the last prefix maximum index is not equal to the first suffix maximum index. This is a critical requirement according to the problem description.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 2 2
1 2
2 3
```
In this case, the last prefix maximum index is `2` and the first suffix maximum index is also `2`. However, the program incorrectly returns `0` because it checks if `L[-1]` (which is `2`) is equal to `R[0]` (which is `2`), but it does not properly handle the logic for calculating the number of valid permutations.

The program should correctly calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums, but it fails to do so in this specific case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
