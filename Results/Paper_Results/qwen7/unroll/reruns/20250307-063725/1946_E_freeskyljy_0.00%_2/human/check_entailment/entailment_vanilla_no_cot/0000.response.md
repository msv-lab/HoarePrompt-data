Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases**: The function `func_1` does not handle all edge cases correctly. For example, it does not properly check if the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the constraints of being prefix and suffix maximums.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Combinations**: The calculation of combinations (`ans = math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`) is only performed under certain conditions but does not cover all necessary checks. The logic to calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums is incomplete and flawed.

3. **Inconsistent Logic**: The logic for updating `ans` using combinations and decrementing `nums_left` is not correctly aligned with the problem's requirements. Specifically, the way `ans` is updated and the conditions under which it is updated are not correctly implemented.

4. **Missing Checks**: There are missing checks to ensure that the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums are valid and consistent with the problem statement. For instance, the function does not verify that the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums correctly.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to implement a more comprehensive approach that ensures all constraints are met and calculates the number of valid permutations accurately.
