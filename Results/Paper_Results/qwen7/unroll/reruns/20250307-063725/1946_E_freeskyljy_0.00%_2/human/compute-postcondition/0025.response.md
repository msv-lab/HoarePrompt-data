Postcondition: **`ans` is the result of the modular multiplication of `ans` with `nums_left` for each iteration where `i` does not match `L[cur]`, and `nums_left` will be decremented by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer greater than 1.**

This means that if `M1 > 1`, the value of `ans` will be updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` for each `i` that does not match the current value of `L[cur]`, and `nums_left` will be decreased by 1 in each such iteration until `i` is no longer greater than 1. If `M1 <= 1`, the value of `ans` remains unchanged as there is no corresponding else part to alter it.
