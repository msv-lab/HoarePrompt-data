Output State: **`nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`, and `M1` is not greater than 1 or `M2` is not greater than 1 or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, and `M1` is greater than 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns `L[-1] - 2` to `nums_left`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
