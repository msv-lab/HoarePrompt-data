Postcondition: **`nums_left` is 0, `cur` is `R.length`, and `ans` is the product of `(N - R[0] - 1)` factorial.**

This postcondition summarizes that regardless of whether the condition `M2 > 1` is true or false, the final state of the variables is such that `nums_left` is set to 0, `cur` is set to `R.length`, and `ans` holds the product of `(N - R[0] - 1)` factorial.
