Output State: **cur is R.length, ans is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) factorial, and nums_left is 0.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all iterations, `cur` will be equal to the length of array `R` because every element in `R` is processed exactly once in the loop. The variable `nums_left` starts at `N - R[0] - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. The variable `ans` is updated in each iteration where `i` is not equal to `R[cur]` (which happens for all `i` except when `i` equals an element in `R`), and it is multiplied by `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. Therefore, `ans` will be the product of `(N - R[0] - 1)!` modulo `MOD`.
