Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`, and either `M1` is not greater than 1 or `M2` is not greater than 1 or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`**.

Explanation: The code `cur = M1 - 2` assigns the value of `M1 - 2` to the variable `cur`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `R`, `L`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states.
