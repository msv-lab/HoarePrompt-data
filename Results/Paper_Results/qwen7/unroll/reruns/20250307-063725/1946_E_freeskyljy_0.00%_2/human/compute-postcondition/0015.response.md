Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. Additionally, either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is equal to `N`. Either `M1` is not greater than 1 or `M2` is not greater than 1 or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.
