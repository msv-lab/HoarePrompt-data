Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `L` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to `L`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and `N`, `M1`, and `M2` retain their original values obtained from the input.
