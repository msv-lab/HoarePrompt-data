Functionality: **The function checks several conditions based on the inputs `L` and `R`. If any of the specified conditions are not met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the product of the factorial of `(N - R[0] - 1)`, where `N` is the length of the list `R` and `R[0]` is the first element in the list `R`.**
