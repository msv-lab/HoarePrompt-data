### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Initial Checks:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the length of the permutation `N`, the number of prefix maximums `M1`, and the number of suffix maximums `M2`.
   - It reads the indices of the prefix maximums `L` and the suffix maximums `R`.
   - The program checks if the last index of `L` (the last prefix maximum) is equal to the first index of `R` (the first suffix maximum). If not, it returns 0. This is a critical check as it ensures the permutation can have a consistent maximum at both the end of the prefix and the start of the suffix.
   - It also checks if the first index of `L` is 1 and the first index of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns 0. This ensures the permutation starts and ends with the largest possible values.

2. **Combinatorial Calculation:**
   - The program uses `math.comb` to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining elements after fixing the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It iterates through the prefix maximums and suffix maximums to adjust the count of possible permutations based on their positions. This involves decrementing the count of available numbers for placement as it moves through the indices.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The check for `L[-2] == R[1]` is unnecessary and can be removed. This condition is already covered by the checks for the first and last elements of `L` and `R`.
   - The logic for adjusting the count of permutations based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums is correct but should be tested thoroughly with various edge cases.

### Evaluation:

- The program correctly handles the constraints and conditions specified in the problem description.
- The combinatorial calculation and modulo operation are implemented correctly.
- The checks for the first and last elements of `L` and `R` ensure the permutation can have a consistent maximum at both the end of the prefix and the start of the suffix.
- The logic for adjusting the count of permutations based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums is correct but should be tested with various edge cases.
