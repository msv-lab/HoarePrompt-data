Output State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, and `M2` is greater than 1**

Explanation: The variable `cur` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `nums_left` and `M2` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `nums_left` is still `N - R[0] - 1`, and `M2` is still greater than 1.
