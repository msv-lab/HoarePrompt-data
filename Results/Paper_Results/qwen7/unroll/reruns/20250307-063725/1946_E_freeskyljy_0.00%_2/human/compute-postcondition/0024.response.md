Output State: **The value of `ans` will be the result of the modular multiplication of `ans` with `nums_left` for each iteration where `i` does not match `L[cur]`, and `nums_left` will be decremented by 1 in each iteration until `i` is no longer greater than 1.**

To break it down further:
- The variable `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- The variable `i` starts at `L[-1] - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
- If `i` equals `L[cur]` during any iteration, then `cur` is decremented by 1.
- Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying its current value with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`.

Since the loop continues as long as `i > 1`, the final value of `i` will be 1 when the loop exits. The exact value of `ans` will depend on the specific values of `nums_left` and `L[cur]` during each iteration, but it will always be the result of the specified operations performed within the loop.
