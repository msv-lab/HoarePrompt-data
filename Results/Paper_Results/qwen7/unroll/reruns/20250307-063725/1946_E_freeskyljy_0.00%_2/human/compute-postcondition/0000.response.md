Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are updated based on the input, but their specific values are not known without further input.
