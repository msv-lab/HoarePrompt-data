You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the last prefix maximum index is not equal to the first suffix maximum index. This is a critical requirement according to the problem description.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 2 2
1 2
2 3
```
In this case, the last prefix maximum index is `2` and the first suffix maximum index is also `2`. However, the program incorrectly returns `0` because it checks if `L[-1]` (which is `2`) is equal to `R[0]` (which is `2`), but it does not properly handle the logic for calculating the number of valid permutations.

The program should correctly calculate the number of valid permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums, but it fails to do so in this specific case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
