Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are integers obtained from the input split, `R` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string**.

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `R`. The variables `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `R` and retains the initial states of `t`, `N`, `M1`, and `M2`.
