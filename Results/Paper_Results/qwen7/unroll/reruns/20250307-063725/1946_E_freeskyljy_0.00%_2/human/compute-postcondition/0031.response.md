Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `cur` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1` (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is `R[0] + 1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop `while i < N` to execute at least once, the initial value of `i` must satisfy the condition `i < N`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `R[0] + 1`, we need to ensure that `R[0] + 1 < N`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `i` to ensure that the loop condition is met.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` must be less than `N`**
