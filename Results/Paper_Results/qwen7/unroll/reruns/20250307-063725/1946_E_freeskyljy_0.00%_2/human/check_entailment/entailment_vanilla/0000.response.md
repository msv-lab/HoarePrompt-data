Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `N`, the number of prefix maximums `M1`, and the number of suffix maximums `M2`.
3. It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `L` and the suffix maximums `R`.
4. The program checks if the last index of `L` (the last prefix maximum) is equal to the first index of `R` (the first suffix maximum). If not, it returns 0 because no permutation can satisfy both conditions simultaneously.
5. It also checks if the first index of `L` is 1 and the first index of `R` is `N`. If not, it returns 0 for the same reason.
6. If the above conditions are satisfied, it calculates the number of suitable permutations using combinatorial mathematics (`math.comb`).
7. It iterates through the prefix maximums and suffix maximums to adjust the count of possible permutations based on their positions.
8. Finally, it returns the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The logic seems to handle the constraints and conditions correctly. However, there are a few potential issues:
- The check for `L[-2] == R[1]` might not be necessary unless there's a specific condition that needs to be checked.
- The logic for adjusting the count of permutations based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums seems correct but should be thoroughly tested with various edge cases.

Given the example and the nature of the problem, the provided solution appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
