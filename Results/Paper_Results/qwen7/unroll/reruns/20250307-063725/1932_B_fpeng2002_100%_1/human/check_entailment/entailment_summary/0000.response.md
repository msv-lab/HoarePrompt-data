Reasoning:
The given program aims to calculate the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the periodicities provided. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `num_tests` to read the number of test cases and uses a loop to handle each test case.
3. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`).
4. **Calculation**: The key part of the calculation is in the for loop where it iterates over the periodicities. The variable `start_year` is updated in each iteration to ensure it aligns with the next sign's periodicity. Specifically, `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.

This logic is correct because it effectively finds the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, which is the correct way to determine the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the program correctly calculates the required year for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
