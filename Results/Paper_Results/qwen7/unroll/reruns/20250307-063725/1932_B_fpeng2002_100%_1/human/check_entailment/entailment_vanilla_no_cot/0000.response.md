Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. The current implementation calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities at once, which is not the correct approach. Instead, the program should iteratively find the next occurrence of each sign sequentially.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        current_year = 0
        for a in nums:
            current_year = lcm(current_year, a)
        print(current_year)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the `lcm` function to iteratively find the next year when each sign will occur, ensuring the correct sequential waiting period for each sign.
