Reasoning:
The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, calculating the year when the nth sign will occur, and printing the result. However, the logic used to calculate the starting year is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is not correctly implementing the logic required to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, which is necessary to determine when all signs will occur sequentially.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the LCM of all the periodicities. The current implementation only considers one periodicity at a time and does not account for the sequential occurrence of signs. This approach will not yield the correct result.

Here's the correct approach:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of signs and their periodicities.
3. Calculate the LCM of all periodicities.
4. Print the result.

Given the current logic, the program will not produce the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **False**
