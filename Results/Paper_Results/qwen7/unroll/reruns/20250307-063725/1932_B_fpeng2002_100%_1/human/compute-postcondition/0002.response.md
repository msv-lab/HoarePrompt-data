Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value of `start_year` after processing each input test case.**

Explanation: For each test case (`num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums`. It then calculates `start_year` based on the formula provided in the loop. After calculating `start_year` for each test case, it prints the result. The final output state will be a list of these calculated values, one for each test case.
