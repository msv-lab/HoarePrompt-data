Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates a starting year based on the given integers and prints the result. The function reads input from the standard input, processes up to 1000 test cases, and outputs a list of calculated starting years, one for each test case.**
