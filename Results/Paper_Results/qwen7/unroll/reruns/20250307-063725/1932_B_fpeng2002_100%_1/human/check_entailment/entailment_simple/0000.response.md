Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`nums`).
- It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is the initial year before any signs have occurred.
- In the loop, it updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the current `start_year` and the current periodicity `nums[x]`. This ensures that the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the current sign after the previous one has occurred.
- Finally, it prints the `start_year` for each test case, which represents the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the program, it correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
