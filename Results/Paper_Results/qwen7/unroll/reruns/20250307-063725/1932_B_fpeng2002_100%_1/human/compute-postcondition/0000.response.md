Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and the list of integers is still defined with the given constraints, but these details are not altered by the current line of code.
