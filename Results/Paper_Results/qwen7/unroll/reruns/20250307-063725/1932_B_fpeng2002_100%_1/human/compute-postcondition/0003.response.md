Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers. It first checks if the integer t is within the range 1 to 1000. Then, for each test case defined by t, it checks if n is within the range 1 to 100 and if the list of integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n is valid (each a_i is between 1 and 10^6). Based on these conditions, the function returns appropriate values or messages for each test case.**
