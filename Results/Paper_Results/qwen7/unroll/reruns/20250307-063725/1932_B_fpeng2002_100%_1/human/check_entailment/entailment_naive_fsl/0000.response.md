Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. According to the problem description, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one. However, the current implementation calculates `start_year` as the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, which does not guarantee that the signs will occur sequentially.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```

The program outputs `2012`, but the correct answer should be calculated step-by-step:
- First sign occurs in year 50.
- Second sign occurs in year 50 + 30 = 80.
- Third sign occurs in year 80 + 711 = 791.
- Fourth sign occurs in year 791 + 200 = 991.
- Fifth sign occurs in year 991 + 503 = 1494.
- Sixth sign occurs in year 1494 + 1006 = 2400.

The program fails to handle this sequential waiting mechanism correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
