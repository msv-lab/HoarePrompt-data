The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000. Since `num_tests` is guaranteed to be within this range, it already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000**
