You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the following list contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value of `start_year` after processing each input test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then calculates a starting year based on the given integers and prints the result. The function reads input from the standard input, processes up to 1000 test cases, and outputs a list of calculated starting years, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse occur sequentially.
   - Each sign occurs every \(a_i\) years, and the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs \(n\) and their periodicities \(a_i\).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is incorrect because it should be initialized to 1 since the first sign can occur in the 1st year.
   - The loop iterates over the periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula is incorrect for finding the least common multiple (LCM) needed for sequential occurrences.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the year when all signs occur sequentially, we need to compute the LCM of all periodicities.
   - The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.

4. **Correct Implementation:**
   - Initialize `start_year` to 1.
   - Use a function to compute the LCM of two numbers and extend it to handle multiple numbers.
   - Iterate through the periodicities and update `start_year` with the LCM of the current value and the next periodicity.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly compute the year when all signs occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
