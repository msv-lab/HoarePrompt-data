### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided implementation of `func_2` does not solve the problem as stated. The current implementation attempts to use a formula that does not match the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The corrected approach involves iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly using the `func_1` function to compute the GCD. This ensures that the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not solve the problem correctly, and the suggested correction is appropriate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem statement.
