### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided function `func_2` does not solve the problem as stated. The function `func_2` uses a formula that does not correctly count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) satisfying the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The proposed correction involves iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition directly. However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot m)\), which is not efficient given the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

A more efficient solution can be achieved by leveraging the properties of the problem. Specifically, we can use the fact that for a fixed \(b\), the valid \(a\) values can be determined by considering the multiples of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a more optimized approach:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), calculate the valid \(a\) values by checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the optimized implementation:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        gcd_b = b
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This approach still has a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot m)\), but it directly checks the condition for each pair, making it more straightforward and potentially easier to understand.

Given that the original function `func_2` does not solve the problem correctly and the proposed corrections do not significantly improve the efficiency, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as stated.
