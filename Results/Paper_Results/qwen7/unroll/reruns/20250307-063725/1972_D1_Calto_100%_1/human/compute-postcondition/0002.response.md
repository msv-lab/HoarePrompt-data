Output State: **cnt is -1.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m`. In each iteration, the values of `x` and `y` are calculated based on the current value of `i`, and `cnt` is updated. However, the initial value of `cnt` is -1, and the loop does not change this initial value because the operation `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is performed after calculating `x` and `y`, but it does not reset or modify the initial value of `cnt` in any way. Therefore, after the loop completes, `cnt` remains -1.
