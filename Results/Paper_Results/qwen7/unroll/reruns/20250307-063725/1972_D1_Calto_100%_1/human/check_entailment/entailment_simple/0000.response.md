Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. The provided program includes two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers, which is essential for solving the problem but is not used in `func_2`.
4. `func_2` is incorrectly implemented for the problem's requirements. It does not follow the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The formula `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The logic `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly count the valid pairs (a, b).

Given the incorrect implementation of `func_2`, the program as a whole is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
