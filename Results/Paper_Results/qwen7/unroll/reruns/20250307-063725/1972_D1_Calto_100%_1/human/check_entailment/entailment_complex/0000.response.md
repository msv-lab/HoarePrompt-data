Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. This is necessary for checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Function `func_2` is intended to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) for the given n and m. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically:
  - The variables `x` and `y` are calculated as `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, respectively. These calculations do not relate to the problem's requirements.
  - The logic for updating `cnt` with `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` does not correctly reflect the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the discrepancy between the problem statement and the implementation in `func_2`, the provided function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
