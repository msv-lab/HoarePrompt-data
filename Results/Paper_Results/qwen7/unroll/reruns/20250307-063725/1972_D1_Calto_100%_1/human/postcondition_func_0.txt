The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input. It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm and returns this value. Regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b`, the function ensures that upon completion, the returned value is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
