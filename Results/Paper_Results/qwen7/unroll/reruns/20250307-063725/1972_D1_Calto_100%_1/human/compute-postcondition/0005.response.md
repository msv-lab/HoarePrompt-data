Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) and iterates through a loop from 1 to `m`. For each iteration, it calculates values `x` and `y` based on the current loop index `i`. It then updates a counter `cnt` by adding the ceiling of `x` divided by `y` plus an additional 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`. After completing the loop, the function returns -1.**
