Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The function `func_1` is a correct implementation of the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd), but it is not used in `func_2` in a way that addresses the problem statement.

To solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation of `func_2` does not do this and instead uses a formula that is unrelated to the problem requirements.
