### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Functions Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It is used as a helper function but does not directly contribute to solving the main problem.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions.
   - However, the logic inside `func_2` is flawed:
     - It calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
     - It then updates a counter `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.
     - This approach does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code incorrectly states that `func_2` returns -1, which is not true. Instead, it should return the count of valid pairs.
- The state annotations for `func_2` are misleading and do not reflect the actual logic of the function.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\):
- Expected output: Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\). So, the expected output is 3.
- Running the provided program with this input will not yield the correct result because the logic in `func_2` is incorrect.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
