Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main requirement of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- `func_1` is a helper function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is correctly implemented.
- `func_2` attempts to solve the problem but uses a different approach that does not align with the problem statement. It calculates the number of pairs based on a quadratic formula, which is not relevant to the problem's constraints.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)

Expected output: The valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\). So, the expected output is 3.

However, running the provided program with this input will not yield the correct result because the logic in `func_2` is incorrect.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
