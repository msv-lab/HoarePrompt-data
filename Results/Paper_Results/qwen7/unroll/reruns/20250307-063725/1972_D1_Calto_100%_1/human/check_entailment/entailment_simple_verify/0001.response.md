### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided function `func_2` does not solve the problem as stated. The current implementation attempts to use a formula that does not align with the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The proposed corrected version of `func_2` iterates over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checks the condition directly. However, this approach has a time complexity of \(O(n \cdot m)\), which is not efficient for the given constraints (where \(n\) and \(m\) can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\)).

A more efficient approach would involve leveraging properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the given condition. Here is a more optimized solution:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
2. For each \(b\), calculate the valid values of \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the optimized version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(b, n + 1, b):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This optimized version reduces the number of iterations significantly by only considering multiples of \(b\).

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis and the optimized solution, the original program is indeed incorrect. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Final: **False**
