You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: a and b will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. Initially, `a` and `b` are positive integers within specified ranges. After the loop completes, `a` and `b` will hold the GCD of their initial values.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input. It computes their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm and returns this value. Regardless of the initial values of `a` and `b`, the function ensures that upon completion, the returned value is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: cnt is -1.
    return cnt
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6) and iterates through a loop from 1 to `m`. For each iteration, it calculates values `x` and `y` based on the current loop index `i`. It then updates a counter `cnt` by adding the ceiling of `x` divided by `y` plus an additional 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`. After completing the loop, the function returns -1.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation does not match the problem statement. Specifically, it uses a formula that does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Current Implementation
- The function `func_2` iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then counts the number of valid \(a\) values using `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This approach does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be attempting to count something else, which is why it fails to produce the correct results.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition directly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you would need to implement the logic described above.
