Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation does not match the problem statement. Specifically, it uses a formula that does not correctly count the valid pairs.

### Detailed Explanation

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
- \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
- \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
- \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Current Implementation
- The function `func_2` iterates over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
- It then counts the number of valid \(a\) values using `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`.

This approach does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be attempting to count something else, which is why it fails to produce the correct results.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition directly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, you would need to implement the logic described above.
