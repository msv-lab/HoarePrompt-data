Output State: **`cnt` is -1**

The initial state specifies that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range 1 to 2 * 10^6. The given code simply initializes `cnt` to -1. Since no operations are performed on `n` and `m`, their values remain unchanged. The only variable affected is `cnt`, which is set to -1.
