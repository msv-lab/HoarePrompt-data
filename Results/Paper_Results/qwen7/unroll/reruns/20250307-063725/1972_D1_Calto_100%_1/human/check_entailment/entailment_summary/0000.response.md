Reasoning:
The given solution uses `func_1` to calculate the GCD but does not actually use this function within `func_2`. Instead, `func_2` has a different implementation that does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the problem and the provided solution:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Solution**:
   - `func_1` correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` has a different logic that does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, it uses the formula \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\) which do not relate to the problem constraints or conditions.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition for each pair.

4. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. It uses a formula that is unrelated to the problem statement and does not account for the GCD condition.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect because `func_2` does not implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
