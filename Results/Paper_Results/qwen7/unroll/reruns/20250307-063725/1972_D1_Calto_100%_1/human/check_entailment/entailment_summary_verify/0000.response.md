### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code based on the problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description**: We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is a correct implementation and can be used as a helper function.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The original assessment claims that this function does not correctly solve the problem. However, let's analyze the function step-by-step to see if it aligns with the problem requirements.

   - The function iterates through a loop from 1 to `m`.
   - For each iteration `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then updates the counter `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to `cnt`.

Let's break down the logic inside the loop:
- `x = n - (i * i - i)` simplifies to `x = n - i * (i - 1)`.
- `y = i * i` is simply `i^2`.

The expression `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) ranges from 1 to `n` and \(b = i\).

To understand why this might work, let's consider the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). When \(b = i\), the condition becomes \(a + i\) is a multiple of \(i \cdot \gcd(a, i)\).

Given \(a = n - i * (i - 1)\), we can see that for each fixed \(i\), the value of \(a\) is derived in a way that ensures the condition holds. Specifically, the loop iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the corresponding \(a\) to check the condition.

While the original assessment claimed the function is incorrect, the provided logic seems to be a valid approach to solving the problem. The function iterates over possible values of \(b\) and calculates the corresponding \(a\) to ensure the condition is met.

### Conclusion:

The function `func_2` appears to be a valid solution to the problem, even though the original assessment stated otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
