State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. The loop condition `range(1, m + 1)` indicates that the loop will start with `i` equal to 1 and continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m`.
3. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0 because if `m` is 0 or negative, the range function will not generate any values for `i`, and the loop will not execute.
4. The initial value of `cnt` is -1, but this does not affect the loop's execution since the loop starts with `i` set to 1 regardless of the value of `cnt`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 1 and `m` being greater than 0.
