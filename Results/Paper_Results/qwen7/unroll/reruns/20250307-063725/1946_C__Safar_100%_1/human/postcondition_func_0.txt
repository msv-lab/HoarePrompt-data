The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, then performs a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved by removing up to `k` edges. The function prints the result of this binary search, which indicates the maximum number of connected components possible after removing the edges.
