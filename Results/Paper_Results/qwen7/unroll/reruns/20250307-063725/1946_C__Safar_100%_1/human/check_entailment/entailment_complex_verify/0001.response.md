### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure we cover all aspects and confirm the correctness of the program.

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The program correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree using the `edges` provided.
   - The `func_1` function aims to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges, each connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The binary search approach in `func_1` is used to efficiently find the maximum \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is performed between 1 and \( n // k \).
   - For each midpoint value `mid`, the `check` function is called to verify if it is possible to achieve the desired condition with at least `mid` vertices per component.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of components that meet the criteria.
   - It maintains a dictionary `d` to keep track of the size of each subtree.
   - If the size of any subtree is less than `A` (the current midpoint), it increments the component counter `r`.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of components is greater than or equal to \( k \) and the root component size is at least `A`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the sum of \( n \) not exceeding \( 10^5 \).
   - The input validation and processing steps are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Detailed Verification:

- **Tree Construction**: The adjacency list `g` is correctly built from the input edges.
- **Binary Search**: The binary search in `func_1` correctly narrows down the possible values of \( x \) by checking the feasibility using the `check` function.
- **DFS Traversal**: The `check` function performs a DFS to count the number of components and their sizes, ensuring that the conditions are met.
- **Output**: The final output is the maximum \( x \) found by the binary search, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

Given that the program correctly implements the required logic and adheres to the problem constraints, the program is indeed correct.
