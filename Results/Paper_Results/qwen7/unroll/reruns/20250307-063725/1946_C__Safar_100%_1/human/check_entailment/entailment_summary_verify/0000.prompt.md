You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
    if r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k):
        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `check(A)` accepts an integer `A` and an adjacency list `g` representing a tree. It returns `True` if removing `k` edges from the tree results in all remaining connected components having at least `A` nodes. Otherwise, it returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `check` function does not accurately determine whether it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Range**: The binary search range `l` and `r` are set to `1` and `n // k`, respectively. However, the actual range for `A` should be between `1` and `n`, as the minimum size of a connected component cannot be larger than `n`.

2. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function attempts to verify if it is possible to achieve a certain value of `A`. However, the logic inside the function is flawed:
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach but does not properly account for the removal of edges.
   - The function does not correctly handle the condition of removing exactly `k` edges.
   - The function does not ensure that after removing the edges, the remaining components meet the size requirement.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 1
  1 2
  1 3
  3 4
  3 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: `2`

However, the current implementation might fail to correctly determine the maximum value of `x` because it does not properly simulate the edge removal process and check the resulting component sizes.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
