### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The annotated program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases (`t`) and then processing each test case individually. This ensures that the program can handle the input format as described.

2. **Graph Construction**: The program constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. This is done correctly in the `func_1` function.

3. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**: The program uses binary search to find the maximum size `x` of the connected components after removing `k` edges. The binary search is performed in the `func_1` function, and the `check` function is used to verify if a given size `A` is feasible.

4. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function correctly simulates the removal of edges and checks if the resulting components meet the required size constraints. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the graph and count the number of components that meet the size requirement.

5. **Output**: The program prints the maximum size `x` for each test case, which is determined by the binary search process.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or issues in the provided code.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
