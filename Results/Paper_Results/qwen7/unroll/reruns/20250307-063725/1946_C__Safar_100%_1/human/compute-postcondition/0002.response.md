Output State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1); `visited` is an empty set; `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}**.

The code `d = {(1): 1}` creates a dictionary `d` with a single key-value pair where the key is `1` and the value is `1`. This dictionary is initialized with this specific key-value pair, and no other changes are made to the `stack` or `visited` variables.
