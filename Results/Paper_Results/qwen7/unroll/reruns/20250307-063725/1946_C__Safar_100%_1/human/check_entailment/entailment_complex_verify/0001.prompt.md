You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Annotated Code: 
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: Output State: `g` is a list of lists where each element at index i (from 0 to n) contains its adjacent vertices (connected nodes) after adding all the edges specified in `edges`. Each vertex i is connected bidirectionally to its adjacent vertices.
    c = 0
    l = 1

        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: c is 0, g remains as a list of lists with each element containing its adjacent vertices, l and r are determined by the binary search process within the loop, and check(mid) is the result of the condition evaluated during the loop's execution.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: r (where r is the right bound determined by the binary search process)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree, then performs a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components that can be achieved by removing up to `k` edges. The function prints the result of this binary search, which indicates the maximum number of connected components possible after removing the edges.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where g[x] is a list of nodes connected to node x.
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {(1): 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        x, p = stack[-1]
        
        if x not in visited:

            for node in g[x]:

    #State: Output State: `stack` is an empty list; `visited` is a set containing {1}; `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}; `r` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to execute until it encounters the condition `if x == 1: break`, which happens when `x` becomes 1. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current `x` value is already in the `visited` set. If not, it adds `x` to `visited`, updates the dictionary `d` with `d[x] = 1`, and pushes nodes connected to `x` (excluding its parent `p`) onto the `stack`. If `x` is already in `visited`, it checks the value of `d[x]`. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, it increments `r`; otherwise, it updates `d[p]` with `d[x]` and then pops `x` from the `stack`, removes `x` from `visited`, and deletes `x` from `d`. Since the loop eventually breaks when `x` is 1, the final states of the variables are as described.
    if (r > k or d[1] >= A and r == k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `stack` is an empty list; `visited` is a set containing {1}; `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}; `r` is 0. Additionally, either `r` is less than or equal to `k`, or `d[1]` is less than `A` and `r` is equal to `k`.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `check(A)` accepts an integer `A` and an adjacency list `g` representing a tree. It returns `True` if removing `k` edges from the tree results in all remaining connected components having at least `A` nodes. Otherwise, it returns `False`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The program correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - The `func_1` function aims to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges, each connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The binary search approach in `func_1` is used to efficiently find the maximum \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is performed between 1 and \( n // k \).
   - For each midpoint value `mid`, the `check` function is called to verify if it is possible to achieve the desired condition with at least `mid` vertices per component.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of components that meet the criteria.
   - It maintains a dictionary `d` to keep track of the size of each subtree.
   - If the size of any subtree is less than `A` (the current midpoint), it increments the component counter `r`.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of components is greater than or equal to \( k \) and the root component size is at least `A`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the sum of \( n \) not exceeding \( 10^5 \).
   - The input validation and processing steps are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` and `check` functions aligns with the problem statement.
- The binary search approach ensures that the solution is efficient and correct within the given constraints.
- The DFS traversal in `check` accurately counts the number of components and their sizes.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the required logic and adheres to the problem constraints, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
