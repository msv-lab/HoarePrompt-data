Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `check` function does not accurately determine whether it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Range**: The binary search range `l` and `r` are set to `1` and `n // k`, respectively. However, the actual range for `A` should be between `1` and `n`, as the minimum size of a connected component cannot be larger than `n`.

2. **Check Function Logic**: The `check` function attempts to verify if it is possible to achieve a certain value of `A`. However, the logic inside the function is flawed:
   - It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach but does not properly account for the removal of edges.
   - The function does not correctly handle the condition of removing exactly `k` edges.
   - The function does not ensure that after removing the edges, the remaining components meet the size requirement.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  5 1
  1 2
  1 3
  3 4
  3 5
  ```

- **Expected Output**: `2`

However, the current implementation might fail to correctly determine the maximum value of `x` because it does not properly simulate the edge removal process and check the resulting component sizes.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, leading to incorrect results for some inputs.
