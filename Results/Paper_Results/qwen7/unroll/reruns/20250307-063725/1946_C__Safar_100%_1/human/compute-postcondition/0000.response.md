Output State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1)**.

Explanation: The code initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. This tuple is added to the stack, and no other changes are made to any variables. Therefore, the only updated information is that the `stack` now contains this single tuple.
