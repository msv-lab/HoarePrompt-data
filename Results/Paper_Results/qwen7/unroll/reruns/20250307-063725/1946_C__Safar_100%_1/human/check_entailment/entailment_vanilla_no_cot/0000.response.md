Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to solve the problem using binary search to find the maximum value \( x \). However, the implementation of the `check` function is flawed and does not correctly determine whether it's possible to partition the tree after removing \( k \) edges such that each connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Binary Search Range**: The range for binary search is set to `1` to `n // k`. While this might seem reasonable, it doesn't guarantee correctness. The correct range should consider the minimum and maximum possible sizes of connected components after removing \( k \) edges.

2. **Check Function Logic**:
   - The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach but does not properly handle the removal of edges.
   - The function `check(A)` aims to verify if the tree can be split into components of at least size \( A \), but it does not simulate the actual removal of edges.
   - The logic inside the `check` function does not correctly simulate the removal of edges and the resulting connected components.

3. **Edge Removal Simulation**: The problem requires simulating the removal of exactly \( k \) edges and checking the sizes of the resulting connected components. The current implementation does not simulate this process accurately.

To fix the solution, you would need to:
- Simulate the removal of edges and check the sizes of the resulting components.
- Ensure the binary search range is correctly defined and the `check` function properly verifies the conditions.

Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    
    def dfs(node, parent, size):
        count = 1
        for child in g[node]:
            if child != parent:
                count += dfs(child, node, size)
        return count
    
    l, r = 1, n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if dfs(1, -1, mid) <= k:
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    return r

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n - 1)]
    print(func_1(n, k, edges))
```

This revised solution uses DFS to count the number of nodes in subtrees and performs binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
