The function `check` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function also takes an adjacency list representation of a tree `g`, where `g[x]` is a list of nodes connected to node `x`.

The function returns `True` if the condition regarding the minimum size of each remaining connected component is met after removing k edges; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `A` and an adjacency list `g` representing a tree. It returns `True` if removing k edges from the tree results in all remaining connected components having at least `A` nodes. Otherwise, it returns `False`.**
