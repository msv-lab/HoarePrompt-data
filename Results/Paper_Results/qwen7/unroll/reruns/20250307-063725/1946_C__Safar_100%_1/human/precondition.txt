t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (v, u) represents an edge in the tree connecting vertices v and u (1 ≤ v, u ≤ n). Additionally, the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5.
