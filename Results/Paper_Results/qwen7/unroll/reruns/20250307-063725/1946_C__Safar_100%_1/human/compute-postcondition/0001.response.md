Output State: **`stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1); `visited` is an empty set**

The initial state of `stack` is a list containing one tuple (1, 1). The code initializes `visited` as an empty set. No changes are made to the `stack` list, so it remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated `visited` set and the unchanged `stack`.
