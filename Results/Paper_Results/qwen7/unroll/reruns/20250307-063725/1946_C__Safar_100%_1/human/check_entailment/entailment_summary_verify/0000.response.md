### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summaries step-by-step to validate or challenge the original assessment.

#### Problem Analysis:
The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that by removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, we can ensure that each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Given Code:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Initializes an adjacency list `g` from the input edges.
   - Uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - Calls `check(mid)` to determine if it is possible to remove \( k \) edges such that each remaining component has at least `mid` vertices.

2. **Function 2 (`check`)**:
   - Uses DFS to explore the tree.
   - Tracks the size of each component and counts how many components have at least `A` vertices.
   - Returns `True` if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that all remaining components have at least `A` vertices.

#### Function Summary:
- The `check` function correctly checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices.

#### Binary Search Range:
- The binary search range `l` and `r` are set to `1` and `n // k`, respectively.
- This range is actually correct because the smallest possible value for \( x \) is `1` and the largest possible value is `n // k` (since removing \( k \) edges can at most split the tree into \( k+1 \) components).

#### Check Function Logic:
- The `check` function uses DFS to explore the tree and count the number of components with at least `A` vertices.
- It correctly handles the condition of removing exactly `k` edges by ensuring that the number of components is exactly `k+1`.
- If the number of components is greater than `k`, it means we can remove more than `k` edges, which is not allowed.
- If the number of components is exactly `k+1` and each component has at least `A` vertices, then it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges to achieve the desired result.

Given these points, the original assessment is incorrect. The provided solution correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The binary search range is correct, and the `check` function accurately determines if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining component has at least `A` vertices.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summaries provided.
