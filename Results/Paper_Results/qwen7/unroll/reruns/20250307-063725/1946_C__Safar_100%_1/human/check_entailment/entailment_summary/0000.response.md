Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic of the provided functions and ensure they meet the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the maximum number of connected components (`mid`) that can be achieved by removing up to `k` edges.
   - The `check` function is used within the binary search to verify if removing `k` edges can result in connected components of at least `mid` nodes.

2. **Function `check`**:
   - This function checks if removing `k` edges can result in all remaining connected components having at least `A` nodes.
   - It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of connected components that meet the size requirement.
   - If the number of such components is greater than `k`, or if the largest component is at least `A` and the total number of components equals `k`, it returns `True`.

Given the problem statement and the execution summaries:
- The binary search in `func_1` correctly narrows down the maximum possible value of `x`.
- The `check` function accurately determines whether the condition of having at least `A` nodes in each component after removing `k` edges is met.

Since both functions work together to solve the problem as described, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
