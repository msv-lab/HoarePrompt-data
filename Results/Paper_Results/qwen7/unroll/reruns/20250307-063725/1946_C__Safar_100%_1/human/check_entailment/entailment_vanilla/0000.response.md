Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The program correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - The `func_1` function aims to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges, each connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The binary search approach in `func_1` is used to efficiently find the maximum \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is performed between 1 and \( n // k \).
   - For each midpoint value `mid`, the `check` function is called to verify if it is possible to achieve the desired condition with at least `mid` vertices per component.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of components that meet the criteria.
   - It maintains a dictionary `d` to keep track of the size of each subtree.
   - If the size of any subtree is less than `A` (the current midpoint), it increments the component counter `r`.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of components is greater than or equal to \( k \) and the root component size is at least `A`.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, including the sum of \( n \) not exceeding \( 10^5 \).
   - The input validation and processing steps are consistent with the problem requirements.

### Verification:
- The logic in `func_1` and `check` functions aligns with the problem statement.
- The binary search approach ensures that the solution is efficient and correct within the given constraints.
- The DFS traversal in `check` accurately counts the number of components and their sizes.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the required logic and adheres to the problem constraints, the program is correct.
