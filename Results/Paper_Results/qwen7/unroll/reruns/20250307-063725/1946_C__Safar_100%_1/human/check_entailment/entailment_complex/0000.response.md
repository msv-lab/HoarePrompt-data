### Reasoning:

1. **Binary Search Functionality**: 
   - The `func_1` function uses binary search to determine the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and have each remaining connected component contain at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The binary search is performed between \( l = 1 \) and \( r = n // k \). The midpoint \( mid \) is calculated, and the `check` function is called to verify if it is possible to achieve \( x \geq mid \).

2. **Check Functionality**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to determine if the tree can be split into components of at least \( A \) vertices after removing \( k \) edges.
   - The DFS uses a stack to traverse the tree and keeps track of visited nodes and their sizes using the dictionary `d`.
   - The function returns `True` if the number of components \( r \) is greater than \( k \) or if the root node's component size \( d[1] \) is at least \( A \) and the number of components is exactly \( k \).
   - The function returns `False` otherwise.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The binary search ensures that the solution space is explored efficiently.
   - The `check` function correctly handles the conditions for splitting the tree into the required components.

4. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The main loop reads the input and calls `func_1` for each set of input data.
   - `func_1` constructs the graph and performs the binary search, ensuring that the output is the maximum possible \( x \).

Given the detailed analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly implements the binary search and DFS to solve the problem as described.
- All functions work together to provide the correct output.

### Correctness:
**True**
