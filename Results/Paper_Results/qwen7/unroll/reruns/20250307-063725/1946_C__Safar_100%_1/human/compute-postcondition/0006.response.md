Output State: `stack` is an empty list; `visited` is a set containing {1}; `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}; `r` is 0.

Explanation: The loop continues to execute until it encounters the condition `if x == 1: break`, which happens when `x` becomes 1. During each iteration, the loop checks if the current `x` value is already in the `visited` set. If not, it adds `x` to `visited`, updates the dictionary `d` with `d[x] = 1`, and pushes nodes connected to `x` (excluding its parent `p`) onto the `stack`. If `x` is already in `visited`, it checks the value of `d[x]`. If `d[x]` is greater than or equal to `A`, it increments `r`; otherwise, it updates `d[p]` with `d[x]` and then pops `x` from the `stack`, removes `x` from `visited`, and deletes `x` from `d`. Since the loop eventually breaks when `x` is 1, the final states of the variables are as described.
