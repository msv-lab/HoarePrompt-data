Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is incorrect because it should start with the first sign's period.
4. The loop calculates the `start_year` for each sign by ensuring that the current `start_year` is a multiple of the next sign's period. This logic is correct and ensures that the signs occur sequentially.
5. The final `start_year` is printed for each test case, which is the correct output.

However, the initialization of `start_year` to 0 is problematic because it does not account for the first sign occurring at its initial period. To fix this, `start_year` should be initialized to the first element of `nums`.

Given these points, the program is almost correct but needs a minor adjustment in the initialization of `start_year`.

Correctness: **False**
