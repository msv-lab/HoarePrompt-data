Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the year in which all n signs will occur sequentially. The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities directly, which does not account for the sequential nature of the signs occurring. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
The correct year for the nth sign to occur would be 36, as explained in the problem description. However, the program incorrectly calculates the LCM of the periodicities, which results in the wrong year. 

To fix this, the program needs to iteratively calculate the next occurrence year for each sign based on the previous sign's occurrence year, ensuring the signs occur sequentially.
