Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `num_tests` is not known, but it is constrained to be between 1 and 1000. The other variables (`t` and the list of integers) remain in their initial state, meaning `t` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, and no list of integers has been defined yet.
