Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.**

Explanation: For each test case (`num_tests`), the code calculates the value of `start_year` based on the input list `nums`. The value of `start_year` is determined by the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each element in `nums`, starting from `x=0` to `x=len(nums)-1`. After processing all test cases, the output will contain one result per line corresponding to each test case.
