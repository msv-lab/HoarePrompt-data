Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the loop where `start_year` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect for this problem. This line attempts to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` greater than `start_year`, but it doesn't correctly handle the sequential waiting period between signs.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to iteratively update the `start_year` based on the current value of `start_year` and the next periodicity in the list. Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(n):
            start_year += (nums[x] - start_year % nums[x]) % nums[x]
        print(start_year)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- For each sign, we calculate how much more time needs to be waited until the next occurrence of that sign, starting from `start_year`.
- We use the expression `(nums[x] - start_year % nums[x]) % nums[x]` to find the difference between the current `start_year` and the next occurrence of the sign.
- We add this difference to `start_year` to get the new `start_year` for the next sign.
- This process is repeated for all signs, ensuring that the waiting periods are handled correctly.
