Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers based on the given constraints. It returns a result based on the list of integers provided for each test case where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) followed by n integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) each between 1 and 10^6.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function processes these inputs according to the specified ranges and returns a result based on the provided data.
