Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the given periodicities. The program correctly processes multiple test cases and calculates the starting year for each test case. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Periodicity Calculation**: For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_i`.
3. **Year Calculation**: It initializes `start_year` to 0 and iterates through the periodicities. For each periodicity `a_i`, it updates `start_year` to the next multiple of `a_i` after `start_year`. This ensures that the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the sign strictly after the previous one has occurred.
4. **Output**: The program prints the final `start_year` for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program logic aligns with the requirement to find the year when all signs occur sequentially. The approach used in the program is correct and should produce the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
