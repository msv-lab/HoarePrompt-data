### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`).
3. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to keep track of the current year in which the last sign occurred.
4. **Loop Through Periodicities**: The program iterates over the list of periodicities (`nums`). For each periodicity, it updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the sign by calculating `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
   - **Calculation Explanation**: 
     - `start_year // nums[x]` gives the largest integer `k` such that `k * nums[x] <= start_year`.
     - Adding 1 to this value gives the smallest integer `k + 1` such that `(k + 1) * nums[x] > start_year`.
     - Multiplying by `nums[x]` gives the next occurrence of the sign.
5. **Output**: After processing all periodicities, the program prints the final value of `start_year`.

However, there is a flaw in the logic used to update `start_year`. Specifically, the expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not always give the correct next occurrence of the sign. Instead, it should be updated using the maximum of the current `start_year` and the next occurrence of the sign.

### Corrected Logic:
To find the next occurrence of the sign, we need to use the maximum of the current `start_year` and the next occurrence of the sign, which can be calculated as `max(start_year, k * nums[x])` where `k` is the smallest integer such that `k * nums[x] > start_year`.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            # Find the next occurrence of the sign
            next_occurrence = max(start_year, (start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] * nums[x])
            start_year = next_occurrence
        print(start_year)
```

### Conclusion:
The original code has a logical error in updating `start_year`. The corrected logic ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next occurrence of the sign correctly.

**Correctness: False**
