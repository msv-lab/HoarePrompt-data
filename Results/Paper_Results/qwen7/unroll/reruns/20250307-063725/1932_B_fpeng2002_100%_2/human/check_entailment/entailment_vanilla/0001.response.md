### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when all `n` signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a_i`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list of periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

3. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - This ensures that we are finding the next occurrence of the sign after the last sign occurred.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the loop correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign.
   - The formula ensures that the year is updated to the next multiple of the current periodicity, which aligns with the requirement of waiting for the next sign after the previous one.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - The initial value of `start_year` being 0 is appropriate since we start from the beginning.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final `start_year` for each test case, which is the year when all signs occur.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
