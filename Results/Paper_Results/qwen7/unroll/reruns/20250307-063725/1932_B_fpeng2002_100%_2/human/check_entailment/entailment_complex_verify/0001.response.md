### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when all `n` signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign can only occur after the previous one.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and their periodicities `a_i`.
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through the list of periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.

3. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is used to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - This ensures that we are finding the next occurrence of the sign after the last sign occurred.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the loop correctly calculates the next occurrence of each sign.
   - However, the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not always correctly compute the next multiple of `nums[x]` after `start_year`. Specifically, it does not handle cases where `start_year` is already a multiple of `nums[x]`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Consider the test case where `nums = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`:
     - Initially, `start_year = 0`.
     - After the first iteration (with `a_1 = 3`), `start_year` becomes 3.
     - After the second iteration (with `a_2 = 2`), `start_year` becomes 4 (instead of 6).
     - After the third iteration (with `a_3 = 4`), `start_year` becomes 8 (instead of 12).
     - After the fourth iteration (with `a_4 = 5`), `start_year` becomes 10 (instead of 15).
     - After the fifth iteration (with `a_5 = 9`), `start_year` becomes 18 (instead of 27).
     - After the sixth iteration (with `a_6 = 18`), `start_year` becomes 36.
   - The issue arises because the formula does not account for the fact that `start_year` might already be a multiple of `nums[x]`, leading to incorrect results.

6. **Output:**
   - The program prints the final `start_year` for each test case, but due to the incorrect formula, the results are not accurate.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the year when all signs occur sequentially. The formula used to update `start_year` does not always yield the correct next multiple of `nums[x]`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
