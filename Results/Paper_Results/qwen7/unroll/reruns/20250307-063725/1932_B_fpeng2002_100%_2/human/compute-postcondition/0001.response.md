The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. If `num_tests` is greater than 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq \text{num_tests} \leq 1000\). Since the loop condition is `num_tests > 0`, and given that `num_tests` is guaranteed to be at least 1, no adjustment is necessary because the loop can certainly execute the first time.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 â‰¤ `num_tests` â‰¤ 1000**
