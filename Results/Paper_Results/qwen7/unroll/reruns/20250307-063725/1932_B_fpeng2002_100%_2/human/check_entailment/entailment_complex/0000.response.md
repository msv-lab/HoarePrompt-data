Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually. This ensures that the program can handle multiple test cases as specified.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`). This ensures that the program correctly understands the input format.

3. **Calculating Start Year**: The key part of the program is the loop where it calculates the `start_year`. The loop iterates over the periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula effectively finds the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities up to the current point, ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one has occurred.

4. **Output**: The program prints the calculated `start_year` for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.

Given that the program correctly handles the input, processes the data according to the problem requirements, and produces the expected output, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
