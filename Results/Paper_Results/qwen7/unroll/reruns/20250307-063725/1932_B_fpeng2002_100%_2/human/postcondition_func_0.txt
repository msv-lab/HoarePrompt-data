The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a starting year (`start_year`) based on the given integers using a specific formula and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs a list of these calculated starting years, one for each test case.
