Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer `n`, and `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of the sequence starting from 1000 and prints the results as space-separated strings. The function does not return any value but outputs the cumulative sums for all test cases.**
