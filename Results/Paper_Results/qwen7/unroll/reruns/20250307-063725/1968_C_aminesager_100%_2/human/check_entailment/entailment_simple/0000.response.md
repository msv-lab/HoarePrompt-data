Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array `a` such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution initializes `a` with a value of 1000 for the first element and then iteratively constructs the rest of the array by adding the corresponding `x_i` value to the previous element in the array.
3. This approach ensures that \(a_i > a_{i-1}\), which is necessary for the modulo operation to yield the correct `x_i` value.
4. The constructed array `a` will satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) because \(a_i\) is always greater than \(a_{i-1}\) and the difference between consecutive elements is exactly the corresponding `x_i` value.
5. The output format matches the requirement of printing the array elements separated by spaces.

Given the above points, the provided solution correctly constructs the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
