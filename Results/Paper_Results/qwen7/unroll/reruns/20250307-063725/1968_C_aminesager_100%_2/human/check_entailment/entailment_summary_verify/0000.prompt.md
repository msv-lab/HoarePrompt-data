You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input('')
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        a = [1000]
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] + T[i - 1])
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer `n`, and `n-1` integers `x_2, ..., x_n`. For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of the sequence starting from 1000 and prints the results as space-separated strings. The function does not return any value but outputs the cumulative sums for all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate the array `a` that satisfies the given conditions. Specifically, the logic used to construct `a` is flawed. Let's consider the following example:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```

The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2\)
- \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4\)
- \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1\)

The current implementation constructs `a` as follows:
- `a[0] = 1000`
- `a[1] = a[0] + T[0] = 1000 + 2 = 1002`
- `a[2] = a[1] + T[1] = 1002 + 4 = 1006`
- `a[3] = a[2] + T[2] = 1006 + 1 = 1007`

However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
- \(1002 \bmod 1000 = 2\) (correct)
- \(1006 \bmod 1002 = 4\) (incorrect, should be 4, but is 4)
- \(1007 \bmod 1006 = 1\) (correct)

The issue lies in the way `a` is being constructed. Instead of adding the value from `T` directly to the previous element in `a`, we need to ensure that the modulo condition is satisfied. A correct approach would involve setting `a[i]` to a value that satisfies the condition \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).

For instance, a correct solution could set:
- \(a_1 = 1000\)
- \(a_2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002\)
- \(a_3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006\)
- \(a_4 = 1006 + 1 = 1007\)

But this still doesn't satisfy the modulo conditions properly. A better approach would be to set:
- \(a_1 = 1000\)
- \(a_2 = 1000 + 2 = 1002\)
- \(a_3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006\)
- \(a_4 = 1006 + 1 = 1007\)

And then adjust \(a_3\) to satisfy the condition \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4\), which would require \(a_3 = 1002 + 4 = 1006\).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly generate the array `a` for all potential cases, hence the correctness is **False**.
