Output State: **The output state will be a series of lists, each representing the cumulative sum up to that point for each input line, formatted as strings.**

Explanation: The loop continues until `t` becomes 0. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a line of space-separated integers `T`. It then constructs a list `a` where each element is the cumulative sum of the first `i` elements from `T`, starting with 1000 as the first element. After processing all lines, it prints each list `a` as a space-separated string. Since `t` can be any integer between 1 and 10^4, the output will consist of up to 10^4 such lists, each derived from the respective input line.
