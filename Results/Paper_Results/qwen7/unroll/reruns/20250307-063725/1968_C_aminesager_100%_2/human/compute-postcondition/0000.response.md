Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and now `t` is set to the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` holds the specific integer value entered by the user. All other preconditions and variables remain unchanged.
