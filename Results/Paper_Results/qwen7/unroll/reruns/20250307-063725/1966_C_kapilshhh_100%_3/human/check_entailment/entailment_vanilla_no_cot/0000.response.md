Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of the game. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach (`dp`) that doesn't accurately reflect the game's rules. Specifically, it checks whether `arr[i] - arr[i + 1] > 1` or not, which is not relevant to the game's outcome. This logic does not correctly simulate the game's state transitions.

2. **Game Theory Insight**: This game is actually a classic example of the Nim game variant where the winning strategy can be determined using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

3. **Correct Implementation**: To solve this problem correctly, you should compute the XOR of all pile sizes and check if the result is zero. If it is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile_size in arr:
            xor_sum ^= pile_size
        print('Alice' if xor_sum != 0 else 'Bob')
        tc -= 1
```

This implementation correctly determines the winner based on the XOR of the pile sizes.
