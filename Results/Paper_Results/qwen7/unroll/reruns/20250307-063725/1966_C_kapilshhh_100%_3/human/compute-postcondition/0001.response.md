Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `tc`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`. This means that for the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: The current state before the loop is that `tc` is an input integer.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since `tc` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `tc` meets this condition.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `tc` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
