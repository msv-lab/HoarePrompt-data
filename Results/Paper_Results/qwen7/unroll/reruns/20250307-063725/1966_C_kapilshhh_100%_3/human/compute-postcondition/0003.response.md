Output State: The output state will consist of a series of names ('Alice' or 'Bob') printed based on the conditions within the loop for each test case.

Each iteration of the loop processes one test case. For each test case, the loop first reads an integer `n`, which is the length of the array. Then it reads a space-separated list of integers, converts them to a set to remove duplicates, sorts them in descending order, and appends a zero. It then initializes a boolean variable `dp` to `True`. The loop iterates through the array (excluding the last element), checking if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1 or if `dp` is `False`. If either condition is met, `dp` remains `True`; otherwise, it becomes `False`. Finally, it prints 'Alice' if `dp` is `True`, and 'Bob' otherwise, before decrementing `tc`.

The output state will be a sequence of 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case, depending on the input arrays provided for each test case.
