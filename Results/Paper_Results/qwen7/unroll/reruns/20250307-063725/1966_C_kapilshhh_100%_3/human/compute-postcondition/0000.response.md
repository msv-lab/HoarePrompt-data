Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and it represents the number of test cases. All other variables retain their initial states.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tc`). This integer is converted to an integer type using `int()`. Since no other variables are mentioned or modified in this line of code, the initial states of `t`, `n`, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
