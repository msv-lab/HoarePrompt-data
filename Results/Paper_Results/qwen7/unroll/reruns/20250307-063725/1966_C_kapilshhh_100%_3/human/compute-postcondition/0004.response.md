Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (number of piles), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it returns information about the distribution of stones across the piles.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of parameters related to the number of test cases, the number of piles, and the initial number of stones in each pile. The function processes these inputs and provides output based on the given constraints and relationships between the parameters.
