Output State: The output state will consist of a series of names printed, either "Alice" or "Bob", each corresponding to the result of one iteration of the loop based on the input provided during that iteration.

To elaborate, for each test case (`tc`), the program reads an integer `n` and a list of integers from the user. It then sorts the unique elements of the list in descending order and appends a zero. The program checks if the difference between consecutive elements (except the last one) is greater than 1 or if the previous value of `dp` was False. If the condition is met, `dp` remains True; otherwise, it becomes False. After processing all elements, it prints "Alice" if `dp` is True, otherwise "Bob". This process repeats for each test case until `tc` becomes 0.
