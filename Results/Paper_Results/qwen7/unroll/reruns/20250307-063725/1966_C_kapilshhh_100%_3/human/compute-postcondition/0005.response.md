Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (number of piles), and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins based on the distribution of stones across the piles. Specifically, it sorts the list of stones in descending order, removes duplicates, and checks if the difference between any two consecutive stones is greater than 1 or if a certain condition (`dp`) is false. If the condition holds true, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Bob'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
