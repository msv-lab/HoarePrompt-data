Output State: **The variable `start` will be equal to the length of `nums`, the set `vis` will contain all indices from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, and the list `nums` will have all its elements decremented such that any index that was part of the path traced by `start` will have its value reduced by the number of times it was visited.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues as long as there is a non-zero value at `nums[start]`.
- During each iteration, `start`'s value is added to the set `vis`, indicating that `start` has been visited.
- `nums[start]` is decremented by 1.
- If `nums[start + 1]` is non-zero, then `start` is incremented by 1, moving to the next index.
- If `nums[start + 1]` is zero, the program prints `start + 1` and returns, ending the loop.

After all iterations, `start` will be equal to the length of `nums`, meaning it has traversed all possible indices. The set `vis` will contain all indices from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, as every index has been visited at least once. The list `nums` will have its elements decremented based on how many times their respective indices were visited during the loop.
