Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Game Logic Misunderstanding**: The program attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the list `arr`, which is not equivalent to finding the MEX of the array `c`. The MEX is calculated after Alice and Bob have played their turns, and the elements are moved to `c`.

2. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` tries to find the smallest integer not present in the sequence starting from 0, but this is not relevant to the game. In the game, Alice and Bob are appending and deleting elements from different arrays (`a` and `c`), and the MEX is determined by the final state of `c`.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The problem requires understanding the optimal moves for both players. The provided code does not simulate the game turns or account for the strategic choices made by Alice and Bob.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
