### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who play a game on an array `a`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Alice always picks an element from `a` and appends it to `c`.
   - Bob always picks an element from `a` directly and removes it.
   - The game ends when `a` is empty.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice should aim to include as many unique numbers as possible in `c` to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should aim to prevent Alice from including certain numbers in `c`.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not match the problem description. It includes unnecessary functions like `build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, and `dfs`, which are not used in solving the problem.
   - The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem using a counter (`c.Counter`) to track the frequency of elements in `arr`. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed.

5. **Flawed Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the array, trying to find the smallest missing number. This approach is incorrect because it does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the game turns. It assumes that Alice and Bob can pick elements in a specific order, which is not the case.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice should try to include all numbers from 0 to `n-1` in `c` if possible.
   - Bob should remove numbers that Alice tries to include.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice picking numbers that are not already in `c` and ensuring that Bob cannot prevent her from doing so.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the game logic and does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
