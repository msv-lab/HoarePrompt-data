### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play a game on an array `a` of size `n`.
   - Alice picks elements from `a` and appends them to `c`, while Bob removes elements from `a` without adding them to `c`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`.
   - Bob aims to minimize the MEX of `c`.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Alice can ensure that the MEX of `c` is at least 2 by ensuring that the numbers 0 and 1 are not present in `c`.
   - If there are no duplicates in `a`, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, Alice can strategically pick elements to avoid having 0 and 1 in `c`.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - The while loop attempts to find the smallest number that is not in `vis`, but it does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Alice should aim to ensure that 0 and 1 are not in `c`.
   - If there are no duplicates, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, Alice can pick elements to avoid having 0 and 1 in `c`.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - Check if there are any duplicates in `a`.
   - If there are no duplicates, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, the MEX will be 2 because Alice can ensure that 0 and 1 are not in `c`.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` attempts to find the smallest missing integer in the list `arr` using a `Counter` and a while loop.
   - However, the logic does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.

8. **Evaluation**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value.
   - The while loop in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game's turns and does not account for the optimal strategy where Alice ensures that 0 and 1 are not in `c`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
