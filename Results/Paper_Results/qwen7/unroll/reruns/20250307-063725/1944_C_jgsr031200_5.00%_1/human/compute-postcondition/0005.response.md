Based on the initial state described:

- `start` will be equal to the length of `nums`.
- The set `vis` will contain all indices from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1.
- The list `nums` will have all its elements decremented such that any index that was part of the path traced by `start` will have its value reduced by the number of times it was visited.

When the `print(start)` statement is executed, it will print the length of the list `nums`.

Output: **the length of nums**
