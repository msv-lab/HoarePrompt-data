#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of non-negative integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(0 \le a_i < n\) and the length of the list is \(n\) (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5).
def func_1(arr):
    nums = c.Counter(arr)
    start = 0
    vis = set()
    while nums.get(start, 0):
        vis.add(start)
        
        nums[start] -= 1
        
        if nums.get(start + 1, 0):
            nums[start + 1] -= 1
            start += 1
        else:
            print(start + 1)
            return
        
    #State: The variable `start` will be equal to the length of `nums`, the set `vis` will contain all indices from 0 to the length of `nums` - 1, and the list `nums` will have all its elements decremented such that any index that was part of the path traced by `start` will have its value reduced by the number of times it was visited.
    print(start)
    #This is printed: the length of nums
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and returns either the length of the list or the smallest missing integer in the list. It constructs a counter for the list elements, iterates through the list to find a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0, and prints or returns the smallest integer not present in this sequence. If no such sequence exists, it prints and returns the length of the list.
