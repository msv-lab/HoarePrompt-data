### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - Alice and Bob play optimally on an array \(a\) to maximize and minimize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array \(c\).
   - Alice starts by picking elements from \(a\) and appending them to \(c\), and then deleting them from \(a\).
   - Bob removes elements from \(a\) without adding them to \(c\).
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of \(c\) after both players have played optimally.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice can ensure that the MEX of \(c\) is at least 2 by ensuring that the numbers 0 and 1 are not present in \(c\).
   - If there are no duplicates in \(a\), the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, Alice can strategically pick elements to avoid having 0 and 1 in \(c\).

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - The while loop attempts to find the smallest number that is not in `vis`, but it does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.
   - Specifically, the logic in the while loop is flawed because it does not properly handle the sequence of moves between Alice and Bob.

4. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs a counter for the list elements, iterates through the list to find a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0, and prints or returns the smallest integer not present in this sequence.
   - This function does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Alice should ensure that 0 and 1 are not in \(c\).
   - If there are no duplicates, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, Alice can pick elements to avoid having 0 and 1 in \(c\).

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - Check if there are any duplicates in \(a\).
   - If there are no duplicates, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, the MEX will be 2 because Alice can ensure that 0 and 1 are not in \(c\).

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value. The function `func_1` does not simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
