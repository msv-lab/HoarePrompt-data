Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, who manipulate an array `a` to form a new array `c`. Alice aims to maximize the MEX of `c`, while Bob aims to minimize it. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in `c`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several unused functions (`build_tree`, `bs`, `kadane`, `dfs`) which are irrelevant to the problem at hand.
   - The relevant part of the code is the `func_1` function, which processes the input array `arr` using a counter (`nums`) and a set (`vis`).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `nums = c.Counter(arr)` creates a counter object to count occurrences of each element in `arr`.
   - `start = 0` initializes the starting point for finding a sequence of consecutive integers.
   - A loop runs while there are still occurrences of `start` in `nums`:
     - `vis.add(start)` marks `start` as visited.
     - `nums[start] -= 1` decrements the count of `start` in the counter.
     - If `start + 1` is also in `nums`, it continues the sequence; otherwise, it breaks the loop.
   - Finally, it prints `start + 1` or the length of `nums` depending on whether a complete sequence was found.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is designed to find the smallest missing integer in the sequence formed by the elements of `arr`.
   - This approach correctly identifies the MEX of the array `c` formed by the game's rules, as it simulates the process of appending and removing elements to form `c`.
   - The function handles all edge cases, including when no sequence of consecutive integers can be formed.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the MEX of the array `c` formed by the game's rules.
   - Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
