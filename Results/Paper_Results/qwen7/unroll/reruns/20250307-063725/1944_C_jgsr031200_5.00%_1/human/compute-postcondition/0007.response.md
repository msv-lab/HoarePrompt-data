Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `arr` and returns either the length of the list or the smallest missing integer in the list. It constructs a counter for the list elements, iterates through the list to find a sequence of consecutive integers starting from 0, and prints or returns the smallest integer not present in this sequence. If no such sequence exists, it prints and returns the length of the list.**
