Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as required. Instead, it attempts to find the smallest missing number in the array `arr` by incrementing from 0 and checking if the number is present in the array. This approach does not account for the optimal strategies of both players.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
4
0 0 1 1
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program simply finds the smallest number that is not present in the array, without simulating the turns of Alice and Bob. In the optimal play scenario, Alice would pick elements to maximize the MEX, and Bob would pick elements to minimize it. The provided solution does not reflect these strategic choices.

A correct implementation would involve simulating the turns of Alice and Bob according to the rules, ensuring that Alice always picks an element that maximizes the MEX and Bob picks an element that minimizes it.
