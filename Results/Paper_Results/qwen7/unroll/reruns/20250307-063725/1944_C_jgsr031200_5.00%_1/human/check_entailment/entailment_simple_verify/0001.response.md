### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Alice and Bob, playing optimally on an array `a` to maximize and minimize the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array `c`. The key observation is that Alice can always pick elements in such a way that the MEX is maximized, and Bob will try to minimize it.

2. **Optimal Strategy Analysis**:
   - Alice starts by picking elements from `a` and appending them to `c`.
   - Bob removes elements from `a` without adding them to `c`.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` after both players have played optimally.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - Alice can ensure that the MEX of `c` is at least 2 by ensuring that the numbers 0 and 1 are not present in `c`.
   - If there are no duplicates in `a`, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, Alice can strategically pick elements to avoid having 0 and 1 in `c`.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each number in `arr`.
   - The while loop attempts to find the smallest number that is not in `vis`, but it does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Alice should aim to ensure that 0 and 1 are not in `c`.
   - If there are no duplicates, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, Alice can pick elements to avoid having 0 and 1 in `c`.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - Check if there are any duplicates in `a`.
   - If there are no duplicates, the MEX will be 1.
   - If there are duplicates, the MEX will be 2 because Alice can ensure that 0 and 1 are not in `c`.

7. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number that is not in the set `vis`.
   - However, the logic inside the while loop does not correctly simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.
   - The function prints `start + 1` if `start + 1` is not in `vis`, but it does not ensure that Alice and Bob play optimally.

8. **Final Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value.
   - The annotated code further confirms that the logic inside the while loop does not simulate the game's turns or account for the optimal strategy.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to determine the optimal MEX value. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

This conclusion aligns with the original assessment, so we do not need to overturn the original assessment.
