Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Misunderstanding the Game Rules**:
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, then delete it from `a`.
   - Bob can only pick an element from `a` and delete it.
   - The goal is to determine the MEX of `c` at the end of the game, considering both players play optimally.

2. **Incorrect Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to simulate the process of picking elements, but it does not correctly model the turns of Alice and Bob.
   - It also does not account for the fact that Alice can pick any element, including those picked by Bob, and the sequence of picks matters.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The code tries to find the smallest missing integer in the counter `nums`, but it does not simulate the game properly.
   - It assumes that the game ends when no more elements can be picked, which is not how the game is supposed to work.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game properly and consider the optimal moves for both players. Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Moves**:
   - Alice can always pick the smallest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob will pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.

2. **Track Picked Elements**:
   - Use a set to keep track of elements picked by both players.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Track picked elements
    picked = set()
    
    # Alice's turn: pick the smallest available element
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] not in picked:
            picked.add(arr[i])
    
    # Bob's turn: pick the smallest available element
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] not in picked:
            picked.add(arr[i])
    
    # Determine the MEX of the picked elements
    mex = 0
    while mex in picked:
        mex += 1
    
    print(mex)
```

This approach ensures that both players play optimally according to the rules of the game.
