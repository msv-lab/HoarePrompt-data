Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `start`.

2. **Understand the condition of the loop**: The loop condition is `nums.get(start, 0)`. This means that as long as `nums[start]` is not `None` (or any falsy value), the loop will continue.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `start` is 0.
   - `vis` is an empty set.

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `nums.get(start, 0)` must return a non-falsy value. Since `start` is currently 0, the condition becomes `nums.get(0, 0)`.
   - Therefore, `nums[0]` must not be `None` (or any falsy value).

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The current state is that `start` is 0 and `vis` is an empty set.
   - We need to ensure that `nums[0]` is not `None`.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `nums[0]` must not be `None`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is 0, `nums[0]` must not be None**
