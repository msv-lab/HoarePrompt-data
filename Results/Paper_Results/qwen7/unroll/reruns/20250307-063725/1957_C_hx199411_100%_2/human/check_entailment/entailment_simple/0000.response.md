Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k` along with `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Condition Check for Mirroring**: The program correctly checks if `c == r` for each move, incrementing `num` by 1 if true (indicating a diagonal move where mirroring is not possible) and by 2 otherwise (indicating a non-diagonal move where mirroring is possible).

3. **Calculation of Remaining Elements**: The variable `m` is correctly calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Calculation**:
   - The base cases for the dynamic programming array `dp` are correctly initialized (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is correctly implemented to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Output**: The program correctly handles the edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 by printing `1`. For other values of `m`, it uses the precomputed dynamic programming array to print the result.

Given the provided annotated program and the explanation, the logic and implementation appear to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
