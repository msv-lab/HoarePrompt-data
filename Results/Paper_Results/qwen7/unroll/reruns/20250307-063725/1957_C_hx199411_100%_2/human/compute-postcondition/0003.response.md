Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the input provided within the loop iterations. For each iteration, the program processes two inputs: `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `c` and `r`. It calculates `num` based on the conditions given and then determines `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `1` or proceeds to compute a dynamic programming array `dp` to print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The exact output values depend on the specific inputs provided for each iteration, but the general process is as follows:
- If `m` is 0 or 1, it prints `1`.
- Otherwise, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a certain state with `i` remaining elements, and prints `dp[m]`.

Since the initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and the loop runs exactly `t` times, the output will be a sequence of lines, each corresponding to one of these iterations. Each line will contain either `1` or a computed value from the dynamic programming array `dp`.
