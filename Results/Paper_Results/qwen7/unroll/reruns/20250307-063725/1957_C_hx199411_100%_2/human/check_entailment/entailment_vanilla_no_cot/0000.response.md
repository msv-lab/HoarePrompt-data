Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique positions that have been occupied by either a white or black rook. However, the current logic only increments `num` based on whether the row and column indices are equal or not. This is insufficient for counting unique positions correctly.

2. **Dynamic Programming Logic:**
   - The dynamic programming (DP) approach used in the solution is incorrect. The DP array `dp` is meant to store the number of ways to place rooks in a specific number of empty cells, but the transitions and calculations are not correct for this problem.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `(10 ** 9 + 7)` is applied correctly, but the base logic for calculating the number of configurations is flawed.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following:

- Each move reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
- The number of configurations depends on the number of unoccupied rows and columns after the initial moves.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        used_rows = set()
        used_cols = set()
        
        for _ in range(k):
            r, c = map(int, input().split())
            used_rows.add(r)
            used_cols.add(c)
        
        # Calculate the number of unused rows and columns
        unused_rows = n - len(used_rows)
        unused_cols = n - len(used_cols)
        
        # If there are no unused rows or columns, no more moves are possible
        if unused_rows == 0 or unused_cols == 0:
            print(1)
        else:
            # The number of configurations is the product of unused rows and columns
            print((unused_rows * unused_cols) % MOD)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of unused rows and columns after the initial moves and prints the number of possible configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
