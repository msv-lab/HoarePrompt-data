Reasoning:

1. The program correctly processes multiple test cases, reading `t` as the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then processes `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made by the player.
3. The program checks if the moves involve placing rooks on the same diagonal (`c == r`). If so, it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2.
4. The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining non-attacking positions.
5. The program handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 directly, printing 1 in those cases.
6. For larger values of `m`, the program uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions without attacking each other. The base cases and recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming approach are correct.
7. The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the detailed explanation and the execution summary, the program appears to follow the correct logic and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
