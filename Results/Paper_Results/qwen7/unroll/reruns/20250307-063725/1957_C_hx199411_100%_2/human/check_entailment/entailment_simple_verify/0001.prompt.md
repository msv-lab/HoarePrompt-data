You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the input provided within the loop iterations. For each iteration, the program processes two inputs: `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `c` and `r`. It calculates `num` based on the conditions given and then determines `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `1` or proceeds to compute a dynamic programming array `dp` to print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    #
    #The exact output values depend on the specific inputs provided for each iteration, but the general process is as follows:
    #- If `m` is 0 or 1, it prints `1`.
    #- Otherwise, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a certain state with `i` remaining elements, and prints `dp[m]`.
    #
    #Since the initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and the loop runs exactly `t` times, the output will be a sequence of lines, each corresponding to one of these iterations. Each line will contain either `1` or a computed value from the dynamic programming array `dp`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move involves placing a rook and the opponent mirroring the move.
   - The key points are:
     - Each move reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
     - If a move is mirrored (i.e., `c != r`), it results in 2 additional rooks being placed.
     - If a move is not mirrored (i.e., `c == r`), it results in only 1 additional rook being placed.
     - The final configurations depend on the remaining positions after all moves.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the \( k \) moves, counting the number of non-mirrored and mirrored moves.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of positions occupied by rooks after considering the effect of mirrored and non-mirrored moves.
   - The remaining positions `m` are calculated as \( n - num \).

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The base cases are defined for 1 and 2 remaining positions.
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \) is used to fill the DP table.
   - This relation accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and considering the effect on the previous configurations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the code handles these cases correctly by printing 1.
   - The DP approach ensures that all possible configurations are counted correctly for larger values of \( m \).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation \( \mod (10^9 + 7) \) is applied correctly to handle large numbers.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The code accurately calculates the number of possible final configurations based on the given rules and constraints.
