t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are valid, meaning they do not share the same row or column with any previously placed rook, and the implied computer moves are also valid.
