Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic used to update `num` is flawed. The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique positions (rows and columns) occupied by rooks after the initial `k` moves. However, the current implementation does not properly account for the fact that mirrored moves (where `r != c`) contribute to the count differently than non-mirrored moves.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1
1 2
```
The program calculates `num` as 2 because the move (1, 2) contributes 2 to `num` (one for the row and one for the column). However, this is incorrect. The correct value of `num` should be 1 because the move (1, 2) occupies only one unique position (either row 1 or column 2, but not both).

Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of configurations using dynamic programming (`dp`) is also incorrect. The base cases and transitions in the DP table do not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly count the number of unique positions occupied by rooks and then use this count to compute the number of possible configurations.
