Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed based on the logic inside the loop for each iteration.

Explanation: For each value of `t`, the code reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `c` and `r`. It calculates `num` based on these inputs. Then, it computes `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `1` or proceeds to calculate and print a value from a dynamic programming array `dp`. The final output consists of these printed values for each iteration of the loop.
