You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each move you made are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n. The k moves and the implied computer moves are valid, meaning no two rooks attack each other.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the input provided within the loop iterations. For each iteration, the program processes two inputs: `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `c` and `r`. It calculates `num` based on the conditions given and then determines `m` as `n - num`. Depending on the value of `m`, it either prints `1` or proceeds to compute a dynamic programming array `dp` to print the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
    #
    #The exact output values depend on the specific inputs provided for each iteration, but the general process is as follows:
    #- If `m` is 0 or 1, it prints `1`.
    #- Otherwise, it computes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to achieve a certain state with `i` remaining elements, and prints `dp[m]`.
    #
    #Since the initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) and the loop runs exactly `t` times, the output will be a sequence of lines, each corresponding to one of these iterations. Each line will contain either `1` or a computed value from the dynamic programming array `dp`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases where for each case, it receives integers t, n, k, and a list of k moves represented by coordinates (r_i, c_i). It validates the moves ensuring no two rooks attack each other and returns whether the moves are valid for all test cases.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
