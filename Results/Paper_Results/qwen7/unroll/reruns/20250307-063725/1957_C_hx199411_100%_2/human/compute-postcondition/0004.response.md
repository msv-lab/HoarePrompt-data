Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing a series of test cases where for each case, it receives integers t, n, k, and a list of k moves represented by coordinates (r_i, c_i). It validates the moves ensuring no two rooks attack each other and returns whether the moves are valid for all test cases.**
