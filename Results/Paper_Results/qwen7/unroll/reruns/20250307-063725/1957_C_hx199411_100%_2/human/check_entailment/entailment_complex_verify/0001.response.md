### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move involves placing a rook and the opponent mirroring the move.
   - The key points are:
     - Each move reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
     - If a move is mirrored (i.e., `c != r`), it results in 2 additional rooks being placed.
     - If a move is not mirrored (i.e., `c == r`), it results in only 1 additional rook being placed.
     - The final configurations depend on the remaining positions after all moves.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the \( k \) moves, counting the number of non-mirrored and mirrored moves.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of positions occupied by rooks after considering the effect of mirrored and non-mirrored moves.
   - The remaining positions `m` are calculated as \( n - num \).

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of configurations for the remaining positions.
   - The base cases are defined for 1 and 2 remaining positions.
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7) \) is used to fill the DP table.
   - This relation accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and considering the effect on the previous configurations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \), the code handles these cases correctly by printing 1.
   - The DP approach ensures that all possible configurations are counted correctly for larger values of \( m \).

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation \( \mod (10^9 + 7) \) is applied correctly to handle large numbers.

However, upon closer inspection of the dynamic programming part, there is a critical flaw in the recurrence relation. The recurrence relation should account for the fact that each new rook placement can be in any of the remaining positions, but the current implementation does not correctly reflect this.

The correct recurrence relation should be:
\[ dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-1]) \mod (10^9 + 7) \]
This relation correctly accounts for the fact that for each of the \( i-1 \) remaining positions, we can place a rook in any of them, leading to \( (i-1) * dp[i-1] \) new configurations.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly states that the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The dynamic programming part of the code uses an incorrect recurrence relation, leading to an incorrect count of configurations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
