Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads integers t, n, k, and k pairs of coordinates (r_i, c_i). It calculates the number of non-attacking rook positions based on the given moves and prints the result for each test case. If the remaining non-attacking positions are 0 or 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to achieve the remaining non-attacking positions and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).**
