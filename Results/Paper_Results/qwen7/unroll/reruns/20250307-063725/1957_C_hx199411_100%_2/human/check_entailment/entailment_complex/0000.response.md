Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of different final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where you and the computer place rooks alternately. The rooks cannot attack each other, meaning no two rooks can be in the same row or column.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `k`, and the coordinates of the rooks placed so far.
   - It calculates `num` which counts the number of diagonal moves (where \(r_i = c_i\)) and non-diagonal moves (where \(r_i \neq c_i\)).
   - It then calculates `m` as `n - num`, representing the number of remaining non-attacking positions.
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, it directly prints 1 because there's only one way to place the remaining rooks.
   - For larger `m`, it uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without violating the non-attacking condition, using a DP array `dp`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct because for 1 remaining position, there's only 1 way to place a rook, and for 2 remaining positions, there are 3 ways (either rook in the first or second position).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is also correct. This accounts for placing a rook in the current position and considering the previous positions' configurations.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles edge cases where `m` is 0 or 1 correctly.
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic for counting and handling the remaining positions is sound.
   - The dynamic programming approach is appropriate for calculating the number of valid configurations.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
