You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:

        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where for each case, it reads integers t, n, k, and k pairs of coordinates (r_i, c_i). It calculates the number of non-attacking rook positions based on the given moves and prints the result for each test case. If the remaining non-attacking positions are 0 or 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to achieve the remaining non-attacking positions and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic used to update `num` is flawed. The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique positions (rows and columns) occupied by rooks after the initial `k` moves. However, the current implementation does not properly account for the fact that mirrored moves (where `r != c`) contribute to the count differently than non-mirrored moves.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 1
1 2
```
The program calculates `num` as 2 because the move (1, 2) contributes 2 to `num` (one for the row and one for the column). However, this is incorrect. The correct value of `num` should be 1 because the move (1, 2) occupies only one unique position (either row 1 or column 2, but not both).

Additionally, the logic for calculating the number of configurations using dynamic programming (`dp`) is also incorrect. The base cases and transitions in the DP table do not accurately reflect the constraints of the problem.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly count the number of unique positions occupied by rooks and then use this count to compute the number of possible configurations.
