Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers (`array`) representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer (`find`) such that `1 <= find <= n`. It performs a binary search to find the position of `find` in the array. If `find` is found, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of `find` incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` itself incremented by 1. If `find` is not found, it prints `1` and returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index where `find` should be inserted to maintain the order, and the second string is `-1`.**
