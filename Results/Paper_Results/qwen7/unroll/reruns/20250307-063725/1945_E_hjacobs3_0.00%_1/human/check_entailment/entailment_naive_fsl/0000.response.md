Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array. According to the problem description, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation so that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The current implementation only checks if the middle element is equal to `x` and swaps if necessary, but it does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position.

Here is an example where the program fails:
- Input:
  ```
  6 3
  6 5 4 3 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  1 6
  3 4
  ```

- Actual Output:
  The program will not produce any output because it does not attempt to move the element `3` to the correct position.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position before performing the binary search. This can be done by finding the index of `x` and swapping it to the start of the array if necessary.
