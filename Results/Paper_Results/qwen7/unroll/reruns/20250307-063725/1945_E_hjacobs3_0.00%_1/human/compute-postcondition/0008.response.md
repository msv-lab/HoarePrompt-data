Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is the index of the last element in the array that is less than `find`, or `-1` if no such element exists.
- `l` is equal to `r + 1`.
- `l` is also equal to `array.index(find)`.

Given these conditions, let's break down the scenario:

1. If there is an element in the array that is less than `find`, `r` would be the index of the last such element, and `l` would be `r + 1`.
2. If there is no element in the array that is less than `find`, then `r` would be `-1`, and consequently, `l` would also be `-1` because `-1 + 1 = -1`.

In both cases, the value of `l` is determined independently of the value of `r` once `array.index(find)` is evaluated. The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
