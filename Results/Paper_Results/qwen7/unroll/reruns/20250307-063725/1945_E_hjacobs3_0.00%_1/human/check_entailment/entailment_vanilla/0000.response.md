Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position.
2. The provided program attempts to solve this by calling `func_1(array, find)` and printing the result. However, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.
3. Specifically, `func_1` performs a binary search but does not handle the necessary swaps to ensure that the target value `x` is at the `l`-th position after the search.
4. The function `func_1` only checks if the middle element is greater than or equal to `x` and adjusts the search range accordingly. It does not attempt to swap elements to achieve the desired outcome.
5. The function also prints `1` or `0` directly without performing any swaps, which means it does not actually modify the array as required.
6. The main program does not include the logic to perform the swaps and print them as specified in the problem statement.

Given these observations, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
