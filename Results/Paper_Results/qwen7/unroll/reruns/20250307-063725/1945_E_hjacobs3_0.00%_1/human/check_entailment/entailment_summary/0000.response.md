Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array with up to two swaps to ensure that the element `x` is at the position `l` after the binary search.
2. The function `func_1` performs a binary search but does not handle the case where the element `x` is not found in the array. Instead, it incorrectly returns the index where `x` should be inserted to maintain the order, which is not the same as finding the two swaps needed.
3. The program does not provide any mechanism to perform the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct position before performing the binary search.
4. The execution summary describes a different behavior than what the code actually implements, which further confirms the mismatch between the expected and actual implementation.

Correctness: **False**
