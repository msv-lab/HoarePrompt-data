### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The task is to rearrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the first element `p_l` is equal to `x`.
- The binary search should be applied to a sorted version of the permutation, but since the permutation is not sorted, we can perform at most 2 swaps to make it work.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` is supposed to perform a binary search on the array and return the indices of the swap if necessary.
- The function does not seem to handle the case where the element `x` is not present in the array, which is a critical issue as per the problem statement.

#### Program Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   while t > 0:
       (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
       array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
       res = func_1(array, x)
       if res:
           print(' '.join(res))
       t -= 1
   ```
   - This part reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(array, find):
       n = len(array)
       (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
       while l <= r:
           mid = (l + r) // 2
           if array[mid] >= find:
               r = mid - 1
           else:
               l = mid + 1
       if l != array.index(find):
           print(1)
           return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
       else:
           print(0)
   ```
   - The function performs a binary search to find the position of `find`.
   - If `find` is not found, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the swap needed to place `find` at the correct position.
   - If `find` is found, it prints `0` and returns `None`.

#### Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where `find` is not present in the array. According to the problem statement, the goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation so that after performing the binary search, `p_l` is equal to `x`. The current implementation only checks if the middle element is equal to `x` and swaps if necessary, but it does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position.
- The function summary indicates that if `find` is not found, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the swap needed to place `find` at the correct position. However, the actual implementation does not return these indices; it just prints `1`.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The function `func_1` does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position before performing the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
