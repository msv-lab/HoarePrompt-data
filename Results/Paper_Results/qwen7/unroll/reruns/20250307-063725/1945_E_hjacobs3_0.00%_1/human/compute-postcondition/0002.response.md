Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while l <= r:`. The variables involved here are `l` and `r`.

2. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.

3. **Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `l <= r`.

4. **Check the Current Values**:
   - Currently, `l` is 0.
   - Currently, `r` is `n - 1`.

5. **Determine if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` is always true for any positive integer `n`.

Since the current values of `l` and `r` already satisfy the condition `l <= r`, no adjustments are necessary.

**Conclusion**:
No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

**Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1**
