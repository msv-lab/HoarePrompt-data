### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position.
2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array but does not handle the necessary swaps to ensure that the target value `x` is at the `l`-th position after the search.
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is correct; it narrows down the search range until `l` is just past the last valid position where the target `x` could be.
   - The function checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `x` in the array. If they are not equal, it prints `1` and returns a list with the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - If `l` is equal to the index of `x`, it prints `0`, indicating no swaps are needed.
3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program calls `func_1` and prints the result. If `func_1` returns a list, it prints the list, which contains the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The main program does not perform the actual swaps itself; instead, it relies on `func_1` to determine the necessary swaps and print them.
4. **Annotations Validation**:
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies the need for a swap when `l` is not equal to the index of `x`.
   - The main program correctly prints the indices of the elements to be swapped if `func_1` returns a list.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to identify the necessary swaps and print them. The function `func_1` correctly determines if a swap is needed and prints the indices of the elements to be swapped. The main program then prints these indices as required.
