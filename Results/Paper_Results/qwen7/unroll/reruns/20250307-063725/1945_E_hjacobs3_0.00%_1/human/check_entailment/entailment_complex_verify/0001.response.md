### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x` at the `l`-th position.
   - The provided program attempts to solve this by calling `func_1(array, find)` and printing the result.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` performs a binary search but does not handle the necessary swaps to ensure that the target value `x` is at the `l`-th position after the search.
   - Specifically, the function only checks if the middle element is greater than or equal to `x` and adjusts the search range accordingly. It does not attempt to swap elements to achieve the desired outcome.
   - The function prints `1` or `0` directly without performing any swaps, which means it does not actually modify the array as required.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program calls `func_1(array, find)` and prints the result.
   - If `func_1` returns a list with two strings, the main program prints those strings, which are supposed to represent the indices of the swaps.
   - If `func_1` returns `0`, the main program prints `0`.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.
   - The function `func_1` does not perform any swaps, and the main program does not handle the swaps either.

5. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not perform the necessary swaps and only prints `1` or `0`.
   - The main program does not handle the swaps either, which means the overall program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

### Final:
**False**
