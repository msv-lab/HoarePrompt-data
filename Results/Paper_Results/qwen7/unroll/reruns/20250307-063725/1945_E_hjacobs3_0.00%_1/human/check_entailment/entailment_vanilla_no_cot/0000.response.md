Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, it does not ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps. The binary search is implemented incorrectly and does not guarantee that the element `x` will be moved to the correct position `l`. Additionally, the function `func_1` only performs a single swap if necessary, which may not be sufficient to place `x` at the correct position `l` in some cases. The program also does not handle the requirement to perform at most 2 swaps correctly.
