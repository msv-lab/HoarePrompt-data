Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `l` and `r`. `l` is assigned the value 0, and `r` is assigned the value `n - 1`. The list `array` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it.
