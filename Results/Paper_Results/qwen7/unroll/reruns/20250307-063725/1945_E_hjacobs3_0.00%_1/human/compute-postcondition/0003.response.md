Output State: **The variable `l` will be equal to `r` + 1, and `r` will be the index of the last element in the array that is less than `find`, or `r` will be -1 if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The loop is performing a binary search on the array to find the position where `find` would fit in the sorted order of the array. After the loop completes, `l` will be the first index where `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be the last index where `array[r]` is less than `find`. If `find` is not in the array, `l` will be `r` + 1, and `r` will be the highest index where the value is less than `find`, or it will be -1 if no such element exists.
