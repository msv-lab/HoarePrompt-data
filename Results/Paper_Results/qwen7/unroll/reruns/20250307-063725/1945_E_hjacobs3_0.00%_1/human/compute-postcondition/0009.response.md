Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and a parameter `find`, which is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the value of `l + 1` (where `l` is the index of `find` in the array) converted to a string, and the second string is the index of `find` in the array converted to a string and incremented by 1.**
