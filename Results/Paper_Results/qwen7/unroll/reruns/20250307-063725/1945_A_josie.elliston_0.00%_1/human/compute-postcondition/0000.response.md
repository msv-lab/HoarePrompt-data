Output State: **`extroverts` is reduced by the value of `universals`; `ret` is the return value of `func_1(extroverts, universals)`.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and assigns its return value to `ret`. The value of `extroverts` is reduced by the value of `universals`. The initial values of `introverts` remain unchanged, and the precondition that `0 <= introverts, extroverts, universals <= 10^9` still holds.
