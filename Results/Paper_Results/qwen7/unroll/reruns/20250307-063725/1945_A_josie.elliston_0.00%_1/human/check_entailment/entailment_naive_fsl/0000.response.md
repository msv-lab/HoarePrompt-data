Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where there are more extroverts than can be paired with universals. Specifically, in the second test case (`1 4 1`), the program incorrectly returns `-1` instead of attempting to pair the remaining extroverts with universals.

To illustrate this, let's consider the second test case:
- `a = 1` (introverts)
- `b = 4` (extroverts)
- `c = 1` (universals)

According to the problem description:
- 1 introvert needs 1 tent.
- 3 out of 4 extroverts can be paired with 3 universals, requiring 1 tent.
- 1 extrovert remains and cannot form a group of 3 with the remaining universals, making it impossible to accommodate everyone.

However, the program incorrectly handles this scenario by returning `-1`. The correct approach would be to see if the remaining extroverts can be paired with universals. Since there is 1 universal left, it is possible to place the remaining extrovert with the universal in a tent, thus requiring only 2 tents in total.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
