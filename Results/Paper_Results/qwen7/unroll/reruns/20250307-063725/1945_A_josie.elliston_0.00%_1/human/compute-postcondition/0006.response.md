Output State: **The program returns the ceiling value of (extroverts + universals) divided by 3, where extroverts is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts and universals is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. This value is calculated under the condition that if extroverts is not divisible by 3 and extroverts % 3 + universals is greater than or equal to 3, then the condition holds true. Otherwise, if extroverts is divisible by 3, no changes are made to extroverts and universals.**
