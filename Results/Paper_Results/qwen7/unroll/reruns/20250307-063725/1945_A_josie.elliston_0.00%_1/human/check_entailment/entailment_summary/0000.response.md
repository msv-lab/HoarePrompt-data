Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences. The key points are:
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function handles the allocation of tents for extroverts and universals.
   - It checks if the number of extroverts is divisible by 3. If not, it checks if the remainder plus the number of universals is at least 3. If so, it calculates the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   - If these conditions are not met, it returns `None`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles the overall calculation by calling `func_1` for extroverts and universals.
   - It adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to allocate tents as per the given constraints, and it returns `-1`.

4. **Execution Summaries**:
   - The execution summaries show that `func_1` correctly handles the allocation logic for extroverts and universals.
   - `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the number of introverts to it, returning `-1` when necessary.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The examples provided cover various scenarios, including impossible cases where the number of extroverts and universals cannot satisfy the requirements for extroverts to have a tent with two others.
   - The implementation correctly handles these edge cases by returning `-1` when appropriate.

Given the analysis and the execution summaries, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
