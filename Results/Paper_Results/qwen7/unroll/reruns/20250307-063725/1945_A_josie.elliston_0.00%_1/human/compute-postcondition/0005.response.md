Postcondition: `extroverts` is a non-negative integer representing the number of extroverts, and `universals` is a non-negative integer representing the number of universals. If `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and `extroverts % 3 + universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then the condition holds true. If `extroverts` is divisible by 3, no changes are made to `extroverts` and `universals`.
