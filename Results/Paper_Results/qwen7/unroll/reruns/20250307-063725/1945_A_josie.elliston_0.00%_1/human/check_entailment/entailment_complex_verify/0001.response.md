### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can be placed in any configuration.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for `b` extroverts and `c` universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.
   - If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, all extroverts can be paired perfectly with universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, we need to check if the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.

5. **Testing the Functions:**
   - For the test cases provided, the functions seem to handle the logic correctly.
   - The examples in the problem statement match the expected outputs.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the implementation:

- **Function `func_1`**: 
  - The condition `if (extroverts % 3 != 0) :` is correct, but the subsequent check `if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3) :` is flawed. This condition incorrectly assumes that `extroverts % 3 + universals` should be at least 3, which is not always true. For example, if `extroverts = 2` and `universals = 1`, `extroverts % 3 + universals = 2 + 1 = 3`, which should be valid, but the function would incorrectly return `None`.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function correctly handles the case where `func_1` returns `None` and returns `-1`.
  - However, the logic in `func_1` needs to be fixed to ensure it correctly calculates the number of tents needed.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the cases where `b % 3 != 0` and ensures that the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(extroverts, universals):
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if universals < 3 - (extroverts % 3):
            return None
    return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the edge cases.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected implementation of `func_1`, the overall logic of the program is now correct. The functions handle the edge cases properly and return the correct number of tents or `-1` when it is impossible to accommodate all participants.
