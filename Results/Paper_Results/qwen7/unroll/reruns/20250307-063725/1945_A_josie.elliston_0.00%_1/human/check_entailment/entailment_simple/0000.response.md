Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as inputs.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`. If this condition is met, it returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
   - If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, it simply returns `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as inputs.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and stores the result in `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns `introverts + ret`.

3. **Test Cases and Expected Outputs:**
   - For the given test cases, we need to verify if the program correctly calculates the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's impossible.
   - The logic in `func_1` and `func_2` seems to align with the problem statement:
     - Each extrovert needs a tent with at least two others, which is handled by `func_1`.
     - Introverts need individual tents, which are added directly to the result.
     - Universals can fit into any configuration, so they are also handled by `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The edge case where `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` should indeed return `-1` because it's impossible to form a group of 3 for those extroverts without violating their preferences.
   - The logic handles large values (`10^9`) appropriately since the division and ceiling operations are well-defined.

5. **Verification:**
   - Let's manually verify a few test cases:
     - Test Case 1: `1 2 3`
       - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `2` (since `2 % 3 + 3 = 5` which is >= 3).
       - `func_2(1, 2, 3)` returns `1 + 2 = 3`.
     - Test Case 2: `1 4 1`
       - `func_1(4, 1)` returns `2` (since `4 % 3 + 1 = 2` which is < 3).
       - `func_2(1, 4, 1)` returns `-1` because it's impossible to form groups of 3 for the remaining extroverts.
     - Other test cases follow similar logic.

Given the analysis and verification, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of tents required.

Correctness: **True**
