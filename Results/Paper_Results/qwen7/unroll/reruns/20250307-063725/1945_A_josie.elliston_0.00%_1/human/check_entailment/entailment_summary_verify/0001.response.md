### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate `a` introverts, `b` extroverts, and `c` universals.
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can be placed in any configuration.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for `b` extroverts and `c` universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, it checks if the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.
   - If not, it returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling of `(b + c) / 3`.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts and universals, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of introverts to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `b % 3 == 0`, all extroverts can be paired perfectly with universals.
   - If `b % 3 != 0`, we need to check if the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.

5. **Testing the Functions:**
   - For the test cases provided, the functions seem to handle the logic correctly.
   - The examples in the problem statement match the expected outputs.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a flaw in the implementation of `func_1` and how it handles the edge cases. Specifically, the function does not correctly account for the scenario where there are not enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents when `b % 3 != 0`.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1: `b % 3 == 0`**
  - If `b % 3 == 0`, then all extroverts can be paired perfectly with universals, and the function correctly returns `ceil((b + c) / 3)`.

- **Case 2: `b % 3 != 0`**
  - If `b % 3 != 0`, the function should check if the remaining universals can fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.
  - The current implementation incorrectly assumes that if `b % 3 + c < 3`, it is impossible to accommodate the extroverts. This is not always true. For example, if `b = 1` and `c = 1`, `b % 3 + c = 2`, which is less than 3, but it is still possible to accommodate the extrovert with one universal.

### Corrected Implementation:

To fix this, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the case where `b % 3 != 0` and there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the extroverts' tents.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(extroverts: int, universals: int) -> Optional[int]:
    if extroverts % 3 != 0:
        if universals >= extroverts % 3:
            return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
        else:
            return None
    else:
        return ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the edge cases and ensure that the number of tents is calculated accurately.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected implementation of `func_1`, the overall logic of the program is now correct. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate due to the flaw in the `func_1` implementation.

Final: **False**

Correctness: **False**
