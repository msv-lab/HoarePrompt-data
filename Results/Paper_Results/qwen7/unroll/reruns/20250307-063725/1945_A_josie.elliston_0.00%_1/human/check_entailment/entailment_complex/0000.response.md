### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` takes `extroverts` and `universals` as input.
   - It checks if `extroverts` is not divisible by 3.
     - If `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals >= 3`, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.
     - Otherwise, it returns `None`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` takes `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals` as input.
   - It calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and stores the result in `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

3. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences.
   - Each introvert needs a tent alone.
   - Each extrovert needs a tent with two others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity:**
   - The function correctly handles edge cases where `extroverts` cannot form complete groups of 3 with available universals.
   - For example, if `extroverts % 3 != 0` and `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3`, the function correctly returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - The function correctly sums the number of introverts and the calculated number of tents for extroverts and universals.

5. **Test Cases Verification:**
   - The annotated test cases cover various scenarios including edge cases and typical cases.
   - The results match the expected outputs as per the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences, or return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Correctness:
**True**
