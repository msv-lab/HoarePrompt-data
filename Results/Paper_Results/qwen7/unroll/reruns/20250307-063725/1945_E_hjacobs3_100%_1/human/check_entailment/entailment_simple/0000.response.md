Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps to make sure that the binary search finds the target value `x` at position `l`.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by performing a binary search and then checking if the target value `x` is already at the correct position `l`. If not, it prints the index of the element at `l` and the index of `x` as a swap.
3. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed. Specifically:
   - The binary search loop should initialize `l` to 1 and `r` to `n + 1` as per the problem statement.
   - The condition `if (l != array.index(find)):` checks if the target value `x` is not at the current `l`, but it should check if `array[l]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The function should also handle the case where the target value `x` is at the boundary positions `l` or `r`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure the target value `x` is found at the correct position after at most 2 swaps. Therefore, the annotated program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
