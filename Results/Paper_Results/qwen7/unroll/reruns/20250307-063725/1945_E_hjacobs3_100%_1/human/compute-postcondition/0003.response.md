Output State: **l and r are such that l == r - 1 and array[l] either equals or is greater than 'find', while array[r] is either less than 'find' or does not exist.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as the difference between `r` and `l` is greater than 1. Inside the loop, `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `l` and `r`. Depending on whether `array[mid]` is less than or equal to `find`, `l` or `r` is updated. After the loop exits, `l` will be one position less than `r`, and `array[l]` will be the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, or `l` will point to the position where `find` could be inserted to maintain the order.
