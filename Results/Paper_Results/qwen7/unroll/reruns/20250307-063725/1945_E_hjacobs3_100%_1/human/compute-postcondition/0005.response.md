Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` and `r` are such that `l` == `r` - 1.
- `array[l]` either equals or is greater than `'find'`.
- `array[r]` is either less than `'find'` or does not exist.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `'find'` in the array.

The `print(1)` statement will simply print the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
