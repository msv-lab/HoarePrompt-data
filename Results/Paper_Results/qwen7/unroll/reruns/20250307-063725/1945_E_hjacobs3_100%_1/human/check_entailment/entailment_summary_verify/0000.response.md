### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- We need to rearrange the permutation such that after the binary search, the element `x` is found at the position `l`.
- We can perform at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` performs a binary search on the array to find the position of `x`.
- If `x` is not found, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the current position of `x` and its correct position.
- If `x` is found, it prints `0` and returns the same indices.

#### Provided Program Code:
```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  2 4
  1 5
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

The function `func_1` performs the binary search and finds that `3` is not at position `l`. However, it only prints `1` and returns the indices without performing any swaps. This is incorrect because the element `3` should be swapped to its correct position.

To fix this, we need to add the necessary logic to perform the swaps. Here's how we can modify the function:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        # Find the correct position of x
        correct_pos = array.index(find)
        # Perform the swaps
        if l < correct_pos:
            array[l], array[correct_pos] = array[correct_pos], array[l]
            if l != array.index(find):
                array[l], array[array.index(find)] = array[array.index(find)], array[l]
        else:
            array[l], array[correct_pos] = array[correct_pos], array[l]
        print(2)
        return [str(l + 1), str(correct_pos + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly perform the necessary swaps to place `x` at the correct position.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the necessary modifications to the function, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality as it fails to perform the necessary swaps.

**Final: False**
