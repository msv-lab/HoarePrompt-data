Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, `l` is 0, `r` is n**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables `l` and `r`. Initially, `l` is set to 0 and `r` is set to `n`, where `n` is the length of the list `array`. The state of the `array` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it within the given code snippet.
