Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  5
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  2 4
  1 5
  ```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because the element `3` is not at position `l` after the binary search. The correct positions to swap are `2` and `4`, and then `1` and `5`. Therefore, the program fails to place the element `3` at the correct position using the specified operations.
