Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the binary search is not used to find the correct position to swap elements in order to make `p_l` equal to `x`. Instead, the program directly checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x` and prints the result without performing any swaps. This approach does not address the requirement to rearrange the permutation using at most two swaps before applying the binary search.

Here's the breakdown of the issues:
1. The binary search is not used to find the correct position to swap elements.
2. The function `func_1` does not perform any swaps and simply checks if the element at position `l` is equal to `x`.
3. If `array[l]` is not equal to `x`, it incorrectly prints `1` and returns the indices without actually performing the swap.
4. If `array[l]` is equal to `x`, it prints `0` and returns the same indices without performing any swaps.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem requirements and therefore is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
