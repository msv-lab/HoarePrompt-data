Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` and `r` are such that `l == r - 1`.
- `array[l]` either equals or is greater than `'find'`.
- `array[r]` is either less than `'find'` or does not exist.
- The index of `'find'` in `array` is equal to `l`.

The print statement is simply `print(0)`.

Since the print statement directly outputs the integer `0`, regardless of the conditions on `array[l]` and `array[r]`, the output will be:

Output: **0**
