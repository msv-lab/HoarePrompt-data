### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to rearrange the permutation `array` using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds `x` at position `l`.
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, but it assumes the array is sorted.
   - The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by finding the index of `x` and checking if it matches `l`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the value `x` to find.
   - It reads the permutation `array` and calls `func_1(array, x)` to determine the necessary swaps.
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if the index of `x` is already `l`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct and works as intended.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies when a swap is needed and prints the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.
   - The function ensures that only one swap is made if `x` is not already at the correct position, which aligns with the problem statement that at most 2 operations are allowed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `x` is already at the correct position (`l`), the function correctly prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the correct position, the function correctly prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements: the number of operations followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the function `func_1`. The function assumes that the binary search will always find the correct position `l` where `array[l]` should be `x`. This is not necessarily true because the binary search only guarantees that `array[l]` is either `x` or greater than `x` when `array[mid] <= x`, and less than `x` when `array[mid] > x`. It does not guarantee that `array[l]` is exactly `x`.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the binary search is performed correctly and that the element at `l` is indeed `x` after the search. If `array[l]` is not `x`, then we need to check if swapping `array[l]` with another element can make `array[l]` equal to `x`.

Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Check if the element at l is x
    if array[l] == find:
        return []
    
    # Find the index of x in the array
    find_index = array.index(find)
    
    # Swap the elements at positions l and find_index
    array[l], array[find_index] = array[find_index], array[l]
    
    return [str(l + 1), str(find_index + 1)]
```

With this corrected function, the program should work as expected. The original assessment was partially correct but missed the crucial point that the binary search alone might not place `x` at the correct position `l`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
