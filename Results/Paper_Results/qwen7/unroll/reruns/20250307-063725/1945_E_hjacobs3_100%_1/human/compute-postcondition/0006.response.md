Output State: **The program returns ['l + 1', 'find' index in array + 1]**

Explanation: Given the initial conditions, `l` is one less than `r`, and `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, while `array[r]` is less than `find` or does not exist. The code returns a list containing two strings: the first is `l + 1` (as a string), and the second is the index of `find` in the array plus one (also as a string). Since `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array, both parts of the returned list are calculated based on the given conditions.
