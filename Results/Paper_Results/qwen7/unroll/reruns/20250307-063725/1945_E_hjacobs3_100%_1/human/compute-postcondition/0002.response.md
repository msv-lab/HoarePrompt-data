Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while r - l > 1`. The variables involved here are `r` and `l`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `r - l > 1`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`.
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - Given `l = 0` and `r = n`, the expression `r - l` evaluates to `n - 0 = n`.

5. **Determine the adjustment needed**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `r - l` must be greater than 1.
   - Currently, `r - l = n`, and for `n - 0 > 1` to be true, `n` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n and n must be greater than 1**
