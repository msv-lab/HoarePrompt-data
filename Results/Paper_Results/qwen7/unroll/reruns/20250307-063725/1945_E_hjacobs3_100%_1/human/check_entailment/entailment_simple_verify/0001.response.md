### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds `x` at position `l`.
   - The binary search algorithm assumes the array is sorted, but the given permutation is not necessarily sorted.
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the correct position for `x` and perform the necessary swaps.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the value `x` to find.
   - It reads the permutation `array` and calls `func_1(array, x)` to determine the necessary swaps.
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if the index of `x` is already `l`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct and works as intended.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies when a swap is needed and prints the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.
   - However, the function `func_1` only performs one swap if `x` is not already at the correct position. This is a critical flaw because the problem statement guarantees that at most 2 operations are sufficient, but the function does not account for the possibility that two swaps might be necessary.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `x` is already at the correct position (`l`), the function correctly prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the correct position, the function correctly prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped. However, this does not guarantee that the permutation can be rearranged in at most 2 swaps.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements: the number of operations followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. While it correctly identifies when a swap is needed, it fails to handle cases where two swaps are required. The function `func_1` only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient to rearrange the permutation in all cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
