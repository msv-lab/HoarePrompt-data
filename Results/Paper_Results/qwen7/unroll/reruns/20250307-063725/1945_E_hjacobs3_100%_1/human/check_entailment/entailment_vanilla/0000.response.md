### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to rearrange the permutation `array` using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds `x` at position `l`.
   - The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly, but it assumes the array is sorted.
   - The function `func_1` attempts to solve the problem by finding the index of `x` and checking if it matches `l`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n` and the value `x` to find.
   - It reads the permutation `array` and calls `func_1(array, x)` to determine the necessary swaps.
   - The function `func_1` performs the binary search and checks if the index of `x` is already `l`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements that need to be swapped.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The binary search logic is correct and works as intended.
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies when a swap is needed and prints the indices of the elements to be swapped.
   - The function ensures that only one swap is made if `x` is not already at the correct position, which aligns with the problem statement that at most 2 operations are allowed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `x` is already at the correct position (`l`), the function correctly prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the correct position, the function correctly prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements: the number of operations followed by the indices of the elements to be swapped.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It handles all cases where the permutation needs to be rearranged using at most 2 swaps to ensure the binary search finds `x` at the correct position.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
