The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of size `n`, and `find`, which is an integer such that `1 <= find <= n`. The function returns the index (position) of `find` in the list `array` plus one.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` of integers representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 <= find <= n`. It returns the index of `find` in `array` plus one.**
