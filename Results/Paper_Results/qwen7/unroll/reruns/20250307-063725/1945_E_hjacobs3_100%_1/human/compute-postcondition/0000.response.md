Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and `n` is the length of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(array)` calculates the length of the list `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `array` as a permutation of size `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the original state of `array`.
