Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program is designed to handle arrays `a` and `b`, but the problem statement specifies only one array `a` and a series of queries. There is no mention of a second array `b`.

2. **Query Processing**: The program processes the entire array `a` and another array `b` up to a certain index `k`, but it does not process the queries as specified in the problem. It does not iterate over the ranges `[l, r]` for each query.

3. **Conditions for Output**: The program uses a boolean expression to determine whether to print 'Y' or 'N', but it does not correctly check for the existence of at least one pair of different elements within the queried range `[l, r]`.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints 'YNEOS' based on some conditions, which does not match the required output format of printing two indices `i` and `j` if they exist, or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these discrepancies, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
