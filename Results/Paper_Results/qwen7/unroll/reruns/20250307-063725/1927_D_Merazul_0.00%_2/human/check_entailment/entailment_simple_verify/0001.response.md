### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given subarray such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \(-1 -1\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` is defined but does not match the problem requirements.
   - The function uses `R` as a lambda function to read input, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it incorrectly processes the data for each test case.
   - It reads three lists of integers and uses sets (`a` and `b`) to store them.
   - It then iterates over a range from 1 to `k` (which is half of the length of the array), checking membership in sets `a` and `b`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the requirement to find distinct elements in the specified subarray.
   - The final print statement uses a string slicing technique to output either "YES" or "NO" or "-1 -1", which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r` and find any two distinct elements.
   - We can use a set to keep track of unique elements in the current subarray and then check for distinct elements.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code shows that the function reads the necessary inputs but does not correctly process the queries.
   - The variables `a` and `b` are sets containing elements from the first and second halves of the array, respectively.
   - The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `k`, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly identify distinct elements in the specified subarray.
   - The final print statement uses a string slicing technique to output either "YES" or "NO" or "-1 -1", which is not relevant to the problem.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not handle the queries as required and does not find distinct elements in the specified subarrays.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
