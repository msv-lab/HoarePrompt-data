Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. The function `func()` is designed to read input but does not process the queries according to the problem statement.
2. The variables `a` and `b` are defined as sets from the input, but the logic to check for pairs of different elements within a query range `[l, r]` is missing.
3. The logic for determining if there are different elements in the range `[l, r]` is flawed and does not correctly implement the required functionality.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Read the number of test cases, the array, and the queries.
- For each query, check the subarray from index `l` to `r` and find any two indices `i` and `j` where `a[i] != a[j]`.
- Output the indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    from collections import defaultdict

    def find_different_elements(l, r):
        seen = set()
        for i in range(l - 1, r):
            if a[i] not in seen:
                seen.add(a[i])
            else:
                return i, i + 1
        return -1, -1

    R = lambda: map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n, = R()
        a = list(R())
        q, = R()
        results = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = R()
            i, j = find_different_elements(l, r)
            results.append((i, j))
        for i, j in results:
            print(i, j)
        if t > 0:
            print()  # Print an empty line between test cases

func()
```

This corrected version reads the input, processes each query to find a pair of different elements, and prints the results accordingly.
