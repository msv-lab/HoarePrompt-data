### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given subarray such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \(-1 -1\).
   - The provided code does not match this requirement at all. Instead, it reads three lists of integers and uses sets to store them, which is irrelevant to the problem.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` is incorrectly structured and does not address the problem requirements.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it incorrectly processes the data for each test case.
   - It reads three lists of integers and uses sets (`a` and `b`) to store them, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The function iterates over a range from 1 to `k` (which is half of the length of the array), checking membership in sets `a` and `b`, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - The final print statement uses a string slicing technique to output either "YES" or "NO" or "-1 -1", which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r` and find any two distinct elements.
   - We can use a set to keep track of unique elements in the current subarray and then check for distinct elements.
   - The provided code does not implement this logic at all.

4. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary describes a completely different functionality, where it checks pairs of elements from two arrays `a` and `b` and prints "Y" or "N" based on certain conditions. This is not relevant to the problem at hand.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not handle the queries as required and does not find distinct elements in the specified subarrays.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
