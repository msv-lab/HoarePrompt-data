Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is in the range 1 to 10^6, q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n; R is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user and splits it into a tuple of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This does not change the values of the existing variables but introduces a new function `R` that can be used later in the program to read input in a specific format.
