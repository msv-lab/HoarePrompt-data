### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given subarray such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \(-1 -1\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` is defined but does not match the problem requirements.
   - The function uses `R` as a lambda function to read input, which is correct.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`, but then it incorrectly processes the data for each test case.
   - It reads three lists of integers and uses sets (`a` and `b`) to store them.
   - It then iterates over a range from 1 to `k` (which is half of the length of the array), checking membership in sets `a` and `b`.
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly implement the requirement to find distinct elements in the specified subarray.
   - The final print statement uses a string slicing technique to output either "YES" or "NO" or "-1 -1", which is not relevant to the problem.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r` and find any two distinct elements.
   - We can use a set to keep track of unique elements in the current subarray and then check for distinct elements.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code indicates that the function processes multiple test cases, reads the necessary inputs, and uses sets to store elements.
   - However, the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the subarray queries.
   - The variables `m` and `n` are used to count elements in `a` and `b` respectively, but they do not correctly reflect the presence of distinct elements in the subarray.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not handle the queries as required and does not find distinct elements in the specified subarrays.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment correctly identifies that the given code does not solve the problem as intended. The function does not process the subarray queries correctly and does not find distinct elements in the specified subarrays.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.
