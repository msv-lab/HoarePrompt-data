Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the round). It constructs a tree representation using these inputs. After determining the two leaves of the tree, it calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Based on whether these distances are odd or even, it returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.**
