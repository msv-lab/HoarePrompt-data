Output State: **queue is a deque containing the tuple (start, 0), start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, target is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, tree is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes, visited is a set containing the element start.**

Explanation: The code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the starting node `start` to it. The other variables (`queue`, `start`, `target`, and `tree`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
