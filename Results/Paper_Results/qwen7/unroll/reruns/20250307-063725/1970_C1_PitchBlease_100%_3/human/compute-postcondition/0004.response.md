Output State: The output state will be the shortest distance from the starting node `start` to the target node `target` in the tree, or None if there is no path from `start` to `target`.

Explanation: The loop iteratively explores the tree starting from the `start` node, using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. It keeps track of the distance (`dist`) from the starting node to each node it visits. When it reaches the `target` node, it returns the distance. If the loop finishes without finding the `target` node, it means there is no path from `start` to `target`, and thus the function would return `None`.
