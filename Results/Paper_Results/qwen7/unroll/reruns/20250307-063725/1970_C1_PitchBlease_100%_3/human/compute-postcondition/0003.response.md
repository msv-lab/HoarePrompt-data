Output State: The queue is empty, containing no elements; the visited set includes all nodes that can be reached from the start node, marked as visited during the traversal; the dist variable holds the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, or None if the target node is not reachable.

This means that after the loop completes, the `queue` will be empty because all possible nodes to process have been dequeued. The `visited` set will contain every node that was explored or reached from the `start` node, marking them as visited. The `dist` variable will either hold the shortest path distance from the `start` node to the `target` node, or it will be `None` if the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node.
