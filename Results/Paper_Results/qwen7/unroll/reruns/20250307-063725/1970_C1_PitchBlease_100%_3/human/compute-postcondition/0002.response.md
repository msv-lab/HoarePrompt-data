The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the `queue` is not empty (`queue`).

Right before the loop, the `queue` contains the tuple `(start, 0)`. For the loop to execute the first time, the `queue` must contain at least one element.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed since the `queue` already contains the tuple `(start, 0)` and is not empty.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (start, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
