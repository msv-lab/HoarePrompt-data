The function `bfs` accepts two parameters: `start`, which is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, and `target`, which is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree. Additionally, the function uses a dictionary named `tree` representing the adjacency list of the tree, where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes. If the function cannot find a path from the `start` node to the `target` node using breadth-first search, it returns -1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a starting node and a target node, and uses a breadth-first search to find a path from the start to the target in a given tree. If no path exists, it returns -1.**
