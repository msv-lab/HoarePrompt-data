The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and `start` is an integer representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5. The function returns either the string 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), edges (a list of tuples), and start (an integer). It returns 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the given conditions.**
