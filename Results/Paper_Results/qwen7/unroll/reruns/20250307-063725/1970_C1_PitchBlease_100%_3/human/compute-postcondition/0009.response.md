Postcondition: **`leaves` is a list containing all nodes that have exactly one adjacent node, `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, `n` remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, `start` is an integer representing the starting node for the round, `dist1` is the distance from the starting node to the first leaf node using BFS, `dist2` is the distance from the starting node to the second leaf node using BFS, and both `dist1` and `dist2` are even numbers**
