#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node for the round. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves, and 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, forming a complete representation of the tree based on the given edges. The list for each node contains all nodes it is connected to through the edges provided in the `edges` list. `n` remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, and `start` is an integer representing the starting node for the round, which remains unchanged from its initial value.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the round). It constructs a tree representation using these inputs. After determining the two leaves of the tree, it calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Based on whether these distances are odd or even, it returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, target is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and tree is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes.
def bfs(start, target):
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])
    visited = set([start])
    while queue:
        current, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == target:
            return dist
        
        for neighbor in tree[current]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be the shortest distance from the starting node `start` to the target node `target` in the tree, or None if there is no path from `start` to `target`.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iteratively explores the tree starting from the `start` node, using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. It keeps track of the distance (`dist`) from the starting node to each node it visits. When it reaches the `target` node, it returns the distance. If the loop finishes without finding the `target` node, it means there is no path from `start` to `target`, and thus the function would return `None`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a starting node and a target node in a tree represented by an adjacency list. It performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node. If a path exists, it returns the length of the shortest path; otherwise, it returns -1.
