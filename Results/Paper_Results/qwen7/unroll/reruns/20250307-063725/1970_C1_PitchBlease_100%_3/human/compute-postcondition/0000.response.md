Output State: **queue is a deque containing the tuple (start, 0), start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, target is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and tree is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring nodes.**

Explanation: The code initializes a queue using a deque data structure and adds a tuple `(start, 0)` to it. The `start` variable remains unchanged, and the `target` and `tree` variables retain their initial states.
