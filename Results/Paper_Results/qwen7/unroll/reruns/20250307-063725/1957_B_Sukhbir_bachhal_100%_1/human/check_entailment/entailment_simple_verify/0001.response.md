### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing an array of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it constructs the array `arr` as follows:
     - Calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and subtracts 1 from it. This gives the largest possible value with the most 1s in its binary form.
     - Appends this value to `arr`.
     - Subtracts this value from `k` and appends the result to `arr`.
     - Fills the rest of the array with zeros.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds the highest bit position set in `k` using a loop.
   - It returns the position minus one, which corresponds to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing `k`.
   - However, the construction logic for `n > 1` may not always produce the optimal solution. Specifically, the approach of splitting `k` into two parts and filling the rest with zeros might not maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n=1` and `k=5`, the output is `5`, which is correct.
   - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output is `1 2`, which sums to `3` and has the maximum number of 1s in the OR result.
   - For `n=2` and `k=5`, the output is `5 0`, which sums to `5` but does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the OR result. The optimal solution would be `1 4` which also sums to `5` and has more 1s in the OR result (`1 | 4 = 5`).
   - For `n=6` and `k=51`, the output is `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which sums to `51` but does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the OR result. The optimal solution would be `3 1 1 16 8 12` which also sums to `51` and has more 1s in the OR result (`3 | 1 | 1 | 16 | 8 | 12 = 25`).

6. **Conclusion**:
   - While the program correctly handles the edge case when `n == 1`, the construction logic for `n > 1` does not guarantee the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.
