### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case**: When `n > 1`, the program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. For `n > 1`, it uses the function `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and constructs the sequence accordingly.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This is done by repeatedly dividing `n` by 2 until it becomes zero and counting the number of divisions. The final result is `position - 1`.
   - If `k` is 0, the function returns -1, which is correct because no positive power of 2 can be formed from 0.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program constructs the sequence as follows:
     - Adds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` (i.e., `2 ** counter - 1`).
     - Adds the remaining value (`k - arr[-1]`) to ensure the sum is `k`.
     - Fills the rest of the sequence with zeros.
   - This construction ensures that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s possible.

5. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`, which is correct since the sum must be `k` and the sequence consists of a single element.

6. **Output**: The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case, ensuring the conditions are met.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to construct a sequence that satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
