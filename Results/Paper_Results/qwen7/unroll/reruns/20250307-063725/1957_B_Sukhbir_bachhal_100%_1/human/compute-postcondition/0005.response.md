Output State: **position is 16 and n is 0.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is not equal to 0. In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by one bit (`n >>= 1`), which effectively divides `n` by 2, and `position` is incremented by 1. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. If we start with `n` being a 16-bit number (which is the maximum value for `n` before it becomes 0 after 16 shifts), then after 16 iterations, `n` will be 0 and `position` will be 16.
