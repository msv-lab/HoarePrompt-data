Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the position of the highest bit set in `k`. However, it doesn't use this information effectively to construct the sequence.

2. **Sequence Construction Logic**: The logic inside the loop where the sequence is constructed is flawed. Specifically:
   - If `n > 1`, it tries to add `2 ** counter - 1` and `k - arr[-1]` to the array. This approach does not guarantee that the bitwise OR will have the maximum number of 1s.
   - Adding zeros in between does not help in maximizing the number of 1s in the bitwise OR.

3. **Example Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `2 5`, the expected output should be `1 4` because `1 | 4 = 5` (binary `1 | 100 = 101`), which has 2 ones. However, the current implementation outputs `5 0`, which does not achieve the maximum number of 1s.

To solve this correctly, you need to ensure that the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s. One effective strategy is to distribute the value of `k` across the sequence in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the OR result. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    for i in range(n):
        arr.append(k & (-k))
        k -= k & (-k)
    print(*arr)
```

This solution works as follows:
- It iteratively finds the largest power of 2 that fits into `k` and subtracts it from `k`.
- This ensures that each element in the sequence contributes to the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
