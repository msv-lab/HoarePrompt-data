### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires constructing an array of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the bitwise OR of these integers has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it constructs the array `arr` as follows:
     - Calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and subtracts 1 from it. This gives the largest possible value with the most 1s in its binary form.
     - Appends this value to `arr`.
     - Subtracts this value from `k` and appends the result to `arr`.
     - Fills the rest of the array with zeros.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function finds the highest bit position set in `n` using a loop.
   - It returns the position minus one, which corresponds to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when `n == 1` by printing `k`.
   - The construction logic ensures that the sum of elements in `arr` equals `k`.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the bitwise OR of the constructed array has the maximum number of 1s. The current logic only guarantees that the sum condition is met but not necessarily the bitwise OR condition.

5. **Example Verification**:
   - For `n=1` and `k=5`, the output is `5`, which is correct.
   - For `n=2` and `k=3`, the output is `1 2`, which sums to `3` and has the maximum number of 1s in the OR result.
   - For `n=2` and `k=5`, the output is `5 0`, which sums to `5` but does not maximize the number of 1s in the OR result. The optimal solution would be `3 2`, which also sums to `5` and has more 1s in the OR result.
   - For `n=6` and `k=51`, the output is `3 1 1 32 2 12`, which sums to `51` but does not necessarily maximize the number of 1s in the OR result. A better solution could be `3 1 1 32 1 1`, which also sums to `51` and has more 1s in the OR result.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to satisfy the sum condition but fails to ensure the maximum number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.
