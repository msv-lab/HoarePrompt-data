### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Integer Case**: For the case when `n == 1`, the program correctly prints `k` since it needs to satisfy the sum condition with just one element.

3. **Multiple Integers Case**: For the case when `n > 1`, the program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. It does this by:
   - Setting the first element to `2^counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit.
   - Setting the second element to `k - arr[-1]` to ensure the sum is `k`.
   - Filling the rest of the array with zeros.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` minus 1. This value (`2^counter - 1`) will have the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation for a given `k`.
   - The function works correctly by repeatedly shifting `n` right until it becomes zero, counting the number of shifts needed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is a power of 2, `func_1` correctly identifies the highest bit position.
   - If `k` is 0, `func_1` returns -1, which is handled by the main loop to set the first element to 0.

6. **Output**: The program prints the constructed sequence for each test case, ensuring the sum is `k` and the bitwise OR condition is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
The program logic and the function `func_1` are correctly implemented to meet the problem requirements. There are no logical errors or edge cases that the program fails to handle.

### Correctness:
**True**
