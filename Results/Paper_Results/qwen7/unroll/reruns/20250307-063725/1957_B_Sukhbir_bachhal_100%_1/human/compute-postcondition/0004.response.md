The only variable in the loop head is `n`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

Right before the loop, `n` is an integer. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero.

State: **`position` is 0 and `n` must be non-zero**
