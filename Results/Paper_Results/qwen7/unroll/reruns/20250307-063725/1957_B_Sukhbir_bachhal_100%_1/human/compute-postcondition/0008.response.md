Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` within the range of 1 to 10^4. It checks if `n` is zero; if so, it returns -1. Otherwise, it repeatedly divides `n` by 2 until `n` becomes zero, counting the number of divisions. Finally, it returns the count minus one, which will be 15 in this case.**
