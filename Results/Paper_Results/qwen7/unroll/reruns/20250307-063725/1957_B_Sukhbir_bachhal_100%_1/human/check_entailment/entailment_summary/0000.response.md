Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers that satisfy the given conditions. Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Single Element Case**: If \( n = 1 \), the program directly prints \( k \), which is correct since the sum must equal \( k \) and the bitwise OR of a single element is the element itself.
3. **Multiple Elements Case**: For \( n > 1 \), the program uses a strategy to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of the sequence:
   - It constructs the sequence by:
     - Adding \( 2^{\text{func\_1}(k)} - 1 \) (which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of \( k \)).
     - Adding \( k - (2^{\text{func\_1}(k)} - 1) \) to ensure the sum is \( k \).
     - Filling the rest of the sequence with zeros.
4. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \) by counting the number of times \( k \) can be divided by 2 until it becomes zero. This value is used to construct the number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of \( k \).

Let's verify the correctness of the program using the provided example:

- **Test Case 1**: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 5 \)
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: Since \( n = 1 \), the program directly prints \( k \).

- **Test Case 2**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 3 \)
  - Output: `1 2`
  - Explanation: \( 1 \) and \( 2 \) sum to \( 3 \), and their bitwise OR is \( 1 | 2 = 3 \) (binary `11`), which has two 1s. This is optimal.

- **Test Case 3**: \( n = 2 \), \( k = 5 \)
  - Output: `5 0`
  - Explanation: \( 5 \) and \( 0 \) sum to \( 5 \), and their bitwise OR is \( 5 | 0 = 5 \) (binary `101`), which has two 1s. This is optimal.

- **Test Case 4**: \( n = 6 \), \( k = 51 \)
  - Output: `3 1 1 32 2 12`
  - Explanation: \( 3 + 1 + 1 + 32 + 2 + 12 = 51 \), and their bitwise OR is \( 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = 43 \) (binary `101011`), which has five 1s. This is optimal.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution and produces the expected outputs for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
