Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is a positive integer obtained from the first input split by spaces.
3. **Determine the requirement for the loop to execute**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

Given that `t` is a positive integer, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is non-zero.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained from the first input split by spaces and `t` must be non-zero**
