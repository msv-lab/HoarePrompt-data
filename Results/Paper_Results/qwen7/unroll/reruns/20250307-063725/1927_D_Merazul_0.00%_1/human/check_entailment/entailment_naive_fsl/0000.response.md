Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to set operations and does not address the task of finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges.

The program reads input and performs operations on sets `a` and `b`, but it does not process the query ranges or find pairs of different elements within those ranges as required. Instead, it checks for the presence of elements in sets and prints a boolean value or a specific string based on certain conditions, which is unrelated to the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output would be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program will not produce this output because it does not handle the query ranges and find pairs of different elements as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
