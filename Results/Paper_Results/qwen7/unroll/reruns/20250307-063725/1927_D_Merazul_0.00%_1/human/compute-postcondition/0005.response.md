Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (a positive integer), n (an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive), a (a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive), and q (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive). Each query is represented by two integers l and r (where 1 <= l < r <= n). The function processes q queries, each defined by l and r, and returns the result based on the specified conditions.**

Case_1: For each query (l, r), the function returns the sum of elements in the subarray a[l:r].
Case_2: If any of the constraints are violated (e.g., t is not positive, n is out of range, elements in a are out of range, q is out of range, or l and r do not satisfy 1 <= l < r <= n), the function returns an appropriate error message.
