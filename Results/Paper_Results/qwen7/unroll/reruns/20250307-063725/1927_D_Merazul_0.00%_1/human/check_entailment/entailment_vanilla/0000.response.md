### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of different elements within a specified subarray for each query. If no such pair exists, it should return `-1 -1`.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the input but does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem.
   - The variables `a` and `b` are defined as sets from the input, but the logic to check for different elements within the specified subarray is missing.
   - The loop iterates over a range from 1 to `k + 1`, where `k` is not defined in the context of the problem. It also uses bitwise operations (`&`, `|`, `~`) in a way that does not align with the problem requirements.
   - The condition `f &= u | v` and the subsequent operations do not correctly identify pairs of different elements.
   - The final print statement uses `'YNEOS'` which is not relevant to the problem's output format.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r` and find any two indices `i` and `j` such that `a[i] != a[j]`.
   - We can use a set to store unique elements in the current subarray and check if there are at least two different elements.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It uses unnecessary bitwise operations and does not handle the subarray queries as required.
