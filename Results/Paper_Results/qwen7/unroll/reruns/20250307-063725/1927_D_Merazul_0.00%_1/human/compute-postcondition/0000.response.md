Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes input from the user, splits it into multiple integers, and returns them as a tuple. This does not change the values of the existing variables but introduces a new function `R` that can be used to read input in subsequent lines of code.
