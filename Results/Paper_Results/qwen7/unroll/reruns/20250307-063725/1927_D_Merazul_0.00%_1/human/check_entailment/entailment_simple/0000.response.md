### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a specified subarray such that \(a_i \ne a_j\). If no such pair exists, the output should be \(-1 -1\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses a lambda function `R` to read multiple integers from input.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the size of the array, and the elements of the array into sets `a` and `b`.
   - It then iterates over a range from 1 to `k` (which seems to be incorrectly defined in the code).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is in sets `a` and `b` and updates flags `m` and `n` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints a string `'YNEOS'` based on certain conditions.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The variable `k` is never defined correctly in the code. It seems to be intended to represent the number of queries, but it is not used properly.
   - The logic inside the loop is not correctly implemented to solve the problem. The sets `a` and `b` are not being used to find pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(a_i \ne a_j\).
   - The final print statement `'YNEOS'` does not match the required output format, which should be pairs of indices or \(-1 -1\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not find pairs of indices as required and does not handle the input and output as specified.

### Correctness:
**False**
