Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program incorrectly reads the input. Specifically, it reads `k` but then uses `k // 2` in calculations without any clear purpose. The program should read `n` (the length of the array) and `q` (the number of queries), followed by the array itself and then the queries.

2. **Set Operations Misuse**: The program creates sets `a` and `b` from parts of the input but does not use them appropriately to solve the problem. The sets are not used to check for distinct elements within the queried ranges.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly determine if there are distinct elements within the queried range. The variables `m` and `n` are calculated based on membership in `a` and `b`, but these sets do not represent the queried range.

4. **Output Format**: The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions checked, but it should print pairs of indices or `-1 -1` for each query.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the problem's requirements and thus is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
