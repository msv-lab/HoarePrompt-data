Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The code reads `t`, the number of test cases, but it incorrectly processes the input for each test case. Specifically, it reads `*_, k` from the input, which is not aligned with the problem requirements. The correct approach would be to read `n` (the size of the array), the array itself, `q` (the number of queries), and then the queries themselves.

2. **Set Operations**: The code attempts to use sets (`a` and `b`) to check membership and perform operations like union and intersection. However, the logic for calculating `m` and `n` and determining `f` is flawed. The variables `a` and `b` should represent the elements in the subarray from index `l` to `r` for each query, not fixed sets derived from the entire array.

3. **Query Processing**: The code does not process individual queries as specified. Instead, it seems to be trying to determine if there are any differing elements in the entire array, which is not what the problem requires.

4. **Output Format**: Even if the logic were correct, the output format would still be incorrect. The code prints 'YNEOS' (which stands for 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes', 'No', 'Yes') based on some conditions, but the problem requires printing specific indices `i` and `j` for each query where `a[i] != a[j]`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
