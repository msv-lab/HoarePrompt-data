Output State: **`t` is a positive integer obtained from the first input split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array `a` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= `l` < `r` <= n.**

The code `t, = R()` assigns the first value from the input split by spaces to `t`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `q`, and the queries) remain unchanged from their initial state.
