The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer. Therefore, `t` must be adjusted to be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
