Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing an integer result from the loop's execution. For each test case, if `n` (the length of the list `a`) is 1, the output will be `1`. Otherwise, the output will be the count of elements in the sorted list `a` that are equal to the middle element (or one of the two middle elements if `n` is even).

This means that for each test case, the program will read an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sort the list, and then check how many times the middle element(s) appear in the list, printing this count.
