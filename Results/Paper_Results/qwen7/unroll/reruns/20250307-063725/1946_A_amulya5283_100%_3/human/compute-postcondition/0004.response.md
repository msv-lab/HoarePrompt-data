Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers (where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]). It returns a result for each test case based on the given list `a`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes the length of an array and the array itself. The function processes each test case individually and returns results accordingly.
