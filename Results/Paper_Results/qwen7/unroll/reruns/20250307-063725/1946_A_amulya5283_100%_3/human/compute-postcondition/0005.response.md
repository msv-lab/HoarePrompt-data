Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it sorts the list `a`, determines the middle element(s) of the sorted list, and counts how many times this element(s) appears in the list. If the list has only one element, it prints `1`. Otherwise, it prints the count of occurrences of the middle element(s). The function reads these inputs from standard input and outputs the results for each test case to standard output.**
