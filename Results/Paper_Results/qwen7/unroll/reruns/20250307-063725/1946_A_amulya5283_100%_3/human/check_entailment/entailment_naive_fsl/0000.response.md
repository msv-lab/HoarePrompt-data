Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the median is increased to the next unique value. Instead, it counts the number of elements equal to the current median, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
4
7 3 3 1
```

The correct output should be `2` because we can increment the first `3` to `4` and the second `3` to `4`, making the array `[7, 4, 4, 1]`. The median of this array is `4`, which is greater than the original median `3`.

However, the program will output `2` because it counts the number of `3`s, which is `2`. This is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the median is increased to the next unique value.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
