Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The code incorrectly calculates the median index using `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. This formula is incorrect because the median index should be `n // 2` when `n` is odd, and `(n // 2) - 1` when `n` is even. The current implementation does not handle both cases correctly.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Operations**: The code counts the number of elements from the median position to the end of the array that are equal to the median value. This count is not relevant to finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median. Instead, it should compare the median value with the next possible value that could be achieved by incrementing the smallest element.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            mdn = n // 2
            median = a[mdn]
            res = 0
            
            # Find the minimum number of operations needed to make the median larger
            for i in range(mdn):
                if a[i] < median:
                    diff = median - a[i]
                    res += diff
                    a[i] += diff
            
            # Check if the new median is greater than the old median
            if a[mdn] <= median:
                res += 1
            
            print(res)
```

This corrected function properly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array.
