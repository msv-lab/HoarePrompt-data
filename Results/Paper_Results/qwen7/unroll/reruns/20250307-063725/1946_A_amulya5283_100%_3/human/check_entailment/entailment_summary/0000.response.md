Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array.
2. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations to increase the median.
3. The program instead counts the number of occurrences of the middle element(s) in the sorted array, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement.
4. Specifically, the program:
   - Sorts the array.
   - Determines the middle index (`mdx`).
   - Counts how many elements are equal to the element at the middle index.
5. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations to increase the median. For example, if the middle element is already the maximum possible value, no operations would be needed, but the program would still count the occurrences of that element.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
