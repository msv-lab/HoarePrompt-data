Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing an integer result from the loop's execution. For each test case, the output will be the count of elements equal to the middle element (or one of the middle elements if the length of the list is even) in the sorted list `a`, excluding those elements up to and including the true middle index.

To break it down further:
- For each test case, the program sorts the list `a`.
- If the length of the list `n` is 1, it prints 1.
- Otherwise, it calculates the middle index `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
- It then iterates from `mdx` to the end of the list, counting how many times the middle element appears.
- Finally, it prints this count for each test case.
