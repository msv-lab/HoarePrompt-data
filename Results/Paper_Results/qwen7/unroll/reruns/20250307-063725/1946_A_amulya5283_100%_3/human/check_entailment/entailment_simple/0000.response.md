Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. The array `a` is sorted, which is necessary to find the median.
4. If `n` is 1, the program prints 1, which is correct since the only element is its own median.
5. For `n` greater than 1, the program calculates the median index `mdx` correctly as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`.
6. The program then iterates through the array starting from `mdx` to the end, counting how many elements are equal to the median value.
7. However, the logic to determine the minimum number of operations to increase the median is flawed. The program simply counts the number of elements equal to the median, but it should instead calculate the difference between the current median and the next smallest or largest unique value that can be reached with the minimum number of operations.

Given the above points, the provided program does not solve the problem correctly because it does not account for the actual minimum number of operations needed to increase the median.

Correctness: **False**
