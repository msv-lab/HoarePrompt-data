Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. In `func_1`, the logic for handling the attacks is implemented correctly. The function alternates between attacking the first and last ship, reducing their durability by 1 each time.
3. The function correctly handles the case where a ship's durability reaches 0, removing it from further attacks.
4. The function correctly breaks the loop when there are no more attacks (`k == 0`) or when the remaining ships cannot be attacked due to their durability.
5. The function correctly counts the number of ships that sink during the process.
6. The function returns the correct count of sunk ships after processing all attacks.
7. The state of the variables after the loop (with `l` set to `n` and `r` set to `-1`) is consistent with the expected behavior of the program.

Given the above analysis, the provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided.

Correctness: **True**
