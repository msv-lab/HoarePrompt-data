Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`.
2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\).
   - `k` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\).
   - `a` is a list of positive integers where each integer \(a_i\) is not exceeding \(10^9\).
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is \(n - 1\).
   - `sunks` is 0.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Currently, `l` is 0 and `r` is \(n - 1\).
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, `r` will always be at least 0 (because \(n - 1 \geq 0\)).
   - Therefore, the condition `l <= r` will always be true given the current values of `l` and `r`.

Since the loop condition `l <= r` is already satisfied with the current values of `l` and `r`, no adjustments are needed for these variables.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - No states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\), `k` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), `a` is a list of positive integers where each integer \(a_i\) is not exceeding \(10^9\), `l` is 0, `r` is \(n - 1\), `sunks` is 0**
