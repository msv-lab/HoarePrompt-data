Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), and `a` is a list of positive integers each not exceeding \(10^9\). It processes the list `a` by comparing elements at indices `l` and `r`, reducing their values based on the value of `k`, and increments a counter `sunks` each time a reduction operation is successfully completed. After the loop terminates, the function returns the total count of successful reduction operations stored in `sunks`. At the end of the function, the indices `l` and `r` are set to `n` and `-1`, respectively.**
