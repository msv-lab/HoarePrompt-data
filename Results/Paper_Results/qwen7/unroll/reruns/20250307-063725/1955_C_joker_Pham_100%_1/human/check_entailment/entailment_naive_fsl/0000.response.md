Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the durability of both the first and last ships is reduced to zero in a single step. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 5
  1 2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly stops after the second attack because it does not properly handle the scenario where both the first and last ships sink simultaneously. The program should continue attacking until all ships have sunk or there are no more attacks left.
