You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding \(10^{15}\), and `a` is a list of positive integers each not exceeding \(10^9\). It processes the list `a` by comparing elements at indices `l` and `r`, reducing their values based on the value of `k`, and increments a counter `sunks` each time a reduction operation is successfully completed. After the loop terminates, the function returns the total count of successful reduction operations stored in `sunks`. At the end of the function, the indices `l` and `r` are set to `n` and `-1`, respectively.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also correctly reads the durabilities of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1(n, k, a)` with the appropriate arguments, which is correct.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - The logic inside the loop is designed to handle the alternating attacks on the first and last ships until one of them sinks.
   - The function correctly handles the case where both the left and right ships have the same durability and the case where the durability of the left or right ship is less than the other.
   - The function breaks the loop when there are no more attacks (`k == 0`) or when the durability of the current ship being attacked is reduced to zero.
   - The function counts the number of ships that sink during the process.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the number of attacks `k` is less than the durability of the first or last ship, ensuring that the loop breaks appropriately.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the first and last ships is equal, reducing the durability of the ship being attacked and updating the pointers accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the first or last ship is reduced to zero, breaking the loop and incrementing the count of sunk ships.

5. **Output**: The function returns the number of ships that have sunk, which is printed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
