Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers each not exceeding 10^9. After executing the loop and updating the variable `sunks`, the function returns the total number of times the condition `sunks += 1` was executed.**
