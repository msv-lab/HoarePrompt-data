### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`. It also correctly reads the durabilities of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1(n, k, a)` with the appropriate arguments, which is correct.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the attacks.
   - The logic inside the loop is designed to handle the alternating attacks on the first and last ships until one of them sinks.
   - The function correctly handles the case where both the left and right ships have the same durability and the case where the durability of the left or right ship is less than the other.
   - The function breaks the loop when there are no more attacks (`k == 0`) or when the durability of the current ship being attacked is reduced to zero.
   - The function counts the number of ships that sink during the process.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the number of attacks `k` is less than the durability of the first or last ship, ensuring that the loop breaks appropriately.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the first and last ships is equal, reducing the durability of the ship being attacked and updating the pointers accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the first or last ship is reduced to zero, breaking the loop and incrementing the count of sunk ships.

5. **Output**: The function returns the number of ships that have sunk, which is printed correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
