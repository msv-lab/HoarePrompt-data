Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of ships (`n`), the number of attacks (`k`), and the durability of the ships (`a`).

2. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the appropriate arguments, which is correct.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It iterates through the process of attacking the ships according to the problem statement.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly handles the reduction of durability and the sinking of ships when their durability reaches 0.
   - The function correctly breaks the loop when there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).
   - The function correctly counts the number of sunk ships and returns this count.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `l` and `r` are at the same position, the function correctly handles the case where the remaining durability can sink the ship.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the ship is reduced to 0 and the ship is removed from further consideration.

5. **Output**: The function returns the correct number of sunk ships, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken.

Correctness: **True**
