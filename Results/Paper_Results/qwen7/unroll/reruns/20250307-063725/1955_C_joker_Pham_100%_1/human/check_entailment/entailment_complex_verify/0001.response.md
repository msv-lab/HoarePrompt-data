### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` correctly.
   - It reads the durabilities of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the correct arguments, which is correct.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - The loop simulates the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
   - The logic inside the loop is designed to handle the alternating attacks on the first and last ships until one of them sinks.
   - The function correctly handles the case where both the left and right ships have the same durability and the case where the durability of the left or right ship is less than the other.
   - The function breaks the loop when there are no more attacks (`k == 0`) or when the durability of the current ship being attacked is reduced to zero.
   - The function counts the number of ships that sink during the process.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the number of attacks `k` is less than the durability of the first or last ship, ensuring that the loop breaks appropriately.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the first and last ships is equal, reducing the durability of the ship being attacked and updating the pointers accordingly.
   - The function correctly handles the scenario where the durability of the first or last ship is reduced to zero, breaking the loop and incrementing the count of sunk ships.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the number of ships that have sunk, which is printed correctly.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the function. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks as described in the problem statement. The problem statement describes that the Kraken attacks the first ship, then the last ship, then the first again, and so on. However, the current implementation does not alternate between attacking the first and last ships correctly. Instead, it repeatedly attacks the first ship until it is sunk, then the last ship, and so on, without properly alternating.

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem description to illustrate the issue:

- **Example Input**:
  - `n = 4`, `k = 5`, `a = [1, 2, 4, 3]`
  
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - First attack: `a[0]` (first ship) is attacked, `a[0]` becomes 0, `a = [0, 2, 4, 3]`.
  - Second attack: `a[3]` (last ship) is attacked, `a[3]` becomes 1, `a = [0, 2, 4, 1]`.
  - Third attack: `a[0]` (first ship) is attacked, `a[0]` becomes 0, `a = [0, 2, 4, 1]`.
  - Fourth attack: `a[3]` (last ship) is attacked, `a[3]` becomes 0, `a = [0, 2, 4, 0]`.
  - Fifth attack: `a[0]` (first ship) is attacked, `a[0]` becomes 0, `a = [0, 2, 4, 0]`.

- **Actual Behavior**:
  - The current implementation would repeatedly attack the first ship until it is sunk, then the last ship, and so on, without properly alternating.

This discrepancy indicates that the function does not correctly simulate the alternating attacks as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program correctly implements the logic for simulating the alternating attacks. The actual implementation does not alternate between attacking the first and last ships correctly, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
