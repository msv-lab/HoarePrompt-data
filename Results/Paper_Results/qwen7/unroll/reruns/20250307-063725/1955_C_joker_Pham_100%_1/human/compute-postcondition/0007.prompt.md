You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and a is a list of positive integers where each integer a_i is not exceeding 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1

            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2

                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 == k:
                sunks += 1

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers where each integer `a_i` is not exceeding 10^9, `l` is n, `r` is -1, `sunks` is an integer representing the total number of times the condition `sunks += 1` was executed during the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, the value of `l` will be set to `n` because `l` is incremented until it exceeds `r`, which is initially `n-1`. Similarly, `r` will be set to `-1` because `r` is decremented until it is less than `l`, which is eventually set to `n`. The variable `sunks` will hold the total count of successful operations where either `a[l]` or `a[r]` is completely consumed (reduced to 0) and `sunks` is incremented.
    return sunks
    #The program returns the total number of times the condition `sunks += 1` was executed during the loop, where `l` is set to `n` and `r` is set to `-1` after the loop finishes executing.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers each not exceeding 10^9. After executing the loop and updating the variable `sunks`, the function returns the total number of times the condition `sunks += 1` was executed.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of times the condition `sunks += 1` was executed during the loop, where `l` is set to `n` and `r` is set to `-1` after the loop finishes executing.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
