### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can kill all monsters before they reach the player's position (point 0).
   - We have `k` bullets per second that can be used to reduce the health of monsters.
   - Monsters move towards the player after their health is reduced.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to simulate the process of firing bullets and checking if the player can survive.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player.
   - It then iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters.
   - If a monster's health is reduced to zero, it is considered dead and removed from further consideration.
   - The function returns `False` if a monster reaches the player's position (point 0).

3. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - Sorting the monsters by distance ensures that we always deal with the closest monsters first.
   - The loop continues until all monsters are either dead or have moved past the player.
   - The function correctly checks if any monster reaches the player's position.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints "YES" if the player can survive, otherwise "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when the number of bullets (`k`) is sufficient to kill all monsters before they reach the player.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the player can always choose the optimal sequence of shots to maximize survival.

6. **Testing:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the functions.
   - The code logic matches the problem requirements and constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player's position. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
