Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: The problem states that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\), and `t` is set to an input integer.

3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is set to an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
