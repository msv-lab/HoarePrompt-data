Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the problem statement:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Handling Bullets and Monsters:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to sort indices based on the absolute distance from the origin but does not correctly handle the logic for firing bullets and reducing monster health.
   - The logic inside the `while` loop where it tries to fire bullets and reduce monster health is flawed. It does not ensure that all monsters are killed before any of them reach the player.

2. **Incorrect Distance Increment:**
   - The variable `distance` is incremented after checking if the monster at the current index has been killed, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect behavior.

3. **Sorting Indices:**
   - Sorting indices based on the absolute distance from the origin is not sufficient to ensure that the player can kill all monsters before they reach the player. The player needs to strategically fire bullets to ensure that the most threatening monsters (those closest to the player) are dealt with first.

4. **No Strategy for Firing Bullets:**
   - The function does not implement a strategy to ensure that the player can always fire enough bullets to kill the monsters before they reach the player. It simply tries to reduce the health of monsters without considering the timing and positioning.

To solve this problem correctly, a more strategic approach is needed, such as using a priority queue to manage the order in which monsters should be targeted based on their proximity and health.
