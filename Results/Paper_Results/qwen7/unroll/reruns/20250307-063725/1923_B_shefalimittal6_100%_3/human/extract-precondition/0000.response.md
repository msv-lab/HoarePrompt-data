Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9. a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. x is a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.**
