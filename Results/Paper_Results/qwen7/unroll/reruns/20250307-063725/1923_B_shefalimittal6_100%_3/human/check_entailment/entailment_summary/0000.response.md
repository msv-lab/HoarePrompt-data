Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether it is possible to kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's starting position (point 0).
- The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` handles the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player, then iteratively fires bullets to reduce their health. If at any point a monster's position matches the current distance, the function returns `False`, indicating that the player cannot survive.
- The logic in `func_1` ensures that the player can always target the closest monsters first, which is crucial for survival since monsters move closer to the player each second.
- Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive.
- `func_2` correctly processes the input for each test case and uses `func_1` to determine the outcome for each case, printing 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

Since both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
