### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - This function is designed to simulate the process of firing bullets to reduce the health of monsters and checking if the player can survive.
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their distances from the player (character).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters until their health reaches zero.
   - If at any point a monster's position matches the current distance, the function returns `False`, indicating the player cannot survive.
   - If all monsters are successfully killed before any reach the player, the function returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, followed by the lists `a` and `x`.
   - It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if the player can survive.
   - Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints 'YES' or 'NO'.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The program correctly processes each test case and checks if the player can survive using the logic implemented in `func_1`.
   - The implementation accurately reflects the problem statement and constraints.
   - The function `func_1` correctly handles the sorting and iterative reduction of monster health based on the number of bullets available per second.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
