### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters before any of them reach the player's position (point 0).
   - The player can fire up to `k` bullets per second to reduce the health of monsters.
   - Monsters move towards the player after their health is reduced.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player.
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters.
   - If a monster's health is reduced to zero, it is considered dead and removed from further consideration.
   - The function returns `False` if a monster reaches the player's position (point 0).

3. **Key Points in `func_1`:**
   - Sorting the monsters by distance ensures that we always deal with the closest monsters first.
   - The loop continues until all monsters are either dead or have moved past the player.
   - The function correctly checks if any monster reaches the player's position.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It prints "YES" if the player can survive, otherwise "NO".

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when the number of bullets (`k`) is sufficient to kill all monsters before they reach the player.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the player can always choose the optimal sequence of shots to maximize survival.

6. **Testing:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the functions.
   - The code logic matches the problem requirements and constraints.

7. **Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the logic flow within `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly simulates the process of firing bullets and checking if any monster reaches the player's position.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the appropriate output.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player's position.
   - The program handles all constraints and edge cases appropriately.
   - The provided examples and the overall logic match the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
