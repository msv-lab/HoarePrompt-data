Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the movement of monsters and the firing of bullets according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the scenario where multiple monsters can move towards the player simultaneously within the same time step. Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate this issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 1 1
-1 1 2
```

According to the problem description:
- In the first second, you can fire 2 bullets. If you fire both bullets at the first monster, its health will decrease by 2, making it die.
- After the first second, the second monster (at position 1) and the third monster (at position 2) will move closer to the player (to positions 0 and 1, respectively).
- Since the second monster is now at position 0, the player loses.

However, the provided `func_1` function does not account for the simultaneous movement of monsters and the proper handling of the bullets. It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player and then attempts to kill them one by one, but it does not ensure that all monsters are handled correctly within the same time step.

To fix this, the function needs to consider the maximum distance a monster can move in a single second and ensure that all monsters are handled accordingly. The current implementation does not fully capture the dynamics of the game as described in the problem statement.
