Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads values for \( n \), \( k \), a list of integers \( a \), and another list of integers \( x \). It then calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to evaluate certain conditions and prints 'YES' if the condition is met, otherwise 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but outputs the results for each case.**
