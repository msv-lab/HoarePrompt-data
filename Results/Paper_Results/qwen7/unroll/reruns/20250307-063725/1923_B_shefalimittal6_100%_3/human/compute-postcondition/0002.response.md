Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^4, and now t is set to the final value after all iterations of the loop have completed. The value of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `x` are determined by user input within each iteration of the loop and do not affect the final value of `t`. The output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on the evaluation of `func_1(a, x, k)`.
