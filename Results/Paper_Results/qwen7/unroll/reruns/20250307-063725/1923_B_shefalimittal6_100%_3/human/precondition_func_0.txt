a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of the monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second. The length of a and x is n, and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5; 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9.
