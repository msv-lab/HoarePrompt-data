Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers representing the health of monsters (`a`), a list of integers representing the initial positions of the monsters (`x`), and a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second (`k`). It returns `True` if it's possible to fire enough bullets to reduce the health of all monsters to zero, given the constraints. If at any point the absolute position of a monster equals the current distance, the function returns `False`.**
