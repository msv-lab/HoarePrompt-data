Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; R is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user and splits it into integers. This function does not assign any values to existing variables or change their states. It also does not create new variables. Therefore, the only change is the definition of the lambda function `R`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and any other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.
