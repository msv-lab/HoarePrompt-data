Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles**:
   - The logic for calculating the number of triangles is flawed. The code attempts to calculate the number of triangles based on the distances between the chosen vertices, but it does not correctly account for the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.

2. **Sorting and Processing**:
   - The sorting and processing of the differences between consecutive chosen vertices (`val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))`) do not align with the problem's requirements. This sorting is unnecessary and does not help in finding the maximum number of triangles.

3. **Break Condition**:
   - The `break` statement inside the loop (`for i in val:`) is incorrect. It prematurely exits the loop when `y` is less than half of `i`, which does not necessarily lead to the maximum number of triangles.

4. **Consistency with Problem Constraints**:
   - The final calculation of `cons` and its assignment to the number of triangles is not consistent with the problem's constraints and requirements.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Vertices**: 
   - The total number of vertices available for forming triangles is `x + y`.

2. **Form Triangles**:
   - For a polygon with `k` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `k - 2`.

3. **Ensure Validity**:
   - Ensure that the number of triangles does not exceed the total number of vertices minus 2.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        # Calculate the total number of vertices available for forming triangles
        total_vertices = x + y
        
        # The maximum number of non-intersecting triangles is total_vertices - 2
        max_triangles = total_vertices - 2
        
        # Ensure the result does not exceed the maximum possible value
        print(min(max_triangles, n - 2))

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed and ensures the result does not exceed the total number of vertices minus 2.
