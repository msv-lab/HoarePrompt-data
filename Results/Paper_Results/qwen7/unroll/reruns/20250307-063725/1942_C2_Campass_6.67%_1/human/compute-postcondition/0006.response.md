Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints a value (`cons`) for each test case based on the given inputs. The value `cons` is derived through a series of operations including sorting, calculating differences, and applying conditional updates. The final output for each test case is the computed value of `cons`, which is constrained to be at most `n - 2`.**
