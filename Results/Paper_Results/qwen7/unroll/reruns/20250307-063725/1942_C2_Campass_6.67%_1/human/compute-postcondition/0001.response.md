Output State: **`t` is the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()`.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` assigns the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()` to the variable `t`. Since `R()` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers, `t` will be set to the first integer from the input. The initial condition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid, but now we know specifically which integer from the input is assigned to `t`.
