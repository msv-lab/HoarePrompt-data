### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of `x` chosen vertices.
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices and appends `n + l[0]` to handle circular indexing.

2. **Calculating Non-Adjacent Pairs:**
   - The code calculates the number of non-adjacent pairs (`sx`) by iterating through the sorted list of chosen vertices.
   - This is done by subtracting 1 from the difference between consecutive vertices and checking if the result is 1 (indicating an adjacent pair).
   - This step is correct because it counts the gaps between chosen vertices that are not directly connected.

3. **Sorting and Processing Remaining Vertices:**
   - The remaining segments between chosen vertices are stored in `val` and sorted.
   - The code then processes these segments to maximize the number of triangles. For each segment, it calculates how many triangles can be formed and updates `sx` accordingly.
   - The sorting criterion `(1 - x & 1, x)` ensures that smaller segments are prioritized when forming triangles, which is correct.

4. **Handling Remaining Vertices:**
   - If there are still remaining vertices (`y > 0`), the code tries to form more triangles using the largest segments first.
   - It ensures that the total number of triangles does not exceed the constraints.
   - The logic for updating `sx` and decrementing `y` is correct.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final number of triangles is calculated as `cons = x + sx - 2`, ensuring it does not exceed `n - 2`.
   - This formula is correct because each triangle requires 3 vertices, and we start with `x` chosen vertices plus any additional vertices used to form triangles.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum number of triangles for each test case.
   - The output is correctly formatted and matches the expected format.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating non-adjacent pairs and forming triangles seems correct.
- The sorting and processing of segments ensure that the maximum number of triangles is achieved.
- The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately.
- The final calculation and output are correct.
