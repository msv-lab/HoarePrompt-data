Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. It sorts the chosen vertices and appends a duplicate of the first vertex to handle circular nature of the polygon.
3. It calculates the differences between consecutive vertices and counts how many segments have a length of 1 (indicating a vertex that cannot contribute to forming a triangle).
4. It then sorts these differences and iterates through them to maximize the number of triangles that can be formed.
5. The logic for updating `sx` (which represents the total number of segments that can contribute to forming triangles) is correct.
6. Finally, it calculates `cons` as the minimum of `x + sx - 2` and `n - 2`, ensuring that the result is within the valid range.

Given the steps and the logic described, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
