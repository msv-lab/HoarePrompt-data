You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be the value printed by the loop after all iterations are completed.
    #
    #To understand this output state, let's break down the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization**: `t` is set to the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()`. This initializes the loop condition.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution**:
    #   - `t` is decremented by 1 in each iteration.
    #   - New values `n`, `x`, and `y` are assigned from `R()`.
    #   - A variable `sx` is initialized to 0.
    #   - A list `l` is populated with elements from `R()`, sorted, and modified by appending `n + l[0]`.
    #   - A list `val` is created where each element represents the difference between consecutive elements in `l` minus 1.
    #   - `val` is sorted based on specific criteria.
    #   - For each element in `val`, a calculation is performed to update `sx` based on conditions involving `y`.
    #   - `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2` and clamped to be at most `n - 2`.
    #
    #3. **Final Output**: The value of `cons` is printed after the loop completes.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `R()` and the initial state of `t` are not specified, the final output state will depend on these values. However, the general process described above will determine the value of `cons` which is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints a value (`cons`) for each test case based on the given inputs. The value `cons` is derived through a series of operations including sorting, calculating differences, and applying conditional updates. The final output for each test case is the computed value of `cons`, which is constrained to be at most `n - 2`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` and the list of `x` chosen vertices.
   - It sorts the list of chosen vertices and appends `n + l[0]` to handle circular indexing.

2. **Calculating Non-Adjacent Pairs:**
   - The code calculates the number of non-adjacent pairs (`sx`) by iterating through the sorted list of chosen vertices.
   - This is done by subtracting 1 from the difference between consecutive vertices and checking if the result is 1 (indicating an adjacent pair).

3. **Sorting and Processing Remaining Vertices:**
   - The remaining segments between chosen vertices are stored in `val` and sorted.
   - The code then processes these segments to maximize the number of triangles. For each segment, it calculates how many triangles can be formed and updates `sx` accordingly.

4. **Handling Remaining Vertices:**
   - If there are still remaining vertices (`y > 0`), the code tries to form more triangles using the largest segments first.
   - It ensures that the total number of triangles does not exceed the constraints.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final number of triangles is calculated as `cons = x + sx - 2`, ensuring it does not exceed `n - 2`.

6. **Output:**
   - The function prints the maximum number of triangles for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating non-adjacent pairs and forming triangles seems correct.
- The sorting and processing of segments ensure that the maximum number of triangles is achieved.
- The constraints and edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution appears to be correct based on the problem statement and examples.
