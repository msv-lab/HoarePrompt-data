Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The issue lies in the way the `start_year` is being updated. Specifically, the line `start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is incorrect for this problem. This line is trying to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the current `start_year` and `nums[x]`, but it does not correctly handle the sequential waiting period requirement.

To solve this problem correctly, you should start with the first sign occurring at year 0 (or any arbitrary year, since we are only interested in the difference between occurrences). For each subsequent sign, you need to find the next year where all previous signs have occurred, which is essentially finding the LCM of all the periods up to that point.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        current_year = 0
        for num in nums:
            current_year = lcm(current_year, num)
        print(current_year)

func()
```

This version uses the `lcm` function to correctly compute the least common multiple of the periods, ensuring that the tribe waits for the correct sequence of events to occur.
