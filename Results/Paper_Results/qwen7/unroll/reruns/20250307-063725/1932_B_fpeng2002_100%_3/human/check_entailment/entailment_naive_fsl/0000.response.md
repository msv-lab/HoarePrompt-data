Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. According to the problem description, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one. However, the current implementation calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities, which is not the correct approach.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

The correct sequence of years would be:
- First sign occurs in year 3.
- Second sign occurs in year 4 (after year 3).
- Third sign occurs in year 8 (after year 4).
- Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (after year 8).
- Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (after year 10).
- Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (after year 18).

However, the program incorrectly calculates the LCM of 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 18, which is 180, and prints 180 as the result. This is not the correct year because the signs do not occur sequentially as described.

To fix this, the program needs to iterate through the list of periodicities and update the `start_year` based on the current year and the next periodicity. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in nums:
            start_year = (start_year + x - 1) // x * x
        print(start_year)
```

This corrected version ensures that the `start_year` is updated correctly for each periodicity, maintaining the sequential occurrence of the signs.
