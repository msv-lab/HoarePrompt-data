Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function processes these inputs but does not specify any particular output in the given information.**

This means the function `func` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer `n` for each test case indicating the number of integers in the list, and a list of `n` integers. However, without further details on what operations are performed or what the expected return value is, the exact functionality cannot be fully described beyond accepting these specific types of inputs.
