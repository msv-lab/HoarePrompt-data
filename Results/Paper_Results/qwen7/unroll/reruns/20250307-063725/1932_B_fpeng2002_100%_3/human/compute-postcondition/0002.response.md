Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the value of `start_year` after processing each test case.

Explanation: For each test case (`num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, updating `start_year` based on the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. After processing all numbers in the list for a test case, it prints the final value of `start_year`. This process repeats for each test case specified by `num_tests`. Thus, the output consists of one integer per test case, showing the final value of `start_year` for each.
