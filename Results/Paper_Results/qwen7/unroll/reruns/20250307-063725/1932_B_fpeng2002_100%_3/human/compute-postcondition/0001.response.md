Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: The current state is that `num_tests` is an input integer, and the preconditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n` remain valid.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop requires `num_tests > 0` to execute, and given that `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
