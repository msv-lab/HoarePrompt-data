Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
- It initializes `start_year` to 0 and then iterates through the list of periodicities, updating `start_year` using the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`.
- Finally, it prints the updated `start_year` for each test case.

This approach correctly calculates the year when the nth sign will occur by ensuring that the year is a multiple of the last sign's periodicity after accounting for the previous signs' occurrences.

Correctness: **True**
