Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then updates a variable `start_year` based on a specific formula and prints the final value of `start_year` after processing all the numbers in the list. This process repeats for each test case, and the output consists of one integer per line, representing the final `start_year` value for each test case.**
