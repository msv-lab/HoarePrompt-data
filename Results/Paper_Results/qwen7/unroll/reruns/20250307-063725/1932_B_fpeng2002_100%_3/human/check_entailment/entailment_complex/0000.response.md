Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`).
- The logic to calculate the year when the nth sign will occur is correct. The formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` ensures that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
- The loop iterates over the list of periodicities and updates `start_year` accordingly, ensuring that the next sign's occurrence year is correctly calculated based on the previous sign's occurrence year.
- The final `start_year` value is printed for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
