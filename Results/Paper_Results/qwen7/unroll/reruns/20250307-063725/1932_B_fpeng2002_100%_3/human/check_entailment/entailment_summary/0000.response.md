Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic used to update `start_year` is flawed. The current implementation uses `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, which is not appropriate for finding the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one has occurred.

To find the next occurrence of the sign, we need to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities seen so far. This ensures that the tribe waits until all previously observed signs have occurred before starting to wait for the next one.

Here's how the program should be corrected:

1. Initialize `start_year` to 1 (or any other arbitrary year, since we're only interested in the relative timing).
2. For each periodicity in the list, update `start_year` to the LCM of `start_year` and the current periodicity.
3. Print the final value of `start_year`.

Given this analysis, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
