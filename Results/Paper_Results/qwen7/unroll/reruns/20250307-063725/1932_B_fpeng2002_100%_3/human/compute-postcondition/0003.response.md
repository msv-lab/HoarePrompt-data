Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case specified by the input integer `num_tests`, the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, updating `start_year` based on the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. After processing all the numbers in the list, it prints the final value of `start_year`. This process repeats for each test case, and the output consists of one integer per line, representing the final `start_year` value for each test case.
