You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case specified by the input integer `num_tests`, the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, updating `start_year` based on the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. After processing all the numbers in the list, it prints the final value of `start_year`. This process repeats for each test case, and the output consists of one integer per line, representing the final `start_year` value for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function processes these inputs but does not specify any particular output in the given information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
