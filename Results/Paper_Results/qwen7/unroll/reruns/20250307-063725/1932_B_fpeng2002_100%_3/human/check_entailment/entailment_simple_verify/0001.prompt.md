You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = (start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each corresponding to the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case specified by the input integer `num_tests`, the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then iterates through the list, updating `start_year` based on the formula `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. After processing all the numbers in the list, it prints the final value of `start_year`. This process repeats for each test case, and the output consists of one integer per line, representing the final `start_year` value for each test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is used to keep track of the current year in which the last sign occurred.
3. **Loop Through Signs**: For each test case, it iterates through the list of periodicities (`nums`).
4. **Update Start Year**: The logic for updating `start_year` is intended to find the next multiple of the current periodicity that is greater than or equal to the current `start_year`. However, the implementation of this logic is flawed.

   - The expression `(start_year // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is supposed to find the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
   - However, this approach does not correctly handle the cumulative effect of the periodicities. Instead, it resets `start_year` to the next multiple of the current periodicity without considering the cumulative effect of previous periodicities.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (6 signs with periodicities 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18):
     - The first sign occurs in year 3.
     - The second sign occurs in year 4 (next multiple of 2 after 3).
     - The third sign occurs in year 8 (next multiple of 4 after 4).
     - The fourth sign occurs in year 10 (next multiple of 5 after 8).
     - The fifth sign occurs in year 18 (next multiple of 9 after 10).
     - The sixth sign occurs in year 36 (next multiple of 18 after 18).

   - The program's logic fails to correctly compute the cumulative effect of the periodicities and instead resets `start_year` at each step, leading to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the cumulative effect of the periodicities. The logic for updating `start_year` needs to be revised to ensure it accounts for the cumulative effect of the periodicities.

### Correctness:
**False**
