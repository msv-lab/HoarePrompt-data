Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and the preconditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n` remain valid.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, these conditions remain valid in the output state.
