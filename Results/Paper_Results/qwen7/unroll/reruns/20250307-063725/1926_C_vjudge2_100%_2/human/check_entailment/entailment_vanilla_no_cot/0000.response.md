Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is unnecessary and inefficient because the input `n` can be any value up to 200,000, and the precomputed values are not reused efficiently.

2. **List Initialization**: The variable `A` is initialized but never used correctly. The sums should be computed dynamically for each test case, not stored in a list beforehand.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1` is defined but not called within the main loop where the sum needs to be calculated for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a += num % 10
        num //= 10
    return a

t = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    results.append(total_sum)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program avoids precomputation, computes the sum of digit sums dynamically for each test case, and prints the result for each test case.
