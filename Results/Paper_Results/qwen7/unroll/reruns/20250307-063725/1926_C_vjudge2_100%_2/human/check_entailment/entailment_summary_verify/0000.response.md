### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - This part of the program is correct and matches the function summary.

2. **Precomputed Array `A`**:
   - The array `A` is precomputed in the first loop, storing the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to 200,000.
   - This is done outside the main loop that processes the test cases.
   - For each test case, the program uses the precomputed value from `A` corresponding to `n - 1`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it prints the precomputed value from `A` corresponding to `n - 1`.

Given the constraints:
- \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)

The program will indeed work correctly because:
- The precomputed array `A` is large enough to cover the maximum possible value of `n` (200,000).
- Each test case will use the appropriate precomputed value from `A`, which is already calculated and stored.

The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because it uses a precomputed array `A` that is unnecessarily large and inefficient. However, this assessment is inaccurate because:
- The precomputed array `A` is only used for the specific `n` values encountered in each test case.
- The array size (200,000) is sufficient to handle the maximum possible input value (200,000).
- The program does not recompute the sums for each number up to `n` for each test case, which would be highly inefficient.

Therefore, the program is correct as it leverages the precomputed array efficiently without unnecessary recomputation.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem constraints and the provided function summary.
