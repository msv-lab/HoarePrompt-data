Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.
3. The current state is that `a` is 0 and `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `num != 0` must be true. Since `num` is already given as a positive integer within the specified range, it inherently satisfies the condition `num != 0`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the state of `num` to ensure the loop executes the first time.

Since the only variable in the loop head is `num`, and it already meets the condition, no changes are required.

State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
