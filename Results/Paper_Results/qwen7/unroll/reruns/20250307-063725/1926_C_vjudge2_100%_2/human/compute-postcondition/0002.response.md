Output State: **a is the sum of all digits in the original value of num.**

Explanation: The loop processes each digit of the number `num` by repeatedly taking the last digit (`num % 10`) and adding it to `a`, then removing the last digit from `num` (`int(num / 10)`). This continues until `num` becomes 0. Therefore, after the loop completes, `a` will hold the sum of all digits in the original value of `num`.
