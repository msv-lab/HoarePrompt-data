### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits. The solution involves precomputing the sum for all numbers up to 200,000 and storing these sums in a list `A`.

2. **Precomputation Check**:
   - The code attempts to precompute the sums for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 using a loop.
   - However, the loop runs from 1 to 200,000, which means it will take a significant amount of time, especially considering the constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case.
   - Given that there can be up to 10,000 test cases, this approach would be highly inefficient and likely exceed the time limit.

3. **Efficient Computation**:
   - Instead of precomputing all sums, we should compute the sum of digit sums for each test case directly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of digits of a number.
   - We need to iterate through each test case and compute the required sum dynamically.

4. **Code Analysis**:
   - The precomputed list `A` is not used correctly. The list `A` is populated with cumulative sums, which is unnecessary and incorrect for solving the problem.
   - The logic to handle multiple test cases is present but incorrectly uses the precomputed list `A`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, calculate the sum of digit sums from 1 to \( n \).
   - Use the function `func_1` to get the sum of digits for each number from 1 to \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it attempts to precompute all sums, which is inefficient and unnecessary. The correct approach is to compute the sum of digit sums for each test case directly.
