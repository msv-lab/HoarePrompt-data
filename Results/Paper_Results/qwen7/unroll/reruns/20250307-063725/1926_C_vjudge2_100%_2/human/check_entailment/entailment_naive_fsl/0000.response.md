Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the array `A` is precomputed and reused for all test cases, which means it will contain results for numbers up to 200,000. However, the problem statement limits `n` to \(2 \cdot 10^5\), but the input for each test case is read individually. This means that for inputs less than 200,000, the program will still use the precomputed values, which is unnecessary and inefficient. More importantly, for inputs greater than 200,000, the program will still use the precomputed values, which are not relevant to the current test case. 

To fix this, the program should compute the sum of the digits for each number up to `n` during each test case, rather than relying on a precomputed array. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    sum_of_digits = sum(func_1(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    print(sum_of_digits)
```

This version correctly computes the sum of the digits for each number up to `n` for each test case, ensuring that the program works correctly for all potential cases within the given constraints.
