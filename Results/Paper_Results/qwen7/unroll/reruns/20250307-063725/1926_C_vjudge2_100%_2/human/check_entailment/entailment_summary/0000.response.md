Reasoning:
1. The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums.
2. It then iterates through numbers from 1 to 200000, calculating the sum of digits for each number using the `func_1` function, and appending the result to the list `A`.
3. After precomputing the digit sums up to 200000, it reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by printing the corresponding value from the list `A`.
4. The `func_1` function correctly computes the sum of digits of a given number.
5. However, the approach of precomputing the results up to 200000 is unnecessary and inefficient for large values of `n` (up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)). This could lead to out-of-bound errors if `n` exceeds 200000.
6. Despite this inefficiency, the logic for computing the digit sum is correct and the precomputed results would be accurate for the range 1 to 200000.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the program will produce the correct results for `n` up to 200000. For larger values of `n`, the precomputation step would need to be adjusted, but within the specified range, the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
