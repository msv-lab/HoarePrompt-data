Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the count of elements equal to the median element in the sorted array `a` for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case, the code first decrements `t` (which starts at the number of test cases) until it reaches zero. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n` and the list of integers `a`. It then sorts the list `a`. If there is only one integer (`n == 1`), it prints `1`. Otherwise, it calculates the median index `mdx` and counts how many elements from `mdx` to the end of the list are equal to the median element, storing this count in `res`, and then prints `res`.

The output state is thus a sequence of these counts for each test case.
