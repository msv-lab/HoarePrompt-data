Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the median might be a value that needs to be incremented to a unique value higher than the current median. 

Consider the following example:

Input:
```
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
2
```

However, the program will output `1` because it only counts the number of elements equal to the median without ensuring that the median itself is incremented to a unique value. To correctly solve this problem, we need to ensure that the median is incremented to a value greater than the maximum of the array elements. The program should check if the median is already a unique value and increment it if necessary.
