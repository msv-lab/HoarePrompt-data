Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the count of elements equal to the median element in the sorted array `a` for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case, the code sorts the array `a`. If the length of the array `n` is 1, it prints 1 immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the median index `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. It then iterates from `mdx` to the end of the array, counting how many elements are equal to the median element `a[mdx]`. The result of this count is printed for each test case.
