Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. **Median Calculation**: The program calculates the median position correctly as `mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1` for even-sized arrays and `mdx = n // 2 - 1` for odd-sized arrays. However, the program incorrectly assumes that the median is the lower of the two middle elements for even-sized arrays. This is not accurate according to the problem statement.

2. **Counting Operations**: The program counts how many elements in the array are equal to the median element. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the need to increment elements to make them greater than the current median.

3. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem correctly, we need to:
   - Find the median value.
   - Count how many elements are less than or equal to the median.
   - Calculate the difference between the median and the next smallest element (or the median itself if it is unique).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            median = a[n // 2]
            count_less_equal = sum(1 for x in a if x <= median)
            min_operations = 0
            
            if n % 2 == 0:
                if a[n // 2 - 1] == median:
                    min_operations = 1
                else:
                    min_operations = median - a[n // 2 - 1]
            else:
                min_operations = median - a[n // 2]
            
            print(min_operations)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **False**
