Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function processes the array `a` and returns information based on the values in the array.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, which consists of `n` integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function processes these arrays and returns some form of output based on the values within the arrays, adhering to the constraints provided.
