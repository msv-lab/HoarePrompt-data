#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and the array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the count of elements equal to the median element in the sorted array `a` for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case, the code sorts the array `a`. If the length of the array `n` is 1, it prints 1 immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the median index `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. It then iterates from `mdx` to the end of the array, counting how many elements are equal to the median element `a[mdx]`. The result of this count is printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the array \( a \), determines the median element (if \( n \) is odd, the middle element; if even, the lower of the two middle elements), and counts how many elements in the array are equal to the median element. It then prints the count for each test case.
