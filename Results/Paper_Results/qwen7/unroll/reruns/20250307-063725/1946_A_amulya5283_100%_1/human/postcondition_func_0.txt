The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it sorts the array \( a \), determines the median element (if \( n \) is odd, the middle element; if even, the lower of the two middle elements), and counts how many elements in the array are equal to the median element. It then prints the count for each test case.
