You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and the array a contains n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            res = 0
            mdx = n // 2 + n % 2 - 1
            for i in range(mdx, n):
                if a[mdx] == a[i]:
                    res += 1
            print(res)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers, each representing the count of elements equal to the median element in the sorted array `a` for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case, the code sorts the array `a`. If the length of the array `n` is 1, it prints 1 immediately. Otherwise, it calculates the median index `mdx` as `n // 2 + n % 2 - 1`. It then iterates from `mdx` to the end of the array, counting how many elements are equal to the median element `a[mdx]`. The result of this count is printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `n` and an array `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, the function processes the array `a` and returns information based on the values in the array.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
