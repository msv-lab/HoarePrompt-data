Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `t`.
2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.
3. **Current state before the loop**: `t` is an input integer.

For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer and we don't have any additional information about its value right before the loop, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
