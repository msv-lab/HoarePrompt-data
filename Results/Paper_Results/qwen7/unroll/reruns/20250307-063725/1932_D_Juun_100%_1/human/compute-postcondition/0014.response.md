Output State: The output state will be a series of printed pairs of cards, each consisting of two cards from the `trumps` list, printed one after another until the list is empty. Each card is represented by its rank followed by the `trump` suit, and then another card in the same format.

For example, if `trumps` initially contains the ranks ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J'] and the `trump` suit is 'H', the output would look like:

```
AH KH
AQ QH
AJ JH
```

This continues until all cards in the `trumps` list have been paired and printed.
