Output State: **`trumps` is a sorted list in descending order, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values updated to None for suits that had a previous rank or an empty string for suits that did not have any comparisons.**

Explanation: The code `trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)` sorts the `trumps` list in descending order. Since the initial state of `trumps` is an empty list, sorting an empty list does not change its content. All other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
