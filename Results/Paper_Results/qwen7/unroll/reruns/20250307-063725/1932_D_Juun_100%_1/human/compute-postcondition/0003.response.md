Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, and `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `answers = []` initializes a new list named `answers` and assigns it an empty list. This does not affect the values of `trumps`, `t`, `n`, or the trump suit. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
