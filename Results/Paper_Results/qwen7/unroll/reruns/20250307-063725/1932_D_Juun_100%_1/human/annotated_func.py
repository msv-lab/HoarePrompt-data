#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of strings where each string is a two-character format representing the rank and suit of a card, with all cards being unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card

            trumps.append(rank)

    #State: Output State: `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values updated to None for suits that had a previous rank or an empty string for suits that did not have any comparisons.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue

            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:

            return
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values updated to None for suits that had a previous rank or an empty string for suits that did not have any comparisons. The loop iterates over each suit in `suits`. If the rank for a suit is not None, it checks if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is not empty, it appends a formatted string to `answers` with the rank and suit, and removes the last element from `trumps`. If `trumps` is empty, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, stopping the loop. After all iterations, if no 'IMPOSSIBLE' case was encountered, `trumps` will be an empty list.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed pairs of cards, each consisting of two cards from the `trumps` list, printed one after another until the list is empty. Each card is represented by its rank followed by the `trump` suit, and then another card in the same format.
    #
    #For example, if `trumps` initially contains the ranks ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J'] and the `trump` suit is 'H', the output would look like:
    #
    #```
    #AH KH
    #AQ QH
    #AJ JH
    #```
    #
    #This continues until all cards in the `trumps` list have been paired and printed.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed answers, each on a new line, based on the contents of the `answers` list. Each answer will be printed exactly as it appears in the list, with no additional formatting applied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of test cases, each including an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and a description of 2n unique cards. It identifies cards matching the trump suit and pairs them according to specific rules. The function then prints the results, which include pairs of cards from the trump suit and other comparisons made during processing. If certain conditions are met, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
