Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the number of rounds (`n`), the trump suit, and the list of cards.
3. The logic for determining the sequence of moves is mostly correct:
   - It handles trump cards appropriately by comparing them with non-trump cards.
   - It sorts and matches non-trump cards with the highest available non-trump card.
   - It correctly handles the case where no valid sequence can be formed.
4. The sorting and pairing of trump cards is done correctly, ensuring that higher-ranked trump cards are matched first.
5. The program prints the results in the required format, either the sequence of moves or "IMPOSSIBLE" if no valid sequence can be determined.

Given the above points, the program seems to handle all aspects of the problem correctly based on the provided states and the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
