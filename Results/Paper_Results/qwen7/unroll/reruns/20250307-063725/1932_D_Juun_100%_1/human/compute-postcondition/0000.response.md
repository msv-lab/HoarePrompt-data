Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and we read an input but did not process it yet.**

The `input()` function reads an input from the user but does not perform any processing on it. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. The output state includes the fact that an input has been read but not processed.
