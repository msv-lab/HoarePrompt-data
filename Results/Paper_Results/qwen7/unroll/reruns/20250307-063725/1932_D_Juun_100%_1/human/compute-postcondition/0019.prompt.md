You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is one of "CDHS", and the description of 2n cards consists of strings where each string is a two-character format representing the rank and suit of a card, with all cards being unique.
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is a list containing ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values updated to None for suits that had a previous rank or an empty string for suits that did not have any comparisons.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values updated to None for suits that had a previous rank or an empty string for suits that did not have any comparisons. The loop iterates over each suit in `suits`. If the rank for a suit is not None, it checks if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is not empty, it appends a formatted string to `answers` with the rank and suit, and removes the last element from `trumps`. If `trumps` is empty, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, stopping the loop. After all iterations, if no 'IMPOSSIBLE' case was encountered, `trumps` will be an empty list.
    trumps = sorted(trumps, reverse=True)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed pairs of cards, each consisting of two cards from the `trumps` list, printed one after another until the list is empty. Each card is represented by its rank followed by the `trump` suit, and then another card in the same format.
    #
    #For example, if `trumps` initially contains the ranks ['A', 'K', 'Q', 'J'] and the `trump` suit is 'H', the output would look like:
    #
    #```
    #AH KH
    #AQ QH
    #AJ JH
    #```
    #
    #This continues until all cards in the `trumps` list have been paired and printed.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of printed answers, each on a new line, based on the contents of the `answers` list. Each answer will be printed exactly as it appears in the list, with no additional formatting applied.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies a set of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 16), a trump suit ("CDHS"), and a description of 2n unique cards represented in a two-character format (rank and suit). The function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the given conditions.
