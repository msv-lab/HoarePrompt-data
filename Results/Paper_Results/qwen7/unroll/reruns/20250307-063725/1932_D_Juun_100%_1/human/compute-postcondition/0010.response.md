Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and values updated to None for suits that had a previous rank or an empty string for suits that did not have any comparisons. The loop iterates over each suit in `suits`. If the rank for a suit is not None, it checks if `trumps` is not empty. If `trumps` is not empty, it appends a formatted string to `answers` with the rank and suit, and removes the last element from `trumps`. If `trumps` is empty, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns, stopping the loop. After all iterations, if no 'IMPOSSIBLE' case was encountered, `trumps` will be an empty list.
