Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input value from the user, and we read an input but did not process it yet.**

The code initializes an empty list named `trumps`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. The input read but not processed yet also remains unaffected.
