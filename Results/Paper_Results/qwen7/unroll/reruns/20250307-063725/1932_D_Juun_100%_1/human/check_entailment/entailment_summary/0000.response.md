Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly identifies the trump suit and splits the input into individual cards.
3. It handles the pairing of cards based on the rules provided:
   - Cards of the trump suit are paired with non-trump cards if they have a higher rank.
   - Non-trump cards are paired based on their suits and ranks.
4. The program correctly handles the scenario where there are no possible pairs for non-trump cards by printing "IMPOSSIBLE".
5. The sorting and popping operations ensure that the output follows the required format and order.

Given the execution summary and the analysis above, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
