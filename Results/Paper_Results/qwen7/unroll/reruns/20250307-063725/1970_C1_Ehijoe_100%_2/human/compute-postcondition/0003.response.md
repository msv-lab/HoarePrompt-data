Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list; `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

Explanation: The code initializes `nodes` as a defaultdict with the default factory set to `list`. This means that `nodes` is a dictionary where each key maps to a list by default. However, no nodes or edges are added to this dictionary, so it remains empty. All other variables retain their initial states.
