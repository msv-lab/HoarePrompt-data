Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `edges` is a list of n-1 edges represented as pairs (u, v), `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with only one adjacent node), `s` is the first element of the list `ends`, `e` is the second element of the list `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of the list `ends`, `prev` is the first element of the list `ends`, `curr` is the first element of the list of adjacent nodes of `s`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
