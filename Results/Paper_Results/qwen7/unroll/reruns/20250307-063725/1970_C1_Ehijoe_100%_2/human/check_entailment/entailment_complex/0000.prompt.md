Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

    #State: Output State: `empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `edges` is a list of n-1 edges represented as pairs (u, v), `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes.

    s, e = list(ends)
    tree = [s]
    prev = s

    while curr != e:

    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: 'Ron'
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: Hermione
    #State: Postcondition: `tree` contains all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal, with the additional element `e` appended to it; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If at least one move in `moves` is odd, the postcondition remains as described in the if part. If all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the postcondition remains as described in the else part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure defined by a series of edges and determines whether Ron or Hermione wins based on the parity of certain moves. It first constructs a tree by traversing from a start node to an end node, then calculates the number of moves required to reach the end node from the start node. If at least one of these moves is odd, it prints 'Ron'; otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'.
