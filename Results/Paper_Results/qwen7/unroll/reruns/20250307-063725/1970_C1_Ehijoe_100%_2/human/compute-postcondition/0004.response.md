Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `n - 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**: 
   - The initial value of `i` is not specified, but it will start from 0 because the loop runs from `range(n - 1)`.
   - The value of `n` is given as an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts from 0, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n - 1` for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to run at least once (since `n - 1` must be at least 1).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be at least 2.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be at least 2**
