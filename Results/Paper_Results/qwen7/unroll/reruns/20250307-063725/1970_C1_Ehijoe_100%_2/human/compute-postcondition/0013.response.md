Output State: **`empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n, `edges` is a list of n-1 edges represented as pairs (u, v), `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and each key in `nodes` corresponds to a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, `ends` is a list containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with only one adjacent node), `s` is the first element of the list `ends`, `e` is the second element of the list `ends`, `tree` is a list containing the first element of the list `ends`, `prev` is the first element of the list `ends`.**

Explanation: The line `prev = s` assigns the value of `s` to the variable `prev`. Since `s` is the first element of the list `ends`, `prev` now holds the same value as `s`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
