Output State: **`tree` contains all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal, with the additional element `e` appended to it; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of the `start` value within the list `tree` and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
