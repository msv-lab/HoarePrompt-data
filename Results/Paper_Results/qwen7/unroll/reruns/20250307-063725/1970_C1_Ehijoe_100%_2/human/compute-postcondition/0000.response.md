Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `n` and `t` are assigned the values from input.**

The code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `t`. Since `t` was initially set to 1, it remains unchanged. The values of `u` and `v` are not affected by the input, so they retain their initial constraints. The list of starting nodes is also unaffected.
