Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the program calculates the distance of the starting node from the two leaves and determines the winner based on whether the sum of these distances is odd or even. However, this approach does not account for the optimal strategy of the players.

To illustrate, consider the following input:

```
Input:
7 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 6
6 7
3
```

In this case, the tree can be visualized as follows:
```
      1
       \
        2
         \
          3
           \
            4
             \
              5
               \
                6
                 \
                  7
```

The two leaves are nodes 3 and 7. The distance from the starting node (3) to node 3 is 0, and the distance to node 7 is 4. The sum of these distances is 4, which is even. According to the program, Hermione would win. However, let's analyze the game:

1. Ron starts with the stone on node 3.
2. Ron can move the stone to node 4.
3. Hermione can then move the stone to node 5.
4. Ron can move the stone to node 6.
5. Hermione can then move the stone to node 7.
6. Ron cannot make a move since all neighbors of node 7 are already active.

Thus, Ron loses the round, which contradicts the program's output. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
