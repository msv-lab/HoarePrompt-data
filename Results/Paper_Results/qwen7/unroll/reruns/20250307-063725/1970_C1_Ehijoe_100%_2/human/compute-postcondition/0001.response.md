Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. The values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the list of starting nodes remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state includes these unchanged variables along with the newly initialized `edges` list.
