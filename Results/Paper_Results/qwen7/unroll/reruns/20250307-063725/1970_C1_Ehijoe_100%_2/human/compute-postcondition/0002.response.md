Output State: **`empty` is True, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `edges` is an empty list.**

The code sets the variable `empty` to `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
