Postcondition: `tree` contains all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal, with the additional element `e` appended to it; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If at least one move in `moves` is odd, the postcondition remains as described in the if part. If all elements in `moves` are even numbers, the postcondition remains as described in the else part.
