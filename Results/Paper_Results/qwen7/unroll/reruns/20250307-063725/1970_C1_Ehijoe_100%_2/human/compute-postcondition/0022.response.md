Based on the initial state provided:

- `tree` contains all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal, with the additional element `e` appended to it.
- `start` is an input integer.
- `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.
- `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. Here, `n` is the length of `tree`.
- At least one move in `moves` is odd.

The `print('Ron')` statement simply prints the string `'Ron'`.

Output: **'Ron'**
