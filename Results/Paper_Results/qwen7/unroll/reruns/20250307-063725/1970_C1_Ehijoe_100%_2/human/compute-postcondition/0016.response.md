Output State: **The variable `tree` will contain all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal.**

Explanation: The loop traverses the path from the start node `s` to the end node `e` in the tree structure. It starts from `s` and follows the adjacency list to move to the next node, appending each visited node to the `tree` list. The loop continues until it reaches `e`. Since `s` and `e` are the first and second elements of the `ends` list respectively, which contains all leaf nodes, the `tree` list will be constructed by traversing from the first leaf node to the second leaf node along the tree's branches.
