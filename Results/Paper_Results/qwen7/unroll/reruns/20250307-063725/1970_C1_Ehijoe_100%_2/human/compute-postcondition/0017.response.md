Output State: **The variable `tree` will now contain all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal, with the additional element `e` appended to it.**

This means that the list `tree` originally contained all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e`. After executing the line `tree.append(e)`, the element `e` has been added to the end of the list `tree`.
