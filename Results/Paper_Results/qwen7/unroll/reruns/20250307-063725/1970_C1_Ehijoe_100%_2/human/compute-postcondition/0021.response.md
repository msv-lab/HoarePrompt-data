Postcondition: **`tree` contains all the leaf nodes from `s` to `e` in the order they are visited during the traversal, with the additional element `e` appended to it; `start` is an input integer; `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. At least one move in `moves` is odd.**
