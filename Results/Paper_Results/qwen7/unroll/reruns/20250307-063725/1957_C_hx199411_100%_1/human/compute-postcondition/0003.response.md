Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed based on the input provided within each iteration of the loop. Each integer represents the result of the computation for a given set of inputs \(n\) and \(k\), and their corresponding pairs \((c, r)\).

To break it down:
- For each iteration, the value of \(t\) is decremented until it reaches 0.
- Within each iteration, the user provides two integers \(n\) and \(k\).
- Then, \(k\) pairs of integers \((c, r)\) are provided.
- The variable `num` is updated based on the comparison between \(c\) and \(r\): if they are equal, `num` increases by 1; otherwise, it increases by 2.
- After processing all pairs, `m` is calculated as \(n - num\).
- Depending on the value of `m`, the script prints either 1 or computes and prints a value from a dynamic programming array `dp`.

The final output state is the sequence of printed integers, each representing the result of the computation for the respective input sets.
