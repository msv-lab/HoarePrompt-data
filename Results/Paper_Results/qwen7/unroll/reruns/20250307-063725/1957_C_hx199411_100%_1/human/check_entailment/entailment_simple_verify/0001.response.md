### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors your moves unless the move is along the diagonal. We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \(k\) moves.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move (you or the computer) removes one or two positions from being available due to the rook placements.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (\(r = c\)), only one position is removed.
   - If a move is not on the diagonal, two positions are removed (one for each rook).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code correctly counts the number of positions removed by the previous moves (`num`).
   - The remaining positions (`m = n - num`) are calculated.
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \(i\) positions.
   - Base cases:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One position can be placed in one way.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Two positions can be placed in 3 ways (both empty, one with a rook, or both with rooks).
   - For \(i \geq 3\):
     - Placing a rook in the last position gives `dp[i-1]` ways.
     - Not placing a rook in the last position and placing a rook in the second last position gives \((i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \cdot 2\) ways (since there are \(i-1\) choices for the second last position and 2 ways to place rooks in the last two positions).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, only one configuration is possible (no rooks left).
   - If `m == 1`, only one configuration is possible (one position with a rook).

### Evaluation of the Code:

- **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- **Position Counting**: The code accurately counts the number of positions removed by the previous moves. This is done using the variable `num`.
- **Remaining Positions Calculation**: The calculation of `m = n - num` is correct.
- **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The base cases for the dynamic programming array `dp` are correctly initialized.
- **Dynamic Programming Transition**: The transition formula in the dynamic programming loop is correct. It considers both placing a rook in the last position and not placing a rook in the last position but placing one in the second last position.
- **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is appropriate to handle large numbers.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the code and the provided annotations, the code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations based on the given constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate and handles the problem as described.
