Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed based on the input values provided within each iteration of the loop. Specifically, for each set of inputs `(n, k)` followed by `k` pairs of integers `(c, r)`, the code calculates a value `m` as `n - num`, where `num` is incremented based on the conditions given. If `m` equals 0 or 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it uses dynamic programming to compute a value stored in `dp[m]` and prints it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The exact output depends on the specific inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Since the initial state of `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), and each iteration decrements `t` until it reaches 0, the final output will consist of up to \(t\) lines, each containing either "1" or a computed value from the dynamic programming array `dp`.
