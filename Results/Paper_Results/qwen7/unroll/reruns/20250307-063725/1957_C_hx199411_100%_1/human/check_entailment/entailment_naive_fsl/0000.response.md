Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for calculating `num` is incorrect. The variable `num` is intended to count the number of unique positions (rows and columns) that have been occupied by rooks so far. However, the current implementation does not accurately reflect this:

1. When `c != r`, it adds 2 to `num`, which is correct because it accounts for both the white and black rooks.
2. When `c == r`, it only adds 1 to `num`, which is incorrect because it should add 2 (one for the white rook and one for the black rook).

To fix this, the logic for incrementing `num` should be corrected to handle both cases properly. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 2
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

This corrected version ensures that `num` accurately counts the number of unique positions occupied by rooks, and thus the calculation of `m` and the final configurations is correct.
