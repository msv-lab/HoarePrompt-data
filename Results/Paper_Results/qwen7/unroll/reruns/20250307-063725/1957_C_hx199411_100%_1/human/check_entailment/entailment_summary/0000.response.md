Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves calculating the number of unique final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent unless the move is along the diagonal.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move eliminates one potential rook placement in terms of rows and columns.
   - Moves on the diagonal (where \(r = c\)) reduce the effective number of available placements by 1 instead of 2.
   - The remaining positions form a subgrid where no two rooks can be placed in the same row or column.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The code correctly initializes a DP array to store the number of ways to place rooks in a subgrid of size \(m \times m\).
   - The base cases are handled correctly: \(dp[1] = 1\) and \(dp[2] = 3\).
   - For larger subgrids, the recurrence relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) is used, which accounts for placing a rook in one of the \(i\) rows and then recursively solving for the remaining subgrid.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \(m = 0\), the only configuration is the empty board, hence `1`.
   - When \(m = 1\), the only configuration is placing one rook, hence `1`.

5. **Input Handling**:
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each case independently.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to calculate the number of unique final configurations based on the problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
