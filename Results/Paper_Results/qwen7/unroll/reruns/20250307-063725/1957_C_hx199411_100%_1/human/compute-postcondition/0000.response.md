Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid after the code is executed, and no other variables are affected.
