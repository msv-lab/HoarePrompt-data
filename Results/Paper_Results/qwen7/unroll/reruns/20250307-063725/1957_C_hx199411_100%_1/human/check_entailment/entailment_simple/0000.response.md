Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves `k`. It also correctly processes the coordinates `(r, c)` for each move.

2. **Counting Non-Attacking Moves**: The program counts the number of non-mirrored moves (`num`). This is done correctly by adding 1 to `num` if `c == r` (indicating a mirrored move by the computer) and 2 otherwise (indicating a non-mirrored move).

3. **Calculating Remaining Moves**: The variable `m` is calculated as `n - num`, which represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming for Configurations**: The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions. The base cases are correctly initialized, and the recurrence relation is applied correctly to compute the number of configurations for `m` positions.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The final result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required by the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program logic appears to be correct and follows the rules specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
