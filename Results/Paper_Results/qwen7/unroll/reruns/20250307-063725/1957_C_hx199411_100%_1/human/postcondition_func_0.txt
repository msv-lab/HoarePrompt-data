The function processes multiple test cases, where each case consists of integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(k\) pairs of integers \((c, r)\). It calculates the number of non-attacking rook positions and uses dynamic programming to compute a result based on the difference between \(n\) and this count. The function outputs a series of integers, one for each test case, indicating the result of the computation.
