### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors your moves unless the move is along the diagonal. We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \(k\) moves.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move (you or the computer) removes one or two positions from being available due to the rook placements.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (\(r = c\)), only one position is removed.
   - If a move is not on the diagonal, two positions are removed (one for each rook).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code correctly counts the number of positions removed by the previous moves (`num`).
   - The remaining positions (`m = n - num`) are calculated.
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \(i\) positions.
   - Base cases:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One position can be placed in one way.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Two positions can be placed in 3 ways (both empty, one with a rook, or both with rooks).
   - For \(i \geq 3\):
     - Placing a rook in the last position gives `dp[i-1]` ways.
     - Not placing a rook in the last position and placing a rook in the second last position gives \((i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \cdot 2\) ways (since there are \(i-1\) choices for the second last position and 2 ways to place rooks in the last two positions).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, only one configuration is possible (no rooks left).
   - If `m == 1`, only one configuration is possible (one position with a rook).

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the dynamic programming implementation. Specifically, the recurrence relation used in the dynamic programming step is incorrect. The formula \((i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \cdot 2\) does not correctly account for the placement of rooks in the remaining positions.

### Detailed Analysis:

- The recurrence relation should consider the fact that placing a rook in the last position leaves \(i-1\) positions, and the number of ways to place rooks in those positions is `dp[i-1]`.
- Additionally, not placing a rook in the last position and placing a rook in the second last position leaves \(i-2\) positions, and the number of ways to place rooks in those positions is `dp[i-2]`.

The correct recurrence relation should be:
\[ dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \]

### Corrected Code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for _ in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 2
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the dynamic programming recurrence relation was flawed. The corrected recurrence relation should be \( dp[i] = dp[i-1] + (i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \).
