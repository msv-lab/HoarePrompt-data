### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors your moves unless the move is along the diagonal. We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \(k\) moves.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move (you or the computer) removes one or two positions from being available due to the rook placements.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (\(r = c\)), only one position is removed.
   - If a move is not on the diagonal, two positions are removed (one for each rook).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code correctly counts the number of positions removed by the previous moves (`num`).
   - The remaining positions (`m = n - num`) are calculated.
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \(i\) positions.
   - Base cases:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One position can be placed in one way.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Two positions can be placed in 3 ways (both empty, one with a rook, or both with rooks).
   - For \(i \geq 3\):
     - Placing a rook in the last position gives `dp[i-1]` ways.
     - Not placing a rook in the last position and placing a rook in the second last position gives \((i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \cdot 2\) ways (since there are \(i-1\) choices for the second last position and 2 ways to place rooks in the last two positions).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, only one configuration is possible (no rooks left).
   - If `m == 1`, only one configuration is possible (one position with a rook).

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
  - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq n\).
  - Coordinates \((r_i, c_i)\) for each of the \(k\) moves you made are integers such that \(1 \leq r_i, c_i \leq n\), and no two rooks attack each other based on the given rules.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - The code correctly reads the input values for \(n\) and \(k\).
  - It iterates through the \(k\) moves, updating `num` based on whether the move is on the diagonal or not.
  - The remaining positions `m` are calculated as \(n - num\).
  - The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized and filled according to the given recurrence relation.
  - The result is computed and printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

- **Dynamic Programming Correctness**:
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correct.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.
  - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required bounds.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `m == 0`, the code correctly prints `1`.
  - When `m == 1`, the code also correctly prints `1`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations based on the given constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate and handles the problem as described.
