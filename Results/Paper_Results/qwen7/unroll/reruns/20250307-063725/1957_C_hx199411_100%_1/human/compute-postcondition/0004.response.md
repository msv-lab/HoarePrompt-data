Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each case includes an integer t, followed by n, k, and k pairs of integers (r_i, c_i). It verifies that the coordinates (r_i, c_i) for each of the k moves do not allow any two rooks to attack each other based on the given rules, and returns whether each test case is valid or not.**

This means the function is designed to validate a series of test cases involving rook movements on a board. Each test case includes the number of test cases (t), the size of the board (n), the number of moves (k), and the coordinates of each move. The function checks if these moves are valid according to the rule that no two rooks can attack each other (which typically means they cannot share the same row or column). The function then returns a result indicating the validity of each test case.
