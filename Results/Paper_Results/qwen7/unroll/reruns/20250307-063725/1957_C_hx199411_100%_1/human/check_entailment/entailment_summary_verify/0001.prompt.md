You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each case consists of integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(k\) pairs of integers \((c, r)\). It calculates the number of non-attacking rook positions and uses dynamic programming to compute a result based on the difference between \(n\) and this count. The function outputs a series of integers, one for each test case, indicating the result of the computation.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. You and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors your moves unless the move is along the diagonal. We need to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after \(k\) moves.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move (you or the computer) removes one or two positions from being available due to the rook placements.
   - If a move is on the diagonal (\(r = c\)), only one position is removed.
   - If a move is not on the diagonal, two positions are removed (one for each rook).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code correctly counts the number of positions removed by the previous moves (`num`).
   - The remaining positions (`m = n - num`) are calculated.
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to count the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions, considering the constraints.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to place rooks in \(i\) positions.
   - Base cases:
     - `dp[1] = 1`: One position can be placed in one way.
     - `dp[2] = 3`: Two positions can be placed in 3 ways (both empty, one with a rook, or both with rooks).
   - For \(i \geq 3\):
     - Placing a rook in the last position gives `dp[i-1]` ways.
     - Not placing a rook in the last position and placing a rook in the second last position gives \((i-1) \cdot dp[i-2] \cdot 2\) ways (since there are \(i-1\) choices for the second last position and 2 ways to place rooks in the last two positions).

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `m == 0`, only one configuration is possible (no rooks left).
   - If `m == 1`, only one configuration is possible (one position with a rook).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations based on the given constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate and handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
