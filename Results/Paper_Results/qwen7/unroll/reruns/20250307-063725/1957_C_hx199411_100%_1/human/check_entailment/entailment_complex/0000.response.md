Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`. It then reads `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program correctly identifies whether the rook placements are mirrored (`c == r`), adding 1 to `num` if so, and 2 otherwise. This logic ensures that the number of independent rook placements is accurately counted.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The program initializes a DP array `dp` to store intermediate results for calculating the number of configurations. The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly set up.

4. **DP Transition**: The transition formula `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `m` empty slots, which is derived from `m = n - num`.

5. **Output**: The program correctly handles the special cases where `m` is 0 or 1, printing 1 in those cases. For other values of `m`, it uses the precomputed DP table to find the number of configurations.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly compute the number of valid final configurations for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
