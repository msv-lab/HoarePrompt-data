Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`**: The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique positions (rows and columns) that have been used so far. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, if `c == r`, it should only increment `num` by 1 because the computer's mirrored move doesn't add a new unique position. If `c != r`, it should increment `num` by 2.

2. **Dynamic Programming Initialization and Logic**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized incorrectly. The base cases and the recurrence relation need to be adjusted to correctly calculate the number of configurations.

3. **Modulo Operation**: While the modulo operation is applied in the recurrence relation, it should be applied more consistently throughout the calculation.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for _ in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % MOD
            print(dp[m])

func()
```

### Explanation of Corrections:
1. **Correct Calculation of `num`**: The variable `num` now correctly counts the number of unique positions used.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: The base cases and the recurrence relation are correctly set up.
3. **Modulo Operation**: The modulo operation is consistently applied throughout the calculation.

This corrected version should provide the correct number of possible final configurations for each test case.
