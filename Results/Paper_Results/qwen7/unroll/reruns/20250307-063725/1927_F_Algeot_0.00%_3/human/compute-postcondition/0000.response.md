Output State: **`sys.recursionlimit` is set to 1000000, t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), and the following edges (u, v, w) are given where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices, and the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The code sets the recursion limit to \(10^6\) using `sys.setrecursionlimit(10 ** 6)`. This changes the value of the `sys.recursionlimit` variable. However, the initial state regarding the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, and the edges are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, these conditions remain as stated in the initial state.
