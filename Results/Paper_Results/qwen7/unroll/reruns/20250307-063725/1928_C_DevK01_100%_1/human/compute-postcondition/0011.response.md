Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` represents the position in the line, and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. The function calculates and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1`. If `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and greater than or equal to `x-1`, `w` is included in the list `M`. The function iterates through all numbers less than the square root of `q` to find other divisors that meet the condition and adds them to the list `M`.**
