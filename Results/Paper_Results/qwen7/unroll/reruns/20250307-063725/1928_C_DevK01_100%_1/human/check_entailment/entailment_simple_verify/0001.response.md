### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x`
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because if `y` is odd, there is no valid `k` that fits the conditions.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer.
   - It then iterates through all possible divisors of `q` and adds those that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates `L1` using `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.
   - It removes duplicates from `L1` using `set` and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0` because no valid `k` exists.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

2. **Logic for Finding Valid `k`:**
   - The formula `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` is derived from the periodicity of the settling pattern.
   - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that we consider the correct segment of the settling pattern.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using `set` to remove duplicates before calculating the length ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

### Key Points to Verify:

- **Divisor Calculation:** The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- **Periodicity Consideration:** The formulas `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` correctly capture the periodicity of the settling pattern.
- **Edge Case Handling:** The program correctly handles the case where `y` is odd by printing `0`.

### Conclusion:

Upon re-evaluating the program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program correctly identifies the number of valid `k` values for each test case.
