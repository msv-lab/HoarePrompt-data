Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values for \( k \) given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \). Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic to calculate the possible values of \( k \) is flawed.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`. However, this calculation does not align with the problem description. The correct value of `y` should be derived from the periodicity of the settling pattern.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a number, but its usage in the main logic is incorrect. The logic inside `func_1` does not properly account for the constraints of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors:**
   - The logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the periodicity and constraints of the settling pattern.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `10 2`:
- According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
- For \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the correct \( k \) values should be 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid \( k \) values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of possible \( k \) values for every input, making it incorrect.
