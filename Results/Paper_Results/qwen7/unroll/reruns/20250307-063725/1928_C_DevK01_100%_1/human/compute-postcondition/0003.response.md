Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q), `M` is a list containing one element which is the square root of `q`, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` (which is the square root of `q`) to the list `M`. Since `w` is already defined as the square root of `q` and is an integer, `M` now contains `[w]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
