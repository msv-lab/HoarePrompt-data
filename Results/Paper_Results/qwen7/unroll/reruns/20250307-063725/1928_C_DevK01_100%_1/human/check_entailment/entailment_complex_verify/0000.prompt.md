You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q).
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q), `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `w` is the square root of `q`, and if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` remains unchanged; otherwise, `M` and `w` remain as initially defined.

        if q % i == 0:

    #State: The value of `M` is a list of divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1`.
    return M
    #The program returns a list `M` of divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` represents the position in the line, and `x` represents the number Vasya received during the settling. The function calculates and returns a list `M` containing all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1`. If `w` (the square root of `q`) is an integer and greater than or equal to `x-1`, `w` is included in the list `M`. The function iterates through all numbers less than the square root of `q` to find other divisors that meet the condition and adds them to the list `M`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the number of possible values for \( k \) given Vasya's position \( n \) and the number he received \( x \). Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic to calculate the possible values of \( k \) is flawed.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `y`:**
   - The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`. However, this calculation does not align with the problem description. The correct value of `y` should be derived from the periodicity of the settling pattern.

2. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find divisors of a number, but its usage in the main logic is incorrect. The logic inside `func_1` does not properly account for the constraints of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Divisors:**
   - The logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly handle the periodicity and constraints of the settling pattern.

To illustrate, let's consider the test case `10 2`:
- According to the problem description, the settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
- For \( n = 10 \) and \( x = 2 \), the correct \( k \) values should be 2, 3, 5, and 6. However, the program incorrectly calculates the number of valid \( k \) values.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine the number of possible \( k \) values for every input, making it incorrect.
