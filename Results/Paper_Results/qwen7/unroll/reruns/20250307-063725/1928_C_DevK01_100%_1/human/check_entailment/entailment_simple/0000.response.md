Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining how many values of \( k \) satisfy the conditions given the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received during the "first-k-th" settling process. The settling process repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) Vasya received must fit into the repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

3. **Analysis of the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with parameters derived from \( y \) and \( x \).
   - `func_1` computes the divisors of \( q \) (where \( q = \frac{y - 2}{2} \)) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - These divisors represent potential values of \( k \) that could fit the given constraints.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of \( q \) that meet the criteria.
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case and prints the count of valid \( k \) values.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 immediately.
   - The code ensures that \( k > 1 \) by checking the divisors appropriately.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
