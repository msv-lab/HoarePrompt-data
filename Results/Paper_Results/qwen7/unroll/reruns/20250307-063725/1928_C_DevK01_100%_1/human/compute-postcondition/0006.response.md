Output State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q), `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `w` is the square root of `q`, and if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` remains unchanged; otherwise, `M` and `w` remain as initially defined.**

Explanation: The variable `i` is assigned the value 1. No other changes are made to the other variables (`q`, `x`, `M`, `w`). Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions of these variables while updating `i` to 1.
