Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q), `M` is a list containing one element which is the square root of `q`, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `w` is an integer. If `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` remains the square root of `q` and `M` contains the square root of `q`. If `w` is not an integer or less than `x - 1`, the values of `q`, `x`, `M`, and `w` remain unchanged.
