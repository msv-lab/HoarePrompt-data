Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 <= x < n <= 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 <= x < q), `M` is a list containing the square root of `q`, `w` is the square root of `q`, and if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` remains unchanged; otherwise, `M` and `w` remain as initially defined.
