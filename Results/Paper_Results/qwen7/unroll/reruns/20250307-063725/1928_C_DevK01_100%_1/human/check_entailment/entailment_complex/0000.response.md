Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining how many values of \( k \) fit the given constraints, where \( k > 1 \). The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya are provided.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya must fit within this repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of \( q = n + x - 2 \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly identifies all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It includes the square root of \( q \) if it is an integer and greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It iterates through all numbers less than the square root of \( q \) to find other divisors that meet the condition.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - It handles the case where \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) by calling `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and then the length of the set is printed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0 immediately.
   - The logic for handling \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) ensures that all possible values of \( k \) are considered.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid \( k \) values for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
