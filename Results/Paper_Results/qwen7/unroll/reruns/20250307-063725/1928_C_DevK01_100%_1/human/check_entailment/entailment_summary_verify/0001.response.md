### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic in the program. However, let's break down the program and the function summaries in more detail to ensure there are no overlooked issues.

1. **Reading Input and Setting Up:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received.

2. **Calculating `y`:**
   - `y = n + x`
   - If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is because if `y` is odd, there is no valid `k` that fits the conditions.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer.
   - It then iterates through all possible divisors of `q` and adds those that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to the list `M`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates `L1` using `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the results of `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to `L1`.
   - It removes duplicates from `L1` using `set` and prints the length of the resulting list.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `y` is odd, the program correctly prints `0` because no valid `k` exists.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds all divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

2. **Logic for Finding Valid `k`:**
   - The formula `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` is derived from the periodicity of the settling pattern.
   - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that we consider the correct segment of the settling pattern.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using `set` to remove duplicates before calculating the length ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

### Potential Issues:

- **Divisor Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` correctly identifies divisors, but we need to ensure that the logic for finding valid `k` values is correct.
  - Specifically, the condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` might not always cover all valid segments of the settling pattern.

### Verification:

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `10 2`
  - `y = 10 + 2 = 12` (even), so we proceed.
  - `func_1((12 - 2) // 2, 2) = func_1(5, 2)` gives divisors `[2, 5]`.
  - Since `n = 10` and `3 * x - 2 = 4`, we also consider `func_1((10 - 2) // 2, 2) = func_1(4, 2)` which gives divisors `[2, 4]`.
  - Combining and removing duplicates: `{2, 4, 5}`. Length is `3`, but the original assessment says `4`. This discrepancy needs further investigation.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `3 1`
  - `y = 3 + 1 = 4` (even), so we proceed.
  - `func_1((4 - 2) // 2, 1) = func_1(1, 1)` gives divisors `[1]`.
  - Since `n = 3` and `3 * x - 2 = 1`, we also consider `func_1((3 - 1) // 2, 1) = func_1(1, 1)` which gives divisors `[1]`.
  - Combining and removing duplicates: `{1}`. Length is `1`, which matches the output.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `76 4`
  - `y = 76 + 4 = 80` (even), so we proceed.
  - `func_1((80 - 2) // 2, 4) = func_1(39, 4)` gives divisors `[4, 39]`.
  - Since `n = 76` and `3 * x - 2 = 10`, we also consider `func_1((76 - 4) // 2, 4) = func_1(36, 4)` which gives divisors `[4, 9, 36]`.
  - Combining and removing duplicates: `{4, 9, 36, 39}`. Length is `4`, which matches the output.

- **Example 4:**
  - Input: `100 99`
  - `y = 100 + 99 = 199` (odd), so we print `0`.

- **Example 5:**
  - Input: `1000000000 500000000`
  - `y = 1000000000 + 500000000 = 1500000000` (even), so we proceed.
  - `func_1((1500000000 - 2) // 2, 500000000) = func_1(749999999, 500000000)` gives divisors `[500000000, 749999999]`.
  - Since `n = 1000000000` and `3 * x - 2 = 1500000000 - 2 = 1499999998`, we do not consider any additional segments.
  - Combining and removing duplicates: `{500000000, 749999999}`. Length is `2`, but the original assessment says `1`. This discrepancy needs further investigation.

### Conclusion:

Upon closer inspection, the original assessment seems to have missed some valid `k` values in certain cases. Specifically, the condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` might not always capture all valid segments of the settling pattern. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
