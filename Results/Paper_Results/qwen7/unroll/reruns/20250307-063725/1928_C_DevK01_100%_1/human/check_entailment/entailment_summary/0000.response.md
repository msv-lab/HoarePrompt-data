Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya during the settling process can be explained by the described pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya must fit into this pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors of a specific value related to \( n \) and \( x \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even. If not, it prints 0 and continues.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with parameters derived from \( y \) and \( x \).
   - `func_1` finds divisors of \( q = \frac{y - 2}{2} \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - These divisors are added to a set to avoid duplicates, and the size of the set is printed.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies potential values of \( k \) by finding divisors of \( q \) that are relevant to the settling pattern.
   - The main code correctly handles the input and output as specified.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where \( y \) is odd by printing 0.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the expected results based on the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
