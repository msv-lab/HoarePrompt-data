Based on the initial state provided:

- `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.
- `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`.
- `ops` is a list constructed based on the length of `path_ba`.

To determine what will be printed, let's analyze the construction of `ops`:

1. If the length of `path_ba` is odd:
   - For each `i` in the range from 0 to `len(path_ba) - 1`, the tuple `(c, i)` is added to `ops`, where `c` is the element at index `i` in `path_ba`.

2. If the length of `path_ba` is even:
   - For each iteration where `i` ranges from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of 2, the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` are added to `ops`, where `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.

The length of `ops` will be determined by the number of elements in `path_ba` and how they are processed according to the rules above. Regardless of whether the length of `path_ba` is odd or even, the total number of elements in `ops` will be equal to the length of `path_ba`.

Therefore, the print statement `print(len(ops))` will output the length of `path_ba`.

Output: **len(path_ba)**
