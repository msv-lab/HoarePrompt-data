Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`, and `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code snippet initializes an empty list named `ops`. This operation does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, `d`, or `previous`. The `path_ba` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `d`, `previous`, and `path_ba` remain as they were in the initial state, while `ops` is now an empty list.
