Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `d`, `previous`, or `b` itself. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
