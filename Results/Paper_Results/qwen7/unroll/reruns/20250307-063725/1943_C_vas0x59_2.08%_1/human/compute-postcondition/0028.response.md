To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `a` and `b` are both the result of `func_1(d)`. This means `a` and `b` have the same value.
   - `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.
   - `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`.
   - `ops` is a list containing specific tuples based on the length of `path_ba`.

2. **Code Snippet Analysis:**
   - The code uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each element in `ops`.
   - The lambda function takes each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops` and formats it as a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.
   - The `*map(...)` part unpacks the map object into separate arguments, and `sep='\n'` ensures each argument is printed on a new line.

3. **Determining the Value of `ops`:**
   - If `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c, i)` where `c` is the element at index `i` in `path_ba`.
   - If `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples of the form `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` where `c1` is `c2 - 1` and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, and `i` ranges from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of 2.

4. **Formulating the Output:**
   - Each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops` will be formatted as `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.
   - Since `c` is an element from `path_ba`, and `i` is the index, the output will consist of strings where the first part is `c + 1` and the second part is `i`.

Given this analysis, the output will be a series of lines, each containing two parts separated by a space, where the first part is the element from `path_ba` incremented by 1, and the second part is the index `i`.

Output: **what is printed**

To make it more precise, we need to know the actual values of `path_ba` and the indices `i`. However, without the specific values, we can describe the general form of the output:

Output: **[(c + 1) i for each (c, i) in ops]**
