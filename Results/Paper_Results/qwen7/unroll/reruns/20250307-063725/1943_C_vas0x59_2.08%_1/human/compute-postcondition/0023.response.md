Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`, `ops` is a list containing tuples (c1, i) and (c2, i) for each iteration of the loop where i ranges from 1 to len(path_ba) - c1 with a step of 2, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
