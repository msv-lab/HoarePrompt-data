Postcondition: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`, and `ops` is a list containing:
- If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `(c, i)` for each `i` in range(`ci + 1`), where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c` is the element at index `ci` in the list `path_ba`.
- If the length of `path_ba` is even, tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for each iteration where `i` ranges from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of 2, where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
