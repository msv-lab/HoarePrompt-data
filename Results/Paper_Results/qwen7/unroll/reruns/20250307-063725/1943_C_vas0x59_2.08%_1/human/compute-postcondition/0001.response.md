Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is an empty list, and (u, v) are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of length `n`, where each element is an empty list. This means that the structure of `u2vs` has been updated, but the values of `n` and the constraints on `u` and `v` remain unchanged.
