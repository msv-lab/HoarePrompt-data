Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `c1` the value of `c2 - 1`. Since `c2` is defined as "half the length of `path_ba`", `c1` becomes "half the length of `path_ba` minus 1". All other variables remain unchanged.
