Functionality: ** The function processes an undirected tree represented by an integer `n` and a list `u2vs` of length `n`. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find the shortest paths from a starting node (0) to all other nodes. Based on the length of the resulting shortest path, it constructs a list `ops` containing specific tuples. Finally, it prints the length of `ops` and the elements of `ops` in a formatted manner, then returns `None`. **
