Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10³, and a list `u2vs` of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree. Additionally, it accepts two integers `u` and `v` such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v. The function does not return any value.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `n` within the specified range, a list `u2vs` which represents the adjacency lists of a tree, and two distinct vertices `u` and `v` within the tree. It processes these inputs but does not produce any output.
