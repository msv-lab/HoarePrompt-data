#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3, u2vs is a list of length n where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and (u, v) are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to append nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node (node 0), following the `previous` array. Each iteration of the loop appends the previous node to `path_ba` until it finds a node with `-1` in the `previous` array, which indicates the start of the path. The final `path_ba` will be the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.

    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an undirected tree represented by an integer `n` and a list `u2vs` of length `n`. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find the shortest paths from a starting node (0) to all other nodes. Based on the length of the resulting shortest path, it constructs a list `ops` containing specific tuples. Finally, it prints the length of `ops` and the elements of `ops` in a formatted manner, then returns `None`.
