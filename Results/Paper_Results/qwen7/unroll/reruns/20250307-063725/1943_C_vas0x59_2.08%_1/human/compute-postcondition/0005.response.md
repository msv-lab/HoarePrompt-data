Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing exactly two elements representing the indices of nodes connected to the node at that index by an edge in a graph, `d` is the distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the BFS (Breadth-First Search) function starting from node 0. The BFS function returns two values: the distance array `d` and another value which is ignored (denoted by `_`). The distance array `d` contains the shortest distance from the starting node (node 0) to all other nodes in the graph. The other variables remain unchanged.
