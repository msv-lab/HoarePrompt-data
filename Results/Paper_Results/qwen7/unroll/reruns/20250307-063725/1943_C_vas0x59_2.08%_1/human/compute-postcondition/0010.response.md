The only variable in the loop head is the boolean condition `True`, which always evaluates to `True`. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the value of `b`**
