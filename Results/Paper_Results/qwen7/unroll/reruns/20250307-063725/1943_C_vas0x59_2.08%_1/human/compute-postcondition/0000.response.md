Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree, and (u, v) are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The other variables `u2vs` and the tuple `(u, v)` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^3 is preserved, and the structure of `u2vs` remains as a list of lists representing the neighbors of vertices in a tree. The values of `u` and `v` are still constrained by 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v, but their specific values are not known and thus not updated.
