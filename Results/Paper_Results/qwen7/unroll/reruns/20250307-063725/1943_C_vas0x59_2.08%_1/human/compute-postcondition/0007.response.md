Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.**

Explanation: The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` calls the `bfs` function with `a` as the argument. The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search to find the shortest paths from the starting node (node 0) to all other nodes in the graph. It returns two values: `d`, which is the updated distance array from the starting node to all other nodes, and `previous`, which is an array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node to each node. The values of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged.
