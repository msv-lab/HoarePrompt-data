Output State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing exactly two elements representing the indices of nodes connected to the node at that index by an edge in a graph. The graph is undirected, meaning if there is an edge from node `u` to node `v`, there is also an edge from node `v` to node `u`.
