Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`, `ops` is an empty list, `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the list `path_ba` and divides it by 2 to assign the result to `c2`. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half the length of `path_ba`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
