Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the previous node (`n`) to the `path_ba` list until it reaches the starting node (node 0), at which point `n == -1` and the loop breaks. This means `path_ba` will contain the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
