Output State: `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`.

Explanation: The loop continues to append nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches the starting node (node 0), following the `previous` array. Each iteration of the loop appends the previous node to `path_ba` until it finds a node with `-1` in the `previous` array, which indicates the start of the path. The final `path_ba` will be the shortest path from node `b` back to node `a`. The values of `a`, `b`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
