Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the updated distance array from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph, `previous` is the array indicating the previous node in the shortest path from the starting node 0 to all other nodes in the graph.**

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The values of `a`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged from their initial states.
