Functionality: **The function accepts a list of parameters including a positive integer t, for each test case, an integer n, and a list a of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. Additionally, it accepts an integer m, and for each query, two distinct integers x_i and y_i. The function processes each test case and query to determine the relationship between the elements at indices x_i and y_i in the list a and returns a result based on these relationships.**

This means the function takes multiple test cases, each with a list of numbers in increasing order, and for each query within those test cases, it checks the relationship between two specified elements in the list and returns the result accordingly.
