Output State: **`t` is reduced to the first value in the input split by spaces, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code `t, = r()` assigns the first value from the input split by spaces to `t`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `m`, and `r`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
