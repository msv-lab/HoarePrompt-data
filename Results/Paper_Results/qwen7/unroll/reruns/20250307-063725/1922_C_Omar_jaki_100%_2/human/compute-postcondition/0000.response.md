Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that takes input split by spaces and maps it to integers. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `m`. It only updates the definition of `r`.
