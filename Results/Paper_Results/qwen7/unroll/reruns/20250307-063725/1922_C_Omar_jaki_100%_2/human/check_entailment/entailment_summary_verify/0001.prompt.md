You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

- Program:
def func():
    r = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = r()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        r()
        a = (-1000000000.0, *r(), 2000000000.0)
        b = [0, 0]
        for (w, x, y, z) in zip(a, a[1:], a[2:], a[3:]):
            v = y - x
            b += (b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y))
        (u,) = r()
        while u:
            u -= 1
            (c, d) = r()
            if c < d:
                print(b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2])
            else:
                print(b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. For each test case, it handles a number of queries, where each query specifies two indices. Based on these indices, the function calculates and prints the difference in values derived from a cumulative sum list `b`. The final output consists of a series of printed differences, reflecting the incremental changes in the sequence defined by the operations on the input list `a` and the updates to `b`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between cities on a number line, where the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The closest city to any given city `i` is unique.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.
   - To travel directly between two cities, the cost is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It constructs an array `a` with sentinel values at the start and end to handle edge cases.
   - It calculates the distances and cumulative costs to reach the closest city for each position.
   - It then processes the queries using the precomputed cumulative costs.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The sentinel values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` ensure that the logic handles the boundary conditions correctly.
   - The loop iterates through the positions and calculates the cost to reach the closest city using the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The cumulative costs are stored in the list `b`, which is used to quickly compute the cost for any range of positions.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses the precomputed cumulative costs to find the minimum cost to travel between the specified cities.
   - The logic correctly handles both cases where the starting city is before or after the destination city.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly by using the sentinel values and ensuring that the cumulative costs are computed properly.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
