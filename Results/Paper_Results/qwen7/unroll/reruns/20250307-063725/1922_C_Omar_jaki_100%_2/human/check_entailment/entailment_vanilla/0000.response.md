### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the minimum cost to travel between cities on a number line, where the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of traveling directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The closest city to any given city `i` is unique.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.
   - To travel directly between two cities, the cost is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function reads the input and processes each test case.
   - It constructs an array `a` with sentinel values at the start and end to handle edge cases.
   - It calculates the distances and cumulative costs to reach the closest city for each position.
   - It then processes the queries using the precomputed cumulative costs.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - The sentinel values `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` ensure that the logic handles the boundary conditions correctly.
   - The loop iterates through the positions and calculates the cost to reach the closest city using the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The cumulative costs are stored in the list `b`, which is used to quickly compute the cost for any range of positions.

5. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, the program uses the precomputed cumulative costs to find the minimum cost to travel between the specified cities.
   - The logic correctly handles both cases where the starting city is before or after the destination city.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly by using the sentinel values and ensuring that the cumulative costs are computed properly.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It handles all the constraints and edge cases appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
