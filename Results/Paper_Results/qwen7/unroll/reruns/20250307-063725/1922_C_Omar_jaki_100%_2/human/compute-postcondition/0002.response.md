The loop condition is `t`. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be truthy (non-zero). Given the initial state where `t` is reduced to the first value in the input split by spaces, `t` must be non-zero for the loop to execute.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**: `t` is reduced to the first value in the input split by spaces.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is non-zero.
3. **Adjustment Needed**: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head, we need to ensure that `t` is non-zero for the loop to execute.

Given the constraints and the initial state, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `t` is non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be non-zero**, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and `r` is a lambda function that maps integers from input split by spaces.
