Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities is flawed. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins using a precomputed array `b`, but the logic for computing `b` is incorrect. The values in `b` do not represent the cumulative minimum cost to reach the closest city for each index.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program uses a lambda function to read input and processes the queries, but the logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities is not implemented correctly. The program seems to attempt to use a sliding window approach to compute the cost, but it does not correctly handle the unique closest city property.

To illustrate the issue, consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(5, 1)`.

The correct minimum costs should be:
- From city 1 to city 4: 3 coins (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4).
- From city 1 to city 5: 8 coins (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5).
- From city 3 to city 4: 1 coin (3 -> 4).
- From city 3 to city 2: 4 coins (3 -> 2).
- From city 5 to city 1: 14 coins (5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1).

However, the provided program does not produce these results. Instead, it uses a complex and incorrect computation method that does not accurately reflect the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
