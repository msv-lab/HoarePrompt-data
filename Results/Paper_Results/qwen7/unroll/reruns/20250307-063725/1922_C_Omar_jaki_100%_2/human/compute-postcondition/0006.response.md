Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a list of non-negative integers in strictly increasing order. For each test case, it handles a number of queries, where each query specifies two indices. Based on these indices, the function calculates and prints the difference in values derived from a cumulative sum list `b`. The final output consists of a series of printed differences, reflecting the incremental changes in the sequence defined by the operations on the input list `a` and the updates to `b`.**
