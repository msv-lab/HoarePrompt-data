You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of differences calculated based on the values generated by the lambda function `r()` and the list `a`.
    #
    #Explanation:
    #- The loop starts with `t` being decremented until it reaches 0, meaning the loop body will execute once for each initial value of `t`.
    #- Inside the loop, `r()` is called, which presumably returns some values used to update the list `a`.
    #- A new list `b` is initialized with `[0, 0]`.
    #- For each set of four consecutive elements `(w, x, y, z)` from the updated list `a`, a calculation is performed to update `b`. Specifically, `b` is updated using the formula `b += b[-2] + v ** (v > x - w), b[-1] + v ** (v > z - y)`, where `v = y - x`.
    #- After updating `b`, another loop is executed, which calls `r()` again to get two values `c` and `d`. If `c < d`, it prints `b[(d - 1) * 2] - b[(c - 1) * 2]`; otherwise, it prints `b[c * 2 - 1] - b[d * 2 - 1]`.
    #
    #The final output state will be a series of printed values, each representing the difference calculated based on the values of `c` and `d` compared to the cumulative sums stored in `b`. The exact values depend on the specific outputs of `r()`, but generally, these differences will reflect the incremental changes in the sequence defined by the operations on `a` and the updates to `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities is flawed. Let's analyze the issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Closest Cities**: The program attempts to calculate the minimum number of coins using a precomputed array `b`, but the logic for computing `b` is incorrect. The values in `b` do not represent the cumulative minimum cost to reach the closest city for each index.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Queries**: The program uses a lambda function to read input and processes the queries, but the logic for determining the minimum cost to travel between two cities is not implemented correctly. The program seems to attempt to use a sliding window approach to compute the cost, but it does not correctly handle the unique closest city property.

To illustrate the issue, consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- Cities are located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`.
- Queries are `(1, 4)`, `(1, 5)`, `(3, 4)`, `(3, 2)`, and `(5, 1)`.

The correct minimum costs should be:
- From city 1 to city 4: 3 coins (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4).
- From city 1 to city 5: 8 coins (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5).
- From city 3 to city 4: 1 coin (3 -> 4).
- From city 3 to city 2: 4 coins (3 -> 2).
- From city 5 to city 1: 14 coins (5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1).

However, the provided program does not produce these results. Instead, it uses a complex and incorrect computation method that does not accurately reflect the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
