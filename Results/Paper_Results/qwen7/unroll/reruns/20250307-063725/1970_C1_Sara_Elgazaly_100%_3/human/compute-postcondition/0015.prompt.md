Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `two` is `True`, `tmp` is `z`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `lst`, `rev`, and `one` remain in their initial states.
Code of the loop:
while rev[tmp] != []:
    two = not two
    tmp = rev[tmp].pop()



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
