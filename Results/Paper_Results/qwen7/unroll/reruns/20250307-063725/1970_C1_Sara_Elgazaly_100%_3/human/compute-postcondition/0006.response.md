Output State: **x is an integer decreased by 1, y is an integer, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, lst is a defaultdict where the key is an integer and the value is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to the key node, rev is a defaultdict where the key is an integer and the value is a list of integers representing the reverse connections, z is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `z = int(input())` assigns the value of the input from the user to the variable `z`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `z` is specifically the integer input received from the user.
