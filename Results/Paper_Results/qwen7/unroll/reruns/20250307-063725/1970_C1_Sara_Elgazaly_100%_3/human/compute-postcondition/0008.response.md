Output State: **`tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` is an integer decreased by 1, `y` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `lst` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer and the value is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to the key node, `rev` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer and the value is a list of integers representing the reverse connections, `z` is an input integer, `one` is True.**

The variable `one` is assigned the boolean value `True`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the initial values of all other variables remain unchanged, and `one` now holds the value `True`.
