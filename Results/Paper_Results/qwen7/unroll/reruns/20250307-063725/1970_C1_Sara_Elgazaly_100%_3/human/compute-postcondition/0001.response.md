Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `lst` is a defaultdict with default value as list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `lst` can be used to store lists of items without needing to explicitly create them beforehand. The values of `x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial states.
