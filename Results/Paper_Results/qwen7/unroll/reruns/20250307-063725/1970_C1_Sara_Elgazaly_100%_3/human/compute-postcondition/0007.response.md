Output State: **`tmp` is equal to `z`, `x` is an integer decreased by 1, `y` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `lst` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer and the value is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to the key node, `rev` is a defaultdict where the key is an integer and the value is a list of integers representing the reverse connections, `z` is an input integer.**

In this case, the variable `tmp` is assigned the value of `z`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
