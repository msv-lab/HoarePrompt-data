Output State: **`x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `lst` is a defaultdict with default value as list, `rev` is a defaultdict with default value as list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new defaultdict named `rev` with a default value of list. This does not affect the values of the existing variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and `lst`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
