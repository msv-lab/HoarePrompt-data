Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings), `answers` is a list of strings, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. After the loop executes, `trumps` contains all the ranks of cards that match the trump suit, `answers` contains formatted strings representing valid moves based on the rules given, and `suits` is updated to reflect the highest rank for each suit that was not a trump or did not already have a higher rank assigned.
