Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input structure and constraints as specified in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1()` processes each test case appropriately:
   - It reads the number of rounds `n`, the trump suit, and the list of 2n cards.
   - It initializes necessary variables and dictionaries to keep track of the cards.
   - It correctly identifies and pairs cards based on the rules provided:
     - Cards of the trump suit can beat any non-trump card.
     - Cards within the same suit are compared based on their ranks.
     - If a card cannot be paired according to the rules, the program correctly outputs "IMPOSSIBLE".
3. The logic for handling the trump cards and non-trump cards is sound and follows the rules specified in the problem.
4. The program ensures that all possible pairs are identified and printed, or correctly identifies when a solution is impossible.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
