Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `trumps` is a sorted list of the original trumps, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a sorted list of the original trumps, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where each pair of ranks from the `trumps` list is appended to the `answers` list in the order they appear, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit.
Code of the loop:
while trumps != []:
    print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
