Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the input format and the number of test cases.
2. It properly identifies the trump suit and processes the cards accordingly.
3. The logic for matching cards follows the rules provided:
   - Cards with the same suit are matched based on rank.
   - Trump cards can beat any non-trump card, regardless of rank.
4. The program attempts to match all cards, and if it cannot find a valid pair for some cards, it correctly outputs "IMPOSSIBLE".
5. The sorting and pairing of remaining trump cards is handled correctly.
6. The overall structure of the program aligns with the problem statement and the expected output format.

Given these points, the program appears to be correct based on the provided execution summary and problem description.

Correctness: **True**
