Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and a list of 2n unique cards. It determines pairs of cards based on the trump suit and the suits of the cards. If possible, it prints valid pairs of cards and their corresponding trump suit. If there are any remaining cards without a suitable pair, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.**
