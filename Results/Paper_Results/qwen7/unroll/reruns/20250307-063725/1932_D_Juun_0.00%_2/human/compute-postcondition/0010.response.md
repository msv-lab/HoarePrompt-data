Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where each pair of ranks from the `trumps` list is appended to the `answers` list in the order they appear, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit. If there are more ranks than suits, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return early.
