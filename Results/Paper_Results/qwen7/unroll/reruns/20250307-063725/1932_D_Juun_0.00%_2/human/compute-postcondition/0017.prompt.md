You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character being the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').
def func_1():
    input()
    trump = input()
    trumps = []
    answers = []
    suits = {'C': None, 'D': None, 'H': None, 'S': None}
    for card in input().split():
        rank, suit = card
        
        if suit == trump:
            trumps.append(rank)
        elif suits[suit] is not None:
            answers.append(' '.join([(x + suit) for x in sorted([suits[suit], rank])]))
            suits[suit] = None
        else:
            suits[suit] = rank
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings) that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where `rank1` and `rank2` are ranks of cards in the same suit that were previously unassigned, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to `None` or ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit.
    for (suit, rank) in suits.items():
        if rank is None:
            continue
        
        if trumps != []:
            answers.append(f'{rank}{suit} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        else:
            print('IMPOSSIBLE')
            return
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where each pair of ranks from the `trumps` list is appended to the `answers` list in the order they appear, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit. If there are more ranks than suits, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return early.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The loop will print out pairs of cards from the `trumps` list, each pair consisting of two cards from the end of the list, separated by the user-inputted `trump` suit. After each pair, the `trumps` list will be empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: The loop will print out each element in the `answers` list on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a predefined structure. It accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and a trump suit which is one of "CDHS". Additionally, it takes a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character being the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S'). Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific output related to the processing of the cards and the trump suit.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
