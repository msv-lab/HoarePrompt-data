#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character being the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').
def func_1():

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings) that match the trump suit, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where `rank1` and `rank2` are ranks of cards in the same suit that were previously unassigned, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to `None` or ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit.

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is an empty list, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where each pair of ranks from the `trumps` list is appended to the `answers` list in the order they appear, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit. If there are more ranks than suits, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE' and return early.
    trumps = sorted(trumps)
    while trumps != []:
        print(f'{trumps.pop()}{trump} {trumps.pop()}{trump}')
        
    #State: The loop will print out pairs of cards from the `trumps` list, each pair consisting of two cards from the end of the list, separated by the user-inputted `trump` suit. After each pair, the `trumps` list will be empty.
    for answer in answers:
        print(answer)
        
    #State: The loop will print out each element in the `answers` list on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a trump suit, and a list of 2n unique cards. It determines pairs of cards based on the trump suit and the suits of the cards. If possible, it prints valid pairs of cards and their corresponding trump suit. If there are any remaining cards without a suitable pair, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
