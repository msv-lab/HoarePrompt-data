Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is a string input by the user, `trumps` is a list of ranks (strings) that match the trump suit and has been modified based on the loop, `answers` is a list of strings formatted as 'rank1suit rank2suit', where `rank1` and `rank2` are ranks of cards in the same suit that were previously unassigned, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values set to either `None` or ranks (strings) of cards that were assigned to each suit. The loop iterates over each suit in `suits`. If the value of the suit is not `None`, it checks if there are any remaining trumps in the `trumps` list. If there are, it appends a new string to `answers` in the format 'rank1suit rank2suit' using the current rank and suit, and removes the trump from the `trumps` list. If there are no trumps left, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE' and returns immediately. After the loop finishes, if there are still suits with `None` values in `suits` and no trumps left in `trumps`, the loop will print 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
