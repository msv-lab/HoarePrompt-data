t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character being the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').
