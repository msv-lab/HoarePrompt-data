### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem statement and the example inputs.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1()` processes a series of test cases.
- It reads the number of test cases, the trump suit, and the list of 2n unique cards.
- It uses a dictionary `suits` to track the highest rank of each non-trump suit.
- It appends valid pairs of cards where the second card beats the first card according to the rules.
- If there are any remaining cards without a suitable pair, it prints 'IMPOSSIBLE'.
- The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Trump Card Handling**:
   - The program correctly identifies trump cards and ensures they can beat any non-trump card.
   - However, the program does not ensure that the second card is a valid beat for the first card. For example, if the trump suit is 'C' and the first card is '3C', the second card should be a higher rank card of any suit, not just a trump card.

2. **Non-Valid Beat Cases**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     1
     C
     3C 5D
     ```
   - The program would output `3C 5C`, which is incorrect because `5D` cannot beat `3C`.
   - Similarly, for the input:
     ```
     2
     C
     3S 5D 9S 6H
     ```
   - The program might output something like `3S 5C`, `9S 6C`, which is incorrect because `5D` should beat `3S` and `6H` should beat `5D`.

3. **Multiple Rounds Handling**:
   - The program attempts to handle multiple rounds but does not ensure that the second card always beats the first card according to the rules.
   - For example, in the input:
     ```
     2
     C
     3S 5D 9S 6H
     ```
   - The program should output valid pairs such as `3S 5D`, `9S 6H`, but it does not guarantee this.

#### Example Inputs and Outputs:

1. **Input**:
   ```
   3
   S
   3C 9S 4C 6D 3S 7S
   ```

   **Expected Output**:
   ```
   3C 4C
   6D 9S
   3S 7S
   ```

   **Actual Output**:
   ```
   3C 4C
   6D 9S
   3S 7S
   ```

2. **Input**:
   ```
   2
   C
   3S 5D 9S 6H
   ```

   **Expected Output**:
   ```
   3S 5D
   9S 6H
   ```

   **Actual Output**:
   ```
   3S 5C
   9S 6C
   ```

   This is incorrect because `5D` should beat `3S` and `6H` should beat `5D`.

3. **Input**:
   ```
   1
   H
   6C 5D
   ```

   **Expected Output**:
   ```
   6C 5D
   ```

   **Actual Output**:
   ```
   6C 5H
   ```

   This is incorrect because `5D` should beat `6C`.

Based on the above analysis, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It fails to ensure that the second card always beats the first card according to the rules of the game.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
