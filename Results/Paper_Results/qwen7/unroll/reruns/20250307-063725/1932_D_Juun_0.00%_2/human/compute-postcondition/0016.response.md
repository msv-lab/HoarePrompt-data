Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a predefined structure. It accepts an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and a trump suit which is one of "CDHS". Additionally, it takes a list of 2n unique cards, where each card is represented by a two-character string with the first character being the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character being the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S'). Based on these inputs, the function returns a specific output related to the processing of the cards and the trump suit.**
