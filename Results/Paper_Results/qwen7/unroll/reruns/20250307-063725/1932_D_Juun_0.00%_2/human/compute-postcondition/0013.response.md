Output State: **The loop will print out pairs of cards from the `trumps` list, each pair consisting of two cards from the end of the list, separated by the user-inputted `trump` suit. After each pair, the `trumps` list will be empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues to run as long as there are elements in the `trumps` list. In each iteration, it pops two elements from the end of the list and prints them with the `trump` suit in between. This process continues until the `trumps` list is empty. Since the `trumps` list is initially sorted and gets modified by popping elements, eventually, it will be exhausted, and the loop will terminate.
