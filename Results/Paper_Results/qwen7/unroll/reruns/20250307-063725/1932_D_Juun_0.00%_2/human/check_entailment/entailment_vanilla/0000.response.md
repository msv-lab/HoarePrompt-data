Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes variables and reads the necessary inputs for each test case.
2. **Trick Processing**: 
   - It processes the cards in the input string, separating the rank and suit.
   - It identifies trump cards and non-trump cards.
   - It ensures that non-trump cards are matched with the highest available non-trump card of the same suit.
   - It handles trump cards appropriately, ensuring they are matched with the highest available non-trump card of the same suit when possible.
3. **Handling Remaining Trump Cards**: 
   - After processing all non-trump cards, it attempts to pair remaining trump cards if there are any unmatched non-trump cards left.
   - If there are no suitable matches for the remaining trump cards, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".
4. **Output**: 
   - The program outputs the pairs of cards in the required format.
   - If a valid sequence cannot be reconstructed, it prints "IMPOSSIBLE".

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to handle all edge cases and produce the correct output according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
