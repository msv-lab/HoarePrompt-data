Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop.
- `subseq_lens` is a list of all \(i-1\) values found during the loop executions.
- `ansv` is a list containing all elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end.

To determine what will be printed by `print(len(ansv))`, we need to understand the composition of `ansv`.

1. `subseq_lens` contains all \(i-1\) values found during the loop executions.
2. `ansv` is constructed by taking all elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end. This means `ansv` contains all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one.

Therefore, the length of `ansv` is one less than the length of `subseq_lens`.

Let's denote the length of `subseq_lens` as \(n\). Then, the length of `ansv` would be \(n - 1\).

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the length of subseq_lens)**
