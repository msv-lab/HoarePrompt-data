The function processes an input integer \(x\) and calculates a sequence based on the binary representation of \(x\). It then prints the length of this sequence followed by its elements. If the input \(x\) is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0 and returns. Otherwise, it finds the maximum length of the binary prefix that can be subtracted from \(x\) repeatedly, constructs a sequence based on these lengths, and prints the sequence along with its length. The function does not return any value.
