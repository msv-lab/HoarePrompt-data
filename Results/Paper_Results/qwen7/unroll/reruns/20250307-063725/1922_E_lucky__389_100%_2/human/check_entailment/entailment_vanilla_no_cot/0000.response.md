Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, the logic for constructing the array based on the number of required increasing subsequences is flawed. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `x`**: The program attempts to construct an array based on the binary representation of `x`, which is a good approach in theory. However, the implementation does not correctly handle the construction of the array to ensure that it meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction Logic**: The program constructs the array by appending values based on the binary representation of `x`. This approach assumes that the constructed array will have the exact number of increasing subsequences, which is not guaranteed. For instance, the program might produce arrays that do not meet the exact count of `X` increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `x` is a power of 2, or when the constructed array does not yield the exact number of increasing subsequences.

To correctly solve this problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed. One possible solution involves using combinatorial methods to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

MOD = 1000000007

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        if x == 1:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if x == 2:
            print(1)
            print(0)
            continue
        
        # Find the largest k such that C(n, k) = x
        n = 1
        while True:
            ways = math.comb(n, n // 2)
            if ways >= x:
                break
            n += 1
        
        # Adjust n if necessary
        while ways > x:
            n -= 1
            ways = math.comb(n, n // 2)
        
        # Construct the array
        arr = [0] * n
        for i in range(n // 2 + 1, n):
            arr[i] = 1
        
        # Ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences
        while ways > x:
            for i in range(n // 2, -1, -1):
                if arr[i] == 0:
                    arr[i] = 1
                    ways -= math.comb(n - i - 1, n // 2 - i)
                    break
        
        print(n)
        print(' '.join(map(str, arr)))
```

This corrected version uses combinatorial methods to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
