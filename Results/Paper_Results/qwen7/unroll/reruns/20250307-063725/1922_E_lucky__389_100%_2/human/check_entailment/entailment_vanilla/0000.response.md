### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a binary representation approach to construct the array.

2. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - For `X = 2`, the simplest solution is `[0]` since it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence containing just `0`.
   - For other values of `X`, the solution breaks down `X` into its binary representation. Each bit position represents a part of the array where the subsequence count increases.
   - Specifically, if `X` can be represented as the sum of powers of 2, the corresponding positions in the array will have unique values to ensure the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the base case when `X = 2` by printing `[0]`.
   - It then iterates to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `X` and constructs the `subseq_lens` list, which stores the lengths of the segments needed.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed based on these segment lengths.
   - Finally, the array is printed with the correct length and values.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing `[0]`.
   - For other values, the binary representation ensures the construction of the array with the required number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output format matches the problem requirements: the length of the array followed by the array elements.
   - The logic ensures that the array has the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by `X`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the solution for finding an array with a specified number of increasing subsequences. It handles all edge cases and produces the correct output format.

**Correctness: True**
