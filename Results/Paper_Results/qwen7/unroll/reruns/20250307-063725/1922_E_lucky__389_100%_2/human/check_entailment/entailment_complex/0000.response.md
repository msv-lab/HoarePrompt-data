Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1()` for each one. This part is correct.

2. **Base Case Handling**: For the base case where `x == 2`, the program correctly outputs `1` and `0` and returns. This handles the simplest non-trivial case correctly.

3. **Binary Representation and Subsequence Length Calculation**: 
   - The program uses a loop to find the binary representation of `x` and calculates the lengths of the increasing subsequences needed. Specifically, it finds the highest power of 2 that fits into `x` repeatedly until `x` becomes zero. This is done correctly using the inner `while` loop.
   - The lengths of these subsequences are stored in `subseq_lens`. This part is also correct.

4. **Constructing the Result Array**:
   - The program constructs the result array `ansv` by creating a sequence of zeros up to the maximum length found (`mx`) and then appending the remaining lengths from `subseq_lens`.
   - The length of the resulting array is printed first, followed by the elements of `ansv`.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of the array followed by the elements of the array, which matches the required output format.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when `x` is 2 by printing `1` and `0`.
   - For other values of `x`, the program constructs the array and prints it in the correct format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences, and it handles all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
