You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.
def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if (x == 2) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `mx` is 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer, `subseq_lens` is an empty list, and `x` is not equal to 2
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
        
    #State: mx is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop, and subseq_lens is a list of all \(i-1\) values found during the loop executions.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop, `subseq_lens` is a list of all \(i-1\) values found during the loop executions, `ansv` is a list containing all elements from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: n - 1 (where n is the length of subseq_lens)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The output state remains unchanged because the loop does not modify any variables. The loop only prints the elements of `ansv` starting from index 1 to the end, but it does not change the values of `mx`, `subseq_lens`, or `ansv`.
    print()
    #This is printed: Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
