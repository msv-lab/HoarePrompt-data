Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the object `subseq_lens`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range is `range(1, len(subseq_lens))`).

3. **Determine the State of `subseq_lens`**: For the loop to execute, `subseq_lens` must have at least one element because the loop starts from `i = 1`, which means `len(subseq_lens)` must be at least 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `i` must be 1 initially.
   - `subseq_lens` must have at least one element.

5. **Consider the Other Variables**:
   - `mx`: This variable is updated during the loop based on the values in `subseq_lens`. Since the loop hasn't started yet, `mx` can be any value, but it doesn't affect the loop's execution condition.
   - `ansv`: This list is not directly involved in the loop's execution condition.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `subseq_lens`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `subseq_lens` must have at least one element**
