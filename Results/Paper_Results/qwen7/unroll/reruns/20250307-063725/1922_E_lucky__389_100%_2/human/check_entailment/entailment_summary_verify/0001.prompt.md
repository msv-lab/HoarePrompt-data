You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

def func_1():
    x = int(input())
    subseq_lens = []
    mx = 0
    if x == 2:
        print(1)
        print(0)
        return
    while x != 0:
        i = 0
        while 2 ** i <= x:
            i += 1
        if i == 0:
            break
        else:
            subseq_lens.append(i - 1)
            x -= 2 ** (i - 1)
            mx = max(mx, i - 1)
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
    print(len(ansv))
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
    print()



- Function Summary: 
The function processes an input integer \(x\) and calculates a sequence based on the binary representation of \(x\). It then prints the length of this sequence followed by its elements. If the input \(x\) is 2, it directly prints 1 and 0 and returns. Otherwise, it finds the maximum length of the binary prefix that can be subtracted from \(x\) repeatedly, constructs a sequence based on these lengths, and prints the sequence along with its length. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
2. The given solution attempts to generate such an array by breaking down the target number of increasing subsequences (`x`) into powers of 2.
3. For `x = 2`, the solution correctly prints `[0]` which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).
4. For other values of `x`, the solution constructs the array by using the binary representation of `x`. Each bit position corresponds to an element in the array, ensuring the correct number of increasing subsequences.
5. The logic for constructing the array seems sound, as it ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `x`.
6. However, there is a critical issue in the implementation:
   - The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, but it expects `x` to be passed from the main loop.
   - This leads to an error because `func_1()` tries to read from `stdin` without being properly initialized.
7. To fix this, the function `func_1()` should be modified to accept `x` as a parameter, or the main loop should pass the value of `x` directly to `func_1()`.

Given these points, the current implementation is incorrect due to the function call issue.
