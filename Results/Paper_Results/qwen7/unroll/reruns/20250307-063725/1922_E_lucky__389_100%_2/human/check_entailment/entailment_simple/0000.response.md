Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and initializes the necessary variables. However, the function `func_1()` is called without parameters, which is incorrect since `x` should be passed as an argument.

2. **Handling the Case When `x` is 2**: The program correctly handles the case when `x` is 2 by printing `1` and `0`. This is correct because an array `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.

3. **Finding Subsequence Lengths**: The program uses a binary representation approach to find the subsequence lengths. For each bit position where `2^(i-1)` fits into `x`, it adds `i-1` to `subseq_lens` and subtracts `2^(i-1)` from `x`. This is a correct approach to decompose `x` into its binary representation, which corresponds to the lengths of the subsequence segments.

4. **Constructing the Array**: The program constructs the array `ansv` by first filling it with a range of numbers up to `mx` and then appending the remaining subsequence lengths. This ensures that the array has the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by `x`.

5. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the length of the array followed by the array elements. The logic for constructing the array and the output format are correct.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
