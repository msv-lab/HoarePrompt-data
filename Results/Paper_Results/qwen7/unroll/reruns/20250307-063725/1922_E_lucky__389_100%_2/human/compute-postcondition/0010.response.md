Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value of \(i-1\) found during the loop, `subseq_lens` is a list of all \(i-1\) values found during the loop executions, `ansv` is a list containing integers from 0 to `mx-1`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `ansv` using a list comprehension that includes all integers from 0 up to `mx-1`. The values of `mx` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged from their initial state.
