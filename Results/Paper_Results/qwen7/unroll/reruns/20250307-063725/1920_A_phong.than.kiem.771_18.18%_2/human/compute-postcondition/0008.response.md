Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over the list `num`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over the list `num`, the first value of `i` should be the first element in the list `num`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `num`**: The list `num` contains all integers `v` where `t` is 3. For the loop to execute, `num` must contain at least one element.

4. **Consider other variables**: The variables `n`, `start`, `end`, and `count_num` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop can execute based on the given information.

Based on this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `num` contains at least one element and `i` is set to the first element of `num`.

**State:**
- `num` must contain at least one element.
- `i` is the first element of `num`.

So, the final state is:
**State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` must contain at least one element, `count_num` is 0, `i` is the first element of `num`**.
