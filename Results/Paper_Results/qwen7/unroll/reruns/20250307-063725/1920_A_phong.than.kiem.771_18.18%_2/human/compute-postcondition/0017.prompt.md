You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = 1000000000.0
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, it returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
