Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1(isOne)`**: This function correctly handles the input based on the boolean `isOne`. However, since the program always calls `func_1(False)`, it will always read an integer input, which is consistent with the problem's requirement to read the number of test cases `t` and the number of constraints `n` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2(space, to_int)`**: This function is not used in the main program logic. It seems to be a general-purpose function for parsing input, but it is not necessary for the solution. The main program directly uses `input()` to read values, so we can ignore this function for correctness checking.

3. **Function `func_3(arr, sym)`**: This function concatenates a list of integers with a separator. While it is not used in the main program, it is a helper function that could be useful in other contexts.

4. **Function `func_4(string, substring)`**: This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string. It is not used in the main program, so it is not relevant for correctness checking.

5. **Function `func_5(arr, element)`**: This function returns the indices of a given element in a list. It is not used in the main program, so it is not relevant for correctness checking.

6. **Function `func_6(arr, index, value)`**: This function searches for a value at a specific index across sublists. It is not used in the main program, so it is not relevant for correctness checking.

7. **Function `func_7()`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It initializes `start` and `end` based on constraints of types 1 and 2, respectively. It then collects all integers from constraints of type 3 into a list `num`. It correctly counts the number of integers in `num` that fall within the range `[start, end]` and adjusts the final count accordingly.

Given that `func_7()` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and the other functions are either not used or do not affect the correctness of the main logic, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
