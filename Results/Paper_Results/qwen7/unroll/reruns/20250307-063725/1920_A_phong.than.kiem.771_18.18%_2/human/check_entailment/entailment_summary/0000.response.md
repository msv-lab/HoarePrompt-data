### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is used to get the number of test cases (`n`). Since the problem specifies that `n` is read from input, this function correctly handles that requirement.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is not used in the main logic but is part of the provided code. It processes input strings and splits them into lists of integers. However, it's not directly relevant to the solution of the problem.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function is not used in the main logic but is part of the provided code. It concatenates integers with a separator. Again, it's not directly relevant to the solution of the problem.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the main logic but is part of the provided code. It finds all indices of a substring within a string. It's not relevant to the problem.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function is not used in the main logic but is part of the provided code. It finds indices of a specific element in a list. It's not relevant to the problem.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function is not used in the main logic but is part of the provided code. It searches for a specific value in a list of lists. It's not relevant to the problem.

7. **Function `func_7`**: This function correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. It correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values (`start` and `end`) from constraints of types 1 and 2, respectively. It also correctly accounts for constraints of type 3 by excluding the specified values from the count of valid integers.

8. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly calls `func_1` to get the number of test cases.
   - It iterates over each test case, calling `func_7` to process the constraints and get the result.
   - It prints the result for each test case.

Given that `func_7` correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints, and the main logic correctly processes each test case using `func_7`, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
