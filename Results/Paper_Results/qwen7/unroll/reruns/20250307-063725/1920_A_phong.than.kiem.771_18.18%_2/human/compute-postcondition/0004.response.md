Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(n):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer because `range(n)` requires `n` to be at least 1.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `n` is initially an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, it is already within the required range.
   - The variable `i` should start at 0 for the loop to begin its first iteration.

Given these points, we need to adjust the initial values of `i` and ensure `n` is valid for the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list**
