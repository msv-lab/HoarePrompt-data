Output State: **`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. All other variables (t, x) retain their initial conditions as specified in the precondition.**

This means that `n` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and must be within the range of 2 to 100. The variables `t` and `x` remain unchanged from their initial conditions, with `t` being an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and `x` being an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
