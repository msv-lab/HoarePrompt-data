### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to determine the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints include:
   - \( k \) must be greater than or equal to some integer \( x \) (type 1).
   - \( k \) must be less than or equal to some integer \( x \) (type 2).
   - \( k \) must be not equal to some integer \( x \) (type 3).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function is used to read an integer from input but is not utilized in the main logic.
   - **func_2**: This function reads a line from input and splits it into elements. It is also not used in the main logic.
   - **func_3**: This function concatenates elements with a separator. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_4**: This function finds indices of a substring in a string. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_5**: This function returns the indices of elements in an array. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_6**: This function searches for a subarray with a specific value at a given index. It is not used in the main logic.
   - **func_7**: This function processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers \( k \).

3. **Main Logic in `func_7`**:
   - **Initialization**: Initializes `start` to -1 and `end` to 1,000,000,000.0.
   - **Reading Constraints**: Iterates over the constraints, updating `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint.
     - For type 1 (greater than or equal to), updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and \( v \).
     - For type 2 (less than or equal to), updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and \( v \).
     - For type 3 (not equal to), adds \( v \) to the list `num`.
   - **Counting Invalid Values**: Counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - **Final Calculation**: Returns the number of valid integers \( k \) as \( end - start + 1 - count_num \). If `start` is greater than `end`, returns 0.

4. **Validation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the range `[start, end]` is valid.
   - The function correctly counts the number of invalid values and subtracts them from the total range length.
   - The function handles edge cases where `start` is greater than `end` by returning 0.
