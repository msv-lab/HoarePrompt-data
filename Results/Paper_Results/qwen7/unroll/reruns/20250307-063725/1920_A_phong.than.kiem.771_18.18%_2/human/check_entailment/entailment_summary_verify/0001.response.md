### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are not used in the main logic of `func_7`. This is consistent with the original assessment, suggesting they are placeholders or remnants from previous development stages. Their presence does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

2. **Main Logic in Function 7**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. These values will be updated based on the constraints.
   - **Reading Constraints**: It reads `n` constraints and processes them:
     - For `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - For `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - For `t == 3`, it adds `v` to the list `num` (which stores the values that `k` should not be).
   - **Counting Valid Integers**: After processing all constraints, it counts how many values in `num` fall outside the range `[start, end]`.
   - **Final Calculation**: It calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid integers from the total possible integers in the range `[start, end]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `start > end` by returning `0`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the number of invalid integers exceeds the range `[start, end]` by returning `0`.

4. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `start` and `end` will always be valid.
   - The problem also guarantees that no two constraints are the same, so the logic should work correctly without duplicates.

5. **Correctness of the Logic**:
   - The logic for updating `start` and `end` is correct. `start` is set to the maximum value from constraints of type 1, and `end` is set to the minimum value from constraints of type 2.
   - The logic for counting the number of invalid integers (`count_num`) is correct. It iterates through the list `num` and increments `count_num` for each value that falls within the range `[start, end]`.
   - The final calculation `(end - start + 1 - count_num)` correctly computes the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid integers from the total possible integers in the range `[start, end]`.

Given the above analysis, the main logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem. The use of helper functions that are not utilized does not affect the correctness of the main logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.
