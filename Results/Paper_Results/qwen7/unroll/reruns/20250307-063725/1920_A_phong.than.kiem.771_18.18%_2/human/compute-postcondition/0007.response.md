Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `count_num = 0` initializes the variable `count_num` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain as described in the initial state.
