Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. The program initializes `start` and `end` variables to represent the valid range of `k` values. It then iterates through the constraints, updating `start` and `end` accordingly and keeping track of the values that `k` must not be (`num`). Finally, it calculates the number of valid `k` values within the range `[start, end]`, excluding the invalid values stored in `num`.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees provided (such as the existence of at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints being the same), the program handles all cases correctly. The logic ensures that the range `[start, end]` is properly adjusted and that invalid values are excluded from the final count. Therefore, the program works as expected for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
