### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1(isOne)`:
This function simply returns either an integer input or 1 based on the boolean `isOne`. This function is not used in the main program logic and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_2(space, to_int)`:
This function reads a line of input and splits it into a list of integers. It is used to read the constraints for each test case. However, this function is not used in the main program logic and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_3(arr, sym)`:
This function concatenates a list of integers with a separator. It is not used in the main program logic and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_4(string, substring)`:
This function finds all occurrences of a substring in a string. It is not used in the main program logic and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_5(arr, element)`:
This function returns the indices of a given element in a list. It is not used in the main program logic and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_6(arr, index, value)`:
This function searches for a specific value in a list of lists. It is not used in the main program logic and seems unnecessary for the problem at hand.

#### Function `func_7()`:
This function correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n` is the number of constraints.
   - `start` is initialized to -1 (indicating no lower bound yet).
   - `end` is initialized to 1000000000.0 (indicating no upper bound yet).
   - `num` is a list to store the values that `k` must not be.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - For each constraint, update `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `t == 1`, update `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - If `t == 2`, update `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - If `t == 3`, add `v` to the list `num`.

3. **Count Valid Integers**:
   - Count the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.
   - Calculate the number of valid integers `k` as `end - start + 1 - count_num`.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `start > end`, return 0 (no valid integers).

The logic in `func_7` correctly handles all the constraints and edge cases. It ensures that the range `[start, end]` is properly adjusted and that invalid values are excluded from the final count.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program reads the number of test cases `n`.
- For each test case, it calls `func_7()` and appends the result to the list `ans`.
- Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the guarantees provided (such as the existence of at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints being the same), the program handles all cases correctly. The logic ensures that the range `[start, end]` is properly adjusted and that invalid values are excluded from the final count. Therefore, the program works as expected for all potential cases described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints.

**Final: True**
