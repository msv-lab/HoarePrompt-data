Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized with inappropriate values. `start` should be set to a very large number (or infinity) and `end` should be set to a very small number (or negative infinity), but the current initialization is not appropriate.

2. **Handling Constraints**: The program does not handle the constraints correctly. For example, when processing the constraints, it should update `start` and `end` appropriately based on the type of constraint (greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, and not equal to). However, the current implementation only updates `start` and `end` for constraints of type 1 and 2, and it does not properly account for the "not equal to" constraints.

3. **Counting Valid Integers**: The logic to count the valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly exclude the values specified in the "not equal to" constraints from the count.

To fix these issues, you need to initialize `start` and `end` correctly, process all constraints appropriately, and ensure that the "not equal to" constraints are handled correctly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_7():
    n = int(input())
    start = float('inf')
    end = float('-inf')
    num_not_equal = []
    
    for _ in range(n):
        t, v = map(int, input().split())
        if t == 1:
            start = min(start, v)
        elif t == 2:
            end = max(end, v)
        elif t == 3:
            num_not_equal.append(v)
    
    # Remove duplicates from num_not_equal
    num_not_equal = list(set(num_not_equal))
    
    valid_count = end - start + 1
    for val in num_not_equal:
        if start <= val <= end:
            valid_count -= 1
    
    if start > end:
        return 0
    return valid_count
```

This corrected version initializes `start` and `end` correctly, processes all constraints, and ensures that the "not equal to" constraints are handled properly.
