### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`). However, these functions do not seem to be used within the main logic of the solution. This suggests they might be placeholders or remnants from previous development stages. Given that none of these functions are called in the main logic, they do not impact the correctness of the program.

2. **Main Logic in Function 7**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. These values will be updated based on the constraints.
   - **Reading Constraints**: It reads `n` constraints and processes them:
     - For `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - For `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - For `t == 3`, it adds `v` to the list `num` (which stores the values that `k` should not be).
   - **Counting Valid Integers**: After processing all constraints, it counts how many values in `num` fall outside the range `[start, end]`.
   - **Final Calculation**: It calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid integers from the total possible integers in the range `[start, end]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `start > end` by returning `0`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the number of invalid integers exceeds the range `[start, end]` by returning `0`.

4. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `start` and `end` will always be valid.
   - The problem also guarantees that no two constraints are the same, so the logic should work correctly without duplicates.

5. **Validation Using Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code provides detailed insights into the state of the program at various points. It confirms that the function `func_7` correctly processes the constraints and calculates the number of valid integers `k` based on the given constraints.
   - The annotated code also confirms that the logic for handling edge cases and counting valid integers is sound.

Given the above analysis and the validation using the annotated code, the original assessment is accurate. The main logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem, and the unused helper functions do not affect the correctness of the program.

### Conclusion:
The main logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem. The use of helper functions that are not utilized does not affect the correctness of the main logic.
