### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The program defines several helper functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`, and `func_7`). However, these functions do not seem to be used within the main logic of the solution. This suggests they might be placeholders or remnants from previous development stages. Since these functions are not used, they do not impact the correctness of the main logic.

2. **Main Logic in Function 7**:
   - **Initialization**: The function initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. These values will be updated based on the constraints.
   - **Reading Constraints**: It reads `n` constraints and processes them:
     - For `t == 1`, it updates `start` to the maximum of `start` and `v`.
     - For `t == 2`, it updates `end` to the minimum of `end` and `v`.
     - For `t == 3`, it adds `v` to the list `num` (which stores the values that `k` should not be).
   - **Counting Valid Integers**: After processing all constraints, it counts how many values in `num` fall outside the range `[start, end]`.
   - **Final Calculation**: It calculates the number of valid integers `k` by subtracting the count of invalid integers from the total possible integers in the range `[start, end]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where `start > end` by returning `0`.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the number of invalid integers exceeds the range `[start, end]` by returning `0`.

4. **Guarantees**:
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `start` and `end` will always be valid.
   - The problem also guarantees that no two constraints are the same, so the logic should work correctly without duplicates.

5. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations provided for `func_7` correctly describe the state transitions and the logic flow. The function correctly updates `start` and `end` based on the constraints and correctly counts the number of valid integers `k`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The main logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem, and the unused helper functions do not affect the correctness of the main logic.

### Conclusion:
The main logic in `func_7` correctly implements the solution to the problem. The use of helper functions that are not utilized does not affect the correctness of the main logic.
