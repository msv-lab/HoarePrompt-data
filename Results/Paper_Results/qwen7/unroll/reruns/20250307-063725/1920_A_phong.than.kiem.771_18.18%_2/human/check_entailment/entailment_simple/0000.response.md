Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the necessary functions to process the input and calculate the number of valid integers `k` that satisfy all constraints.
2. `func_1(isOne)` correctly handles the input of the number of test cases `t`.
3. `func_7()` is designed to process each test case:
   - It reads the number of constraints `n`.
   - It initializes `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` to represent the initial bounds for `k`.
   - It iterates over the constraints, updating `start` and `end` based on the type of constraint (`t`).
   - It collects all values `v` where `t` is `3` (i.e., `k` must not be equal to `v`) in the list `num`.
   - After processing all constraints, it calculates the number of valid `k` values that fall within the range `[start, end]` and are not in `num`.
   - The logic to handle the case where `start` is greater than `end` is correctly implemented, returning `0` in this scenario.
   - The final result is calculated correctly, ensuring that the number of valid `k` values is returned.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation of `func_7()`, the program should correctly compute the number of valid integers `k` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
