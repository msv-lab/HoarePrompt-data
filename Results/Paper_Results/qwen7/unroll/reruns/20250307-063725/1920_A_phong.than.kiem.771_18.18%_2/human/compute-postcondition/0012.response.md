Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`. The condition `start > end` is true.**
