Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

n = func_1()
ans = []
alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
for i in range(n):
    ans.append(func_7())
for i in ans:
    print(i)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return an integer input or always return 1. If isOne is False, the function returns an integer input; if isOne is True, the function always returns 1.
def func_1(isOne):
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1 regardless of the value of isOne.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is `False`, it reads an integer input from the user and returns it. If `isOne` is `True`, it disregards any input and always returns the integer `1`. In both cases, the function ensures that the program ultimately returns the integer `1`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each line within a test case contains two integers separated by a space, where the first integer represents the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3) and the second integer represents the value x for that constraint.
def func_2(space, to_int):
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: Postcondition: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and `items` is a list of integers extracted from the input string `line`. If the condition `space` is true, `items` is derived from splitting `line` into individual strings and converting them to integers. Otherwise, `items` is directly extracted as a list of integers from the input string `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers converted from the elements in the list 'items'
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of integers extracted directly from the input string 'line'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `space` (a string) and `to_int` (a boolean). It processes the input string `space` to extract a list of integers. If `to_int` is True, it converts the elements in the list to integers and returns them. If `to_int` is False, it returns the list of integers extracted directly from the input string `space`. After executing, the function returns a list of integers.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and sym is a string representing a separator (e.g., ' ', ',', etc.).
def func_3(arr, sym):
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: Output State: `string` is a concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by `sym`.
    return string
    #The program returns the concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by `sym`
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates all integers in `arr`, separating them with `sym`, and returns the resulting string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a string, substring is a non-empty string, and substring is guaranteed to appear in string at least once.
def func_4(string, substring):
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: indices is a list containing all the starting indices where substring appears in string.
    return indices
    #The program returns the list 'indices' containing all the starting indices where the substring appears in the string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string and a non-empty substring, and returns a list of integers representing all the starting indices where the substring appears within the string.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and element is an integer present in the list arr.
def func_5(arr, element):
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #A list of indices where the integer 'element' is found in the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element` present in `arr`. It returns a list of indices where `element` is found within `arr`.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist contains at least one integer. index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(sublist) for all sublists in arr. value is an integer.
def func_6(arr, index, value):
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: arr is a list of lists, where each sublist contains at least one integer. index is an integer such that 0 <= index < len(sublist) for all sublists in arr. value is an integer. The loop iterates through each sublist in arr. If the element at the specified index of a sublist equals the given value, the function returns that sublist. If no sublist contains an element equal to the given value, the function returns None.
    return None
    #None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_6` accepts a list of lists `arr`, an integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each sublist in `arr` to find an element at the specified `index` that matches the `value`. If such an element is found, the function returns the entire sublist containing that element. If no matching element is found, the function returns `None`.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and for each constraint, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3} and x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2, and all constraints are unique.

            if start < v:
                start = v

    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`.
    if (start > end) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `start` is the minimum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 1, `end` is the maximum value among all integers `v` where `t` is 2, `num` is a list containing all integers `v` where `t` is 3, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are within the range `[start, end]`, and `start` is less than or equal to `end`
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if end - start + 1 >= count_num else 0
    #The program returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus `count_num`, but only if `end - start + 1` is greater than or equal to `count_num`. Otherwise, it returns 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of constraints involving integers and calculates a specific value based on those constraints. It first determines the minimum value (`start`) for constraints of type 1 and the maximum value (`end`) for constraints of type 2. It also collects all integers from constraints of type 3 into a list (`num`). Afterward, it counts how many numbers in `num` fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the difference between `end` and `start` plus one, minus the count of numbers within the range, provided that the difference is greater than or equal to the count. If not, it returns 0.
