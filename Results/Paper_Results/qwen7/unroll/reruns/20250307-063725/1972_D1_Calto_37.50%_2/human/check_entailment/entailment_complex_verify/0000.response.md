### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Functions Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, as noted, it is not used in the main logic of the program.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to solve a different problem. It calculates the sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. This calculation does not relate to the main problem statement.

3. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - The main logic of the program iterates over all possible values of `i` from 1 to `m-1` and performs the following calculations:
     - `x = n - (i * i - i)`
     - `y = i * i`
     - `cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)`
   - The final result is returned as `cnt` if `cnt` is not zero, otherwise, it returns 1.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs a different computation involving quadratic residues, which is unrelated to the problem.
   - The main program does not use `func_1` to compute the GCD of any pair \((a, b)\) and then check the required condition.
   - Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution to the given problem. The functions and the main logic do not address the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

**Final: False**
