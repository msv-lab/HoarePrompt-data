Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main problem statement, which requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in solving the main problem. The function `func_2` appears to be an attempt to solve a different problem, likely related to counting certain types of quadratic residues, but it does not meet the requirements of the given problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses a different approach that is not relevant to the problem.
