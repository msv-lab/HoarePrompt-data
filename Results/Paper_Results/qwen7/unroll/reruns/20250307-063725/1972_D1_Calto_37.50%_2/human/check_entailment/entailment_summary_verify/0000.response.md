### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and will work as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to calculate a sum involving \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - The logic inside the loop does not seem to relate to the problem at hand. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The summary suggests that `func_2` calculates a sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- If this sum equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.

Given the problem statement and the function summary, it is clear that `func_2` is not solving the intended problem. Instead, it seems to be attempting to solve a different problem related to quadratic residues, which is not relevant here.

However, the original assessment states that the program does not correctly solve the given problem because `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main problem statement. This part of the assessment is accurate. But the original assessment also mentions that `func_2` does not meet the requirements of the given problem, which is true, but it does not fully capture the fact that `func_1` is correctly implemented and could be used to solve the problem if integrated properly.

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy the condition.

Since `func_1` is correctly implemented and could be used to find \(\gcd(a, b)\), and `func_2` is not relevant to the problem, the overall program structure is flawed. However, the individual components (`func_1`) are correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Given that `func_1` is correct but `func_2` is not relevant to the problem, the program as a whole does not correctly solve the given problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
