### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its functions step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
     - \(1 \le a \le n\)
     - \(1 \le b \le m\)
     - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is correctly implemented and works as expected.
   - However, it is not used in the main logic of the program, so it is irrelevant to the problem at hand.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` iterates over a range from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs some calculations involving \(n\) and \(i\).
   - Specifically, it calculates:
     - \(x = n - (i * i - i)\)
     - \(y = i * i\)
   - It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to a counter `cnt`.
   - Finally, it returns 1 if `cnt` is 0, otherwise it returns `cnt`.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2` with \(n\) and \(m\) and prints the result.

Given the problem description, let's verify if `func_2` actually counts the valid pairs \((a, b)\):

- The function `func_2` does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\).
- Instead, it seems to be performing some unrelated calculations that do not align with the problem's requirements.
- The calculations inside the loop do not involve checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Therefore, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the given problem because the function `func_2` does not perform the necessary checks and calculations to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).

**Final: False**
