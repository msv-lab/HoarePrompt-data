Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the conditions \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, but this is not used in the counting logic within `func_2`.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check whether the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Example usage:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This code iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, which is more straightforward and correct for the given problem.
