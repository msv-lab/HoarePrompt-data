### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The implementation is correct and works as expected.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function is intended to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The current implementation of `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here's why:

1. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over \(i\) from \(1\) to \(m-1\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It then increments the count `cnt` with `x // y + (i > 1)`.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The calculation of \(x\) and \(y\) does not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The logic inside the loop does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition directly. Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

This corrected function iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.

Given the original assessment, the current implementation of `func_2` is incorrect. However, the original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect without providing a detailed breakdown of the issues. Upon re-evaluation, we confirm that the logic in `func_2` does not match the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
