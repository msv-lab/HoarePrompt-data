You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\).
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, `a` and `b`. After the loop finishes executing, the variable `a` will hold the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of all m and n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`. This value depends on the specific values of `n` and `m`, but generally, it represents the cumulative result of the division and conditional addition operations performed within the loop.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`, and `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns a value of cnt which is the sum of x // y + (i > 1) for each i in the range from 1 to m-1, and cnt is not equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main problem statement, which requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1` computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in solving the main problem. The function `func_2` appears to be an attempt to solve a different problem, likely related to counting certain types of quadratic residues, but it does not meet the requirements of the given problem.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) holds true. The current implementation does not perform this check and instead uses a different approach that is not relevant to the problem.
