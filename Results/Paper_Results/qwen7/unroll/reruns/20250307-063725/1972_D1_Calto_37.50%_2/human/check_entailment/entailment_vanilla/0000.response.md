Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function aims to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Let's break it down:
     - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m-1`.
     - For each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
     - It then increments the count `cnt` with `x // y + (i > 1)`.
   - These calculations do not align with the problem statement. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Problem Statement Recap**:
   - We need to find pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checking the condition directly.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, compute `gcd(a, b)` and check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
