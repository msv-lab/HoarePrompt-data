Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `m`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is accurate and useful for further calculations involving the GCD.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This is where the core logic lies. Let's break down the logic inside `func_2`:
   - For each `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - It then adds `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`.
   - Finally, it checks if `cnt` is zero and returns 1 if true, otherwise returns `cnt`.

However, the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically, the problem requires checking pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The current implementation does not perform this check at all. Instead, it performs some arithmetic operations unrelated to the problem constraints.

Given the discrepancy between the required logic and the implemented logic, the function `func_2` is not solving the problem correctly.

Correctness: **False**
