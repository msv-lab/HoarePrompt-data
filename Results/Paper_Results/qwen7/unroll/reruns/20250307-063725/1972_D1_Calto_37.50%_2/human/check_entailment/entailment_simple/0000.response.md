Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The function returns the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is used in the main logic of the program.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
   - However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - Specifically, the loop and the calculations inside the loop do not align with the problem statement. The variables `x` and `y` are not defined in terms of `a` and `b`, and the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not checked.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be calculating something else, possibly related to a different mathematical concept rather than the problem's requirements.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach should involve iterating through possible values of `a` and `b`, checking if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`, and counting the valid pairs.

Since the provided `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution, the program as written is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
