Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` starts from 1 (as specified in the `range(1, m)`).
   - `m` is given as a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, the condition `1 < i < m` must hold true initially. Since `i` starts at 1, the loop will only execute if `m` is greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `cnt` is 0.
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- `m` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

We need to adjust the state of `i` and `m` to ensure the loop can execute. Specifically:
- `i` should start at 1.
- `m` must be greater than 1 to allow the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`cnt` is 0, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**
