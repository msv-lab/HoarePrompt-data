### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. Let's re-evaluate the function `func_2` and the overall program based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
The function `func_2` currently attempts to solve the problem by iterating over `i` from `1` to `m-1` and calculating `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`. It then increments the count `cnt` with `x // y + (i > 1)`. However, these calculations do not align with the problem statement. Specifically, the logic inside the loop does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve iterating over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly. For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the function summary provided:
- The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each `i` in the range from `1` to `m-1`, where `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
- If this sum equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.

This summary does not match the problem requirements. The summary suggests a different approach that does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem.
