### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_2` does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issues and verify the correct solution step-by-step.

#### Issues with `func_2`:
1. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `m-1`, and for each `i`, it calculates `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`.
   - These calculations do not align with the problem statement. The variables `x` and `y` do not represent any meaningful quantities related to the problem constraints.

2. **Logic Mismatch**:
   - The logic inside the loop does not check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Instead, it performs some arithmetic operations that are unrelated to the problem requirements.

3. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is not checked properly. The function should iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and verify this condition.

#### Correct Approach:
1. **Iterate Over All Pairs**:
   - Iterate over all possible values of `a` from `1` to `n` and `b` from `1` to `m`.

2. **Check the Condition**:
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, calculate `gcd(a, b)` using `func_1`.
   - Check if `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Count Valid Pairs**:
   - If the condition is satisfied, increment the count.

#### Correct Implementation:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate GCD
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Function to count valid pairs
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Main program
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original program uses an incorrect approach to solve the problem.
- The corrected program iterates over all possible pairs and checks the condition correctly.
- Given the corrected implementation, the original assessment was accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
