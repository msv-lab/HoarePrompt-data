Output State: **`tree` contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with `e` appended, and `prev` is equal to `curr`; `start` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `start = int(input())` assigns the value of the input received from the user to the variable `start`. The initial state of `tree` and `prev` remains unchanged. Therefore, `tree` still contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with `e` appended, and `prev` is still equal to `curr`. The variable `start` now holds the value of the integer input provided by the user.
