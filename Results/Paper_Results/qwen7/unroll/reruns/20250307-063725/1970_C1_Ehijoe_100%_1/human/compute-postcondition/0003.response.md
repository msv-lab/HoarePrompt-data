Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `edges` is an empty list; `empty` is True; `nodes` is a defaultdict where all values are initially lists.**

Explanation: The line `nodes = defaultdict(list)` creates a default dictionary named `nodes` where all values are initialized as lists. This does not change the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `edges`, or `empty`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
