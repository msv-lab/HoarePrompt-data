Output State: **`tree` contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with `e` appended, and `prev` is equal to `curr`; `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`.**

Explanation: The code `idx = tree.index(start)` finds the index of `start` within the list `tree` and assigns it to the variable `idx`. The other variables (`tree`, `prev`, `curr`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
