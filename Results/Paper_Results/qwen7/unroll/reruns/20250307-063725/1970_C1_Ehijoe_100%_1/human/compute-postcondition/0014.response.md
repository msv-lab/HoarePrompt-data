Output State: **`prev` is `s`, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers determined by user input for each iteration of the loop, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `edges` is a list containing pairs of integers representing edges between nodes, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers (node IDs) and values are lists of integers (adjacent node IDs), `ends` is a list containing all node IDs that have only one adjacent node after the loop executes all the iterations, `s` is an element from the `ends` list, `e` is an element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing the element `s`, `curr` is the first adjacent node of `s`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the first adjacent node of `s` (which is a node ID) to the variable `curr`. Since `s` is an element from the `ends` list, it means `s` has only one adjacent node. The other variables remain unchanged.
