Output State: **`tree` contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with `e` appended, and `prev` is equal to `curr`; `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`; `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `moves` containing two elements: `idx` and `n - idx - 1`. The value of `n` is not specified, but it is implied to be the length of the `tree` list since `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`. The other variables (`tree`, `prev`, `curr`, and `start`) remain unchanged.
