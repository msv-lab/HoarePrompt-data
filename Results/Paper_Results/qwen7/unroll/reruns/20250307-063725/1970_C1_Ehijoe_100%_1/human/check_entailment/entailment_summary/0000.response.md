Reasoning:
1. The problem involves a tree with exactly two leaves, which can be treated as an array.
2. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of nodes `n`, the number of rounds `t` (which is fixed at 1), and the starting node for each round.
3. The program constructs the tree and identifies the two leaves.
4. It then constructs a path from one leaf to the other, effectively treating the tree as an array.
5. The program calculates the index of the starting node within this path and determines the number of moves required to reach the starting node from one end of the path.
6. Based on the parity of the number of moves, it decides the winner of the round.
7. The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the moves is correct and aligns with the rules of the game.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic for determining the winner of each round based on the given rules.

Correctness: **True**
