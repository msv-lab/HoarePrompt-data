Output State: **The variable `tree` will contain a path from node `s` to node `e` in the graph, and `prev` will be set to `curr` at the end of the loop.**

Explanation: The loop constructs a path from node `s` to node `e` by traversing through adjacent nodes. It alternates between the two adjacent nodes of the current node (`curr`) until it reaches `e`. The `prev` variable keeps track of the previous node in the path. After the loop completes, `curr` will be equal to `e`, and `prev` will be set to `curr`, meaning `prev` will hold the last node in the constructed path, which is `e`. The `tree` list will contain all the nodes visited on this path from `s` to `e`.
