Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `prev` is `s`, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers determined by user input for each iteration of the loop, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `edges` is a list containing pairs of integers representing edges between nodes, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers (node IDs) and values are lists of integers (adjacent node IDs), `ends` is a list containing all node IDs that have only one adjacent node after the loop executes all the iterations, `s` is an element from the `ends` list, `e` is an element from the `ends` list, `tree` is a list containing the element `s`, `curr` is the first adjacent node of `s`.
Code of the loop:
while curr != e:
    tree.append(curr)
    if nodes[curr][0] == prev:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][1]
    else:
        prev = curr
        curr = nodes[curr][0]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
