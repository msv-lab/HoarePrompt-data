Output State: **`tree` contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with `e` appended, and `prev` is equal to `curr`.**

Explanation: The code `tree.append(e)` appends the node `e` to the list `tree`. This means that the path stored in `tree` now includes the node `e`. Additionally, the statement `prev = curr` sets `prev` to the current value of `curr`. Therefore, after executing these lines of code, `tree` will contain the updated path, and `prev` will hold the value of `curr`.
