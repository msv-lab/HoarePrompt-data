### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t`. Since `t` is always 1 in this problem, it is not used.
   - The program constructs the tree using adjacency lists. It correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree.

2. **Path Finding**:
   - The program correctly finds the path between the two leaves. It initializes the path with the first leaf and iteratively builds the path to the second leaf.

3. **Start Node Identification**:
   - The program correctly reads the starting node for the game.

4. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distance from the starting node to the first leaf (`idx`) and to the second leaf (`n - idx - 1`).
   - The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the sum of these distances is odd or even. If the sum is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - Given that the tree is special (array-like with exactly two leaves), the optimal strategy involves moving the stone along the path between the two leaves. The program correctly identifies the distances and determines the winner based on these distances.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Ron" or "Hermione" based on the calculated distances, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. There are no logical errors or issues with the implementation.
