Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` is an integer such that 1 ≤ u ≤ n, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `edges` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `edges`. This does not change the values of `t`, `u`, `v`, or `n`, but it adds the new information that `edges` is now an empty list.
