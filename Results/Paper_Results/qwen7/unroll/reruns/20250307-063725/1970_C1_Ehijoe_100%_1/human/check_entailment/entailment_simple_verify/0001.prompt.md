You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Tree Construction**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of nodes `n` and the number of rounds `t`. Since `t` is always 1 in this problem, it is not used.
   - The program constructs the tree using adjacency lists. It correctly identifies the two leaves of the tree.

2. **Path Finding**:
   - The program correctly finds the path between the two leaves. It initializes the path with the first leaf and iteratively builds the path to the second leaf.

3. **Start Node Identification**:
   - The program correctly reads the starting node for the game.

4. **Move Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the distance from the starting node to the first leaf (`idx`) and to the second leaf (`n - idx - 1`).
   - The logic to determine the winner is based on whether the sum of these distances is odd or even. If the sum is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.

5. **Optimal Play**:
   - Given that the tree is special (array-like with exactly two leaves), the optimal strategy involves moving the stone along the path between the two leaves. The program correctly identifies the distances and determines the winner based on these distances.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs "Ron" or "Hermione" based on the calculated distances, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. There are no logical errors or issues with the implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**
