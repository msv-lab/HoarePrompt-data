Output State: **`t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers determined by user input for each iteration of the loop, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ n, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5; `edges` is a list containing pairs of integers representing edges between nodes, `empty` is False, `nodes` is a defaultdict where keys are integers (node IDs) and values are lists of integers (adjacent node IDs), `ends` is a list containing all node IDs that have only one adjacent node after the loop executes all the iterations, `s` is an element from the `ends` list, `e` is an element from the `ends` list.**

Explanation: The code `s, e = list(ends)` extracts two elements from the `ends` list and assigns them to the variables `s` and `e`. The values of `t`, `u`, `v`, `n`, `edges`, `empty`, and `nodes` remain unchanged from their initial state. The `ends` list is modified during the loop iterations, and now `s` and `e` hold the values of two elements from this list.
