Postcondition: `tree` contains the path from node `s` to node `e` with `e` appended, `prev` is equal to `curr`, `start` is an input integer, `idx` is the index of `start` in `tree`, and `moves` is a list containing `[idx, n - idx - 1]`. If any move in `moves` is odd, then any move in `moves` is odd. If all moves in `moves` are even, then all moves in `moves` are even.
