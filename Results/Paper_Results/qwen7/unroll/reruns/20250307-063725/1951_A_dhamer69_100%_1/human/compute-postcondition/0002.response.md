Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `t`.

For each value of `n` and string `s`:
- If `n` is 2 and `s` is exactly '00', it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not 2:
  - It counts the number of '1's in `s`. If this count is odd, it prints 'NO'.
  - If there is exactly one occurrence of '11' and the count of '1's is exactly 2, it also prints 'NO'.
  - In all other cases, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depending on the input values of `n` and `s` for each iteration of the loop.
