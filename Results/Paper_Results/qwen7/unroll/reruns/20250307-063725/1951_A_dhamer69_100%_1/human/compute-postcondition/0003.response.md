Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body.

The loop runs `t` times. For each iteration:
- If `n` equals 2, it checks if the string `s` is exactly '00'. If true, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
- If `n` is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. If this count is odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count is 2 and there is exactly one occurrence of '11', it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed during the loop's execution, with each line corresponding to one iteration of the loop.
