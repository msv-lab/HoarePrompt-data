Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: 
   - `t` is an input integer.
   - `start` and `end` are integers such that `start <= end`.
   - These values are used to filter folder names which should be digits within the specified range.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t > 0` must be true.
   - Right before the loop, `t` is an input integer, but we don't know its exact value. 

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - No other states (like `start` and `end`) need to be adjusted because they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
