The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of an integer `t`, followed by `t` pairs of inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. Based on the value of `n`, it either checks if `s` is exactly '00' or counts the occurrences of '1' in `s` and checks specific conditions. For each pair, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. The function does not return any value but outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the given conditions.
