Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. Additionally, it accepts a list of adjacency lists `adj`, where `adj[i]` contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex `i`. The graph is represented as an undirected tree. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints and relationships.**
