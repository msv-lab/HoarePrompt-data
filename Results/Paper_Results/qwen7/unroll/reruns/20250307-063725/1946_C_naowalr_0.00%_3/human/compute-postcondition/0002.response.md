Output State: **t test cases where for each case, the value of L is printed after performing binary search to find the maximum number of cuts such that the number of cuts does not exceed k and the leftover length is at least x.**

This means that for each of the t test cases, the loop will execute, and the final value of `L` will be determined based on the binary search process described in the loop body. The value of `L` represents the maximum number of cuts that can be made such that the number of cuts does not exceed `k` and the leftover length is at least `x`.
