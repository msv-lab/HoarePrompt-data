You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and represent the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. adj is a list of adjacency lists where adj[i] contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex i. The graph is represented as an undirected tree.
def func_1():
    t = int(sys.stdin.readline())
    for z in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
        
        adj = [[] for i in range(n + 1)]
        
        for i in range(n - 1):
            a, b = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))
            adj[a].append(b)
            adj[b].append(a)
        
        L = 1
        
        R = int(100000.0 + 1)
        
        numCuts = 0
        
        while R - L > 1:
            x = (L + R) // 2
            numCuts = 0
            leftover = dfs(1, 1)
            if numCuts > k or numCuts == k and leftover >= x:
                L = x
            else:
                R = x
        
        print(L)
        
    #State: t test cases where for each case, the value of L is printed after performing binary search to find the maximum number of cuts such that the number of cuts does not exceed k and the leftover length is at least x.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, representing the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. Additionally, it accepts a list of adjacency lists `adj`, where `adj[i]` contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex `i`. The graph is represented as an undirected tree. The function does not return anything explicitly but processes the input data according to the given constraints and relationships.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
