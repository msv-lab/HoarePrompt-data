Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `sys.stdin.readline()` is called to read the first line of input which assigns the value to `t`.**

The code reads the first line of input from `sys.stdin` and assigns it to `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `k`, and the adjacency list `adj` remain unchanged and still follow the initial conditions provided.
