Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving a tree represented by its number of vertices `n`, the number of edges to be removed `k`, and an adjacency list `adj`. For each test case, it performs a binary search to find the maximum number of cuts such that the number of cuts does not exceed `k` and the remaining part of the tree has at least `x` vertices. It prints the result `L` for each test case.**
