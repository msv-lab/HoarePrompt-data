t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and represent the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed, respectively. adj is a list of adjacency lists where adj[i] contains the list of vertices adjacent to vertex i. The graph is represented as an undirected tree.
