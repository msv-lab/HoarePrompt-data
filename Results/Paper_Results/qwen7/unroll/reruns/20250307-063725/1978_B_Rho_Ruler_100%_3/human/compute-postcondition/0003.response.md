Output State: **The value of `low` is greater than or equal to `high`, `max_profit` contains the maximum profit calculated from `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any `mid` within the range of `low` to `high`.**

Explanation: After the loop completes, the condition `low > high` will be true because the loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. The variable `max_profit` will hold the highest profit value obtained from calling `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any midpoint `mid` during the iterations of the loop.
