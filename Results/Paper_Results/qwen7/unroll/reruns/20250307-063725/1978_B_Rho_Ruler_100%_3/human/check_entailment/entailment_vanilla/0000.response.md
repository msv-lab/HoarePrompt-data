### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit function is defined by the `func_1` which calculates the total profit based on the value of \( k \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It uses the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively checks the middle point \( mid \) and compares the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \), which means all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the results match the expected outputs.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to be correct and handles all scenarios appropriately.
