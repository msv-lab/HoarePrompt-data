Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly finds the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.

1. **Understanding `func_1`**: 
   - This function calculates the profit when the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` and the remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - The formula used in `func_1` is correct: `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`**:
   - This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - The binary search is performed over the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.
   - For each midpoint `mid` in the range, it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and `func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)`.
   - If the profit of `mid + 1` is greater than `mid`, it means increasing `k` increases the profit, so it moves the lower bound `low` up to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, it decreases the upper bound `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and the maximum profit found during the process is returned.

3. **Verification**:
   - The binary search approach is appropriate here because the profit function is monotonically increasing with respect to `k` within the specified range.
   - The implementation correctly handles the edge cases where `k` could be 0 or `min(n, b)`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should correctly determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain.

Correctness: **True**
