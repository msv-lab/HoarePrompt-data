The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. Here, `n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ b ≤ min(n, b). The function calculates the maximum profit by evaluating `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any `mid` within a specified range (low to high) and returns the maximum profit found.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns the maximum profit calculated from `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any `mid` within the specified range.**
