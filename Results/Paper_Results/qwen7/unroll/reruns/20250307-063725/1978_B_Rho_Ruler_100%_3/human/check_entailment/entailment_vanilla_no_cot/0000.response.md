Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all \( n \) buns under the given promotional conditions.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the profit when selling the first \( k \) buns at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \). The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
   \]
   This formula accounts for the decreasing price of the first \( k \) buns and the fixed price of the remaining buns.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of possible values for \( k \) from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \).

- **Binary Search Logic**:
  - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
  - Calculate the middle point `mid`.
  - Compute the profit for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
  - Update `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits.
  - Adjust the search range based on whether the profit of `mid + 1` is greater than the profit of `mid`.

The implementation correctly handles all test cases provided in the example, including edge cases where \( k \) might be 0 or when \( b \) is much larger than \( n \). Therefore, the program is correct.
