Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It then calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the buns using a binary search approach, where the profit is determined by another function \( \text{func\_1} \). The function ensures that the profit is maximized over the range of possible values for the modified price.**
