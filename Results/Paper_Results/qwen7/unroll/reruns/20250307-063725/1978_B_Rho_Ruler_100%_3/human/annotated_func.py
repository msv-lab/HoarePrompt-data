#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the expression `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a monetary value based on the number of buns (`n`), the usual price of a bun (`a`), the price of the first bun sold at a modified price (`b`), and the count of buns sold at the modified price (`k`). Specifically, it computes the total revenue considering the first `k` buns are sold at the modified price `b`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. Additionally, 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9, and 0 ≤ b ≤ min(n, b).
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State: The value of `low` is greater than or equal to `high`, `max_profit` contains the maximum profit calculated from `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any `mid` within the range of `low` to `high`.
    return max_profit
    #The program returns max_profit which is the maximum profit calculated from func_1(mid, n, a, b) for any mid within the range of low to high.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It then calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the buns using a binary search approach, where the profit is determined by another function \( \text{func\_1} \). The function ensures that the profit is maximized over the range of possible values for the modified price.
