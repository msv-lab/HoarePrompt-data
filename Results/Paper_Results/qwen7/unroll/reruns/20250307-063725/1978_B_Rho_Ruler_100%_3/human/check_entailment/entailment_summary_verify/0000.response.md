### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k`:
\[ \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \]

Here's what this formula means:
- \( k \times b \): The total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices.
- \( -\frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} \): This term adjusts the revenue from the modified prices to account for the decreasing price of each subsequent bun.
- \( (n - k) \times a \): The total revenue from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit:
1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
2. Use a while loop to perform binary search until `low` exceeds `high`.
3. Calculate the middle point `mid` and use `func_1` to compute the profit for `k = mid` and `k = mid + 1`.
4. Update `max_profit` with the maximum of the two profits.
5. Adjust the search range based on which profit is higher.

The function summary correctly describes the behavior of `func_2` as using a binary search approach to find the maximum profit.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, let's verify the correctness of the program:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - When `k = 0`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
   - When `k = n`, the first `k` buns are sold at the modified prices, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`.

2. **Intermediate Values**:
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal `k` is found by comparing the profits for `k` and `k + 1`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case when `n` is much larger than `b` by setting the upper limit of the binary search to `min(n, b)`.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and the profit calculation in `func_1` is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions.
