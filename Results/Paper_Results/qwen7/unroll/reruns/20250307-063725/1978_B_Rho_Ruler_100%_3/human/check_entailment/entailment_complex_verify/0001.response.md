### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit function is defined by the `func_1` which calculates the total profit based on the value of \( k \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively checks the middle point \( mid \) and compares the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \), which means all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the results match the expected outputs.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before calling `func_1`, the state is as described in the annotation.
  - The function `func_1` correctly implements the profit calculation formula.
  
- **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
  - The binary search logic is correct and ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found.
  - The loop invariant is maintained correctly, and the `max_profit` variable is updated properly.
  - The `low` and `high` variables are updated based on the comparison of profits, ensuring the search space is narrowed down effectively.

- **Edge Case Handling:**
  - The edge case where \( k = 0 \) is handled correctly, as the function `func_1` will calculate the profit for all buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

### Validation Against the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies the use of binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
- The formula used in `func_1` is accurately described and implemented.
- Edge cases are correctly handled.
- The examples provided in the problem statement are correctly matched.
