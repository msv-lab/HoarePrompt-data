Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `low <= high`.
2. We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.
3. The variables involved in the loop condition are `low` and `high`.

- Before the loop, `low` is 0.
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true.

Given:
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.

Since `low` is 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `high` must be greater than or equal to 0. However, since `high` is defined as the minimum of `n` and `b`, and both `n` and `b` are non-negative (as they are typically used in such contexts), `high` will always be non-negative.

Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `high` because it will naturally satisfy the condition `low <= high` given that `low` is 0.

So, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`, `max_profit` is 0**
