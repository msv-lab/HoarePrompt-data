### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit function is defined by the `func_1` which calculates the total profit based on the value of \( k \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively checks the middle point \( mid \) and compares the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \), which means all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the results match the expected outputs.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before calling `func_2`, the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) are correctly initialized.
  - The binary search in `func_2` is designed to find the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).

- **Key Points in `func_2`:**
  - The binary search correctly narrows down the range of \( k \) by updating `low` and `high` based on the comparison of profits.
  - The `max_profit` variable accumulates the maximum profit found during the binary search.

- **Final State:**
  - After the loop, `low` will be greater than `high`, indicating that the optimal \( k \) has been found.
  - The function returns `max_profit`, which is the maximum profit achievable.

### Verification:

- **Correctness of `func_1`:**
  - The formula used in `func_1` is correct and accurately calculates the profit for a given \( k \).

- **Correctness of `func_2`:**
  - The binary search in `func_2` correctly identifies the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
  - The initialization of `low` and `high` is appropriate, and the loop terminates when the optimal \( k \) is found.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \), ensuring that all buns are sold at the usual price.

- **Testing:**
  - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by choosing the optimal \( k \) using binary search and the profit calculation function.
