You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (0, min(n, b))
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts three parameters \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \), representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It then calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the buns using a binary search approach, where the profit is determined by another function \( \text{func\_1} \). The function ensures that the profit is maximized over the range of possible values for the modified price.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit function is defined by the `func_1` which calculates the total profit based on the value of \( k \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It uses the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively checks the middle point \( mid \) and compares the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \), which means all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the results match the expected outputs.

Given the above analysis, the implementation appears to be correct and handles all scenarios appropriately.
