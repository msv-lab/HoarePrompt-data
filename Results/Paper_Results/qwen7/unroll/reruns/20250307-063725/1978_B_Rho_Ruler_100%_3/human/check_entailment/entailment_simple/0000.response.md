Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) (where \( 0 \leq k \leq \min(n, b) \)).
   - The profit calculation involves selling the first \( k \) buns at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code correctly defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` calculates the profit for a given \( k \) using the formula: \( k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a \).
   - `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.

3. **Binary Search Explanation**:
   - The binary search in `func_2` iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values to find the maximum profit.
   - It checks the profit for the middle point \( mid \) and compares it with the profit for \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is higher, it updates the lower bound; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \) correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found within the specified range.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in both functions is sound and correctly implements the required calculations.
   - The binary search approach is efficient and ensures that the maximum profit is found.

Given the above analysis, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
