Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \) (number of buns sold at the modified price). The formula used is:
   \[
   \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
   \]
   This formula accounts for the revenue from the first \( k \) buns sold at prices \( b, b-1, \ldots, b-k+1 \) and the remaining \( n-k \) buns sold at the usual price \( a \).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit. The binary search iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \). For each midpoint \( \text{mid} \) in the current range, it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit of the next possible \( k \) value (\( \text{mid} + 1 \)). If the profit increases, it moves the lower bound up; otherwise, it moves the upper bound down. This process continues until the optimal \( k \) is found.

3. **Input and Output Handling**: The main part of the code correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases and processing each test case by calling `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the logic in both `func_1` and `func_2` aligns with the requirements. The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the maximum profit is found efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
