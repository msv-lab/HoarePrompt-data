### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k`:
```python
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
```
- `k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the total revenue from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices.
- `(n - k) * a` calculates the total revenue from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

The formula for the modified price is:
\[ \text{Modified Price} = b - (i - 1) \]
Summing these up for the first `k` buns gives:
\[ \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - (i - 1)) = b \cdot k - \frac{k(k - 1)}{2} \]

This part of the function is correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit:
```python
def func_2(n, a, b):
    low, high = 0, min(n, b)
    max_profit = 0
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        profit_mid = func_1(mid, n, a, b)
        profit_next = func_1(mid + 1, n, a, b)
        max_profit = max(max_profit, profit_mid)
        if profit_next > profit_mid:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return max_profit
```
- The binary search is used to find the optimal `k` by comparing the profits for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
- If `profit_next > profit_mid`, it means increasing `k` increases the profit, so we move the lower bound (`low`) to `mid + 1`.
- Otherwise, we move the upper bound (`high`) to `mid - 1`.

The binary search approach is correct because it efficiently narrows down the optimal `k` by comparing the profits of consecutive values.

#### Main Program:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(func_2(n, a, b))
```
- The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The binary search in `func_2` correctly finds the optimal `k` by comparing the profits for `mid` and `mid + 1`.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for a given `k`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions. The binary search in `func_2` ensures that the optimal `k` is found efficiently, and `func_1` correctly calculates the profit for any given `k`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
