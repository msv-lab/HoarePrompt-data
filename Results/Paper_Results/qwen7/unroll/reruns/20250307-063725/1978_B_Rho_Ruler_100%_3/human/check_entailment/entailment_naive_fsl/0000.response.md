Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function calculates the profit for a given value of `k`. It computes the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices and the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of possible values for `k` using the `func_1` function to compute profits for different values of `k`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:
- When `k = 0`, all buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- When `k = n`, the first `k` buns are sold at the modified prices, and the remaining buns are sold at the usual price `a`.
- For intermediate values of `k`, the program correctly calculates the profit and finds the maximum possible profit.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
