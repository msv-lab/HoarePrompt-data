### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \).
   - The profit function is defined by the `func_1` which calculates the total profit based on the value of \( k \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Binary Search in `func_2`:**
   - The function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \).
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively checks the middle point \( mid \) and compares the profit for \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \), which means all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are tested and the results match the expected outputs.

### Analysis of the Original Assessment:

- The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the profit for a given \( k \) using the provided formula.
- The original assessment also correctly identifies that the function `func_2` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
- The original assessment mentions handling edge cases and testing with examples, which are correct.

### Verification:

- The function `func_1` correctly implements the profit calculation formula.
- The binary search in `func_2` correctly finds the optimal \( k \) by comparing profits for different values of \( k \).
- The function handles edge cases properly, such as when \( k = 0 \).
- The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the functions.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit by choosing the optimal \( k \).
