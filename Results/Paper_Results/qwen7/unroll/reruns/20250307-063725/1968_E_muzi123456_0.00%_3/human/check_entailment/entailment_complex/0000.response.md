Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to generate the required output for each test case. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. **Loop Execution**: For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
3. **Output Generation**: It then prints `n` lines for each test case, where each line starts with `1` followed by a number from `1` to `n`. This ensures that all possible pairs of cells are covered, thus maximizing the number of unique Manhattan distances.
4. **Formatting**: After printing the `n` lines for each test case, it prints a newline to separate the outputs of different test cases.

Given the problem statement and the examples provided, the program correctly generates the required output. Each test case is handled independently, and the output format matches the expected format.

Correctness: **True**
