Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program does not actually compute or maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\). Instead, it simply prints a pattern where each cell in the first row has coordinates \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\).
3. This pattern does not necessarily maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\). For example, for \(n = 3\), the given pattern would print:
   ```
   1 1
   1 2
   1 3
   ```
   This results in only three distinct Manhattan distances: 0, 1, and 2, but the optimal solution should include all possible distances up to \(n-1\).
4. The execution summary indicates that the program prints a series of blocks, each containing \(n\) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \(n\). However, this does not address the requirement to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
