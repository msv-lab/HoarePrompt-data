You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the while loop. For each iteration, there will be `n` lines printed, where the first line prints "1" followed by the number `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), and the second line prints a space. This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the initial value provided as input.
    #
    #For example, if `t` is 2 and `n` is 3 during the first iteration and 4 during the second iteration, the output would look like:
    #
    #```
    #1 1 
    # 1 2 
    # 1 3 
    #
    # 1 1 
    # 1 2 
    # 1 3 
    # 1 4 
    #```
    #
    #This pattern continues until the while loop has executed `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, the function returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
