Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers: `t` (number of iterations, 1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and `n` (a value used in a loop, 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, it prints `t` blocks, each block containing `n` lines. Each line in a block starts with '1' followed by a number from 1 to `n`, with a space between them. After printing each block, it prints a newline.**
