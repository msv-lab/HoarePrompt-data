Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells. For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program outputs:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

The Manhattan distances calculated from these points are:

- Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
- Distance between (1,1) and (1,3): \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
- Distance between (1,2) and (1,3): \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)

Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{1, 2\}\), which only has 2 elements. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), as shown in the problem's note.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
