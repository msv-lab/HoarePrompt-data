### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The provided function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) coordinates, all having the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) but different \( y \)-coordinates from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Manhattan Distances**:
   - For the given coordinates \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\):
     - The Manhattan distance between any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |i - j| \).
     - This results in the set of distances being \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

4. **Maximizing the Set of Distances**:
   - The set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\) has exactly \( n \) distinct values.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances, which means we need to consider all possible pairs of cells, not just those with the same \( x \)-coordinate.

5. **Verification**:
   - The solution provided only considers the Manhattan distances within the same row. While this achieves \( n \) distinct distances for the chosen points, it does not necessarily maximize the set of distances for all possible pairs of cells.
   - For example, for \( n = 3 \), the set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2\}\) is achieved, but other configurations might achieve more distinct distances. For instance, placing points at \((1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)\) would give distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4\}\), which includes more distinct values.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not guarantee the maximum possible set of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases. It only considers a specific configuration that may not always yield the maximum set of distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is not correct because it does not guarantee the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all test cases.
