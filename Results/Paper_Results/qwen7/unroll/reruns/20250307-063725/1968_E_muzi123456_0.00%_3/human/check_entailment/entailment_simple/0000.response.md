Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program initializes the number of test cases \(t\) and iterates through each test case, generating \(n\) points in a specific pattern.
3. For each test case, the program prints \(n\) points in the form of \((1, i)\) for \(i\) ranging from 1 to \(n\).
4. This pattern ensures that all points lie on the same row (row 1), which means the Manhattan distance between any two points will only depend on their column indices.
5. The Manhattan distance between any two points \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \(|i - j|\). Since \(i\) and \(j\) range from 1 to \(n\), the possible distances are \(0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\).
6. Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain \(n\) distinct values, which is the maximum possible size for \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
