### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The provided function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) coordinates, all having the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) but different \( y \)-coordinates from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Manhattan Distances**:
   - For the given coordinates \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\):
     - The Manhattan distance between any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |i - j| \).
     - This results in the set of distances being \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

4. **Maximizing the Set of Distances**:
   - The set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\) has exactly \( n \) distinct values.
   - This is the maximum possible number of distinct Manhattan distances for \( n \) points in an \( n \times n \) grid because the maximum distance between any two points is \( 2(n-1) \), but achieving all intermediate values is not guaranteed without specific placement.

5. **Verification**:
   - The solution provided ensures that the Manhattan distances cover the range from 0 to \( n-1 \), which is the maximum possible for \( n \) points.
   - Therefore, the solution correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Hence, the program is correct.
