Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 50\).
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

Given that `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 50\), it is guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `t` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

Since there are no other variables in the loop head that need adjustment, we do not need to modify any additional states.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3**
