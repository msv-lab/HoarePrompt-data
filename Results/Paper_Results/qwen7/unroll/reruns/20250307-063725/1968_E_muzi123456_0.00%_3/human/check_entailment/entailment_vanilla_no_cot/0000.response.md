Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply prints `n` points of the form `(1, i)` for `i` ranging from `1` to `n`. This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the example for \(n = 3\):

- The program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

- The Manhattan distances are calculated as follows:
  - Distance between (1,1) and (1,2): \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\)
  - Distance between (1,1) and (1,3): \(|1-1| + |1-3| = 2\)
  - Distance between (1,2) and (1,3): \(|1-1| + |2-3| = 1\)

Thus, the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) is \(\{1, 2\}\), which has a size of 2. However, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) should include more points to maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, the optimal solution for \(n = 3\) would be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```

This configuration results in the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
