Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) and an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). For each test case, the function returns a value based on the relationship between `t` and `n`.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`, and based on their values, the function returns a specific result for each case. However, since the function definition does not specify the exact return value, the focus here is on the nature of the input and implied processing.
