Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to an iteration of the outer while loop. For each iteration, there will be `n` lines printed. Each of these `n` lines will start with '1' followed by the current value of `i` (from 1 to `n`), separated by spaces. After printing these `n` lines, a blank line will be printed.

To provide a concrete example, if `t` is 2 and the inputs for `n` are 3 and 4 respectively, the output would look like this:

```
1 1 
1 2 
1 3 

1 1 
1 2 
1 3 
1 4 
```

Each number from 1 to `n` is printed on a separate line within its block, and each block is followed by a blank line. This pattern repeats for each value of `t`.
