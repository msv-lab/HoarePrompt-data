Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to one iteration of the while loop. For each iteration, there will be `n` lines printed, where the first line prints "1" followed by the number `i` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), and the second line prints a space. This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the initial value provided as input.

For example, if `t` is 2 and `n` is 3 during the first iteration and 4 during the second iteration, the output would look like:

```
1 1 
 1 2 
 1 3 

 1 1 
 1 2 
 1 3 
 1 4 
```

This pattern continues until the while loop has executed `t` times.
