Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, the input for `t` must also fall within this range. After executing the code, `t` retains its value as an integer input from the user, and the precondition for `n` remains unchanged, meaning `n` is still an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3.
