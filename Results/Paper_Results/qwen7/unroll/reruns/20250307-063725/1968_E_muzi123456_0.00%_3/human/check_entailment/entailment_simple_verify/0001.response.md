### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
   - The Manhattan distance between two cells \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by \( |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The provided function `func()` reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It then prints \( n \) coordinates, all having the same \( x \)-coordinate (1) but different \( y \)-coordinates from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Checking the Manhattan Distances**:
   - For the given coordinates \((1, 1), (1, 2), \ldots, (1, n)\):
     - The Manhattan distance between any two cells \((1, i)\) and \((1, j)\) is \( |i - j| \).
     - This results in the set of distances being \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\).

4. **Maximizing the Set of Distances**:
   - The set of distances \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\) has exactly \( n \) distinct values.
   - However, the problem requires maximizing the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any pair of cells, not just those with the same \( x \)-coordinate.

5. **Verification**:
   - The solution provided only considers points with the same \( x \)-coordinate, which does not necessarily maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all pairs of points.
   - For example, consider \( n = 3 \). The coordinates \((1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)\) result in distances \(\{0, 1, 2\}\), but other configurations might yield additional distinct distances.

6. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider \( n = 3 \):
     - Coordinates: \((1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)\)
     - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4\}\)
     - Here, the set of distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\), which has 5 distinct values, more than the 3 distinct values obtained by the provided solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The provided solution only considers points with the same \( x \)-coordinate, which does not guarantee the maximum number of distinct distances.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
