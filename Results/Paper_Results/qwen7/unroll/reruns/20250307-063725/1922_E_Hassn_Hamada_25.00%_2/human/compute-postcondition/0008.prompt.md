You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).

To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).

The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.

For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.

Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
```
for i in range(size):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
