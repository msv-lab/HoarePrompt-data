You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, and sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 

    Returns: 
        int: The size of generated sequence

    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the function returns the size of the generated sequence. The value of number is not 0
    size = 1
    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    #
    #To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).
    #
    #The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.
    #
    #For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
    #- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
    #- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
    #- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
    #- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.
    #
    #Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `result` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` (for `i` in range `size`) has been incremented by `result`. The rest of the elements in `sequence` remain unchanged from the initial state.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the value of `size + result` where `size` is the length of the list `sequence` and `result` is the number of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by `result` at their respective indices.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `number`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, which is a list of integers with each element in the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns either 0 or the sum of the length of the list `sequence` and the count of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by their index value.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the value of `size + result` where `size` is the length of the list `sequence` and `result` is the number of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by `result` at their respective indices.
