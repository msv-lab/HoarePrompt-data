    #State: number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the function returns the size of the generated sequence. The value of number is not 0

        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    #
    #To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).
    #
    #The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.
    #
    #For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
    #- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
    #- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
    #- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
    #- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.
    #
    #Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `result` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` (for `i` in range `size`) has been incremented by `result`. The rest of the elements in `sequence` remain unchanged from the initial state.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the value of `size + result` where `size` is the length of the list `sequence` and `result` is the number of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by `result` at their respective indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing certain elements. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the highest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\), appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence`, recursively processes the remaining part of `number`, and finally returns the sum of `size` and the count of elements incremented during the recursion.
