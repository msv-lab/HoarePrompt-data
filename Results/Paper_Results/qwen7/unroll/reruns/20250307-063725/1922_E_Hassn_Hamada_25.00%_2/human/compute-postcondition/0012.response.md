Output State: **`result` is the return value of `func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)`, `number` is the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\), `size` is unchanged, and `sequence` is unchanged.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1` with two arguments: `number - (1 << size) + 1` and `sequence`. The value of `size` is determined by the initial condition, which means it does not change after the function call. The `number` remains the same as per the initial state. The `sequence` variable is also not affected by the given code snippet. The `result` variable is assigned the return value of the function call, which depends on the implementation of `func_1`.
