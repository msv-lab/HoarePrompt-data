Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    if (number == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9], and the function returns the size of the generated sequence. The value of number is not 0

    while (1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number:
        size += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    #
    #To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).
    #
    #The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.
    #
    #For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
    #- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
    #- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
    #- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
    #- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.
    #
    #Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    result = func_1(number - (1 << size) + 1, sequence)
    for i in range(size):
        assert -len(sequence) <= -result - i - 1 <= -1
        
        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `result` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` (for `i` in range `size`) has been incremented by `result`. The rest of the elements in `sequence` remain unchanged from the initial state.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the value of `size + result` where `size` is the length of the list `sequence` and `result` is the number of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by `result` at their respective indices.
