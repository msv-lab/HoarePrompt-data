You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    #
    #To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).
    #
    #The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.
    #
    #For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
    #- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
    #- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
    #- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
    #- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.
    #
    #Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
    for i in range(size):
        sequence.append(i)

        sequence[-result - i - 1] += result
        
    #State: Output State: `result` remains the same, `sequence` is a list where each element at index `-result - i - 1` (for `i` in range `size`) has been incremented by `result`. The rest of the elements in `sequence` remain unchanged from the initial state.
    return size + result
    #The program returns the value of `size + result` where `size` is the length of the list `sequence` and `result` is the number of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by `result` at their respective indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing certain elements. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the highest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\), appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence`, recursively processes the remaining part of `number`, and finally returns the sum of `size` and the count of elements incremented during the recursion.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

For example, consider the input `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence that meets this requirement, but it fails to do so correctly. The generated sequence might not always have the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by `X`. The logic within `func_1` does not guarantee that the sequence will have the desired number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`.

To illustrate, let's consider a simpler example where `X = 5`. The correct approach would involve generating a sequence like `[0, 1, 0, 2]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the provided code does not guarantee this behavior for all inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
