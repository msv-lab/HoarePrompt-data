### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number `number` and updates the `sequence` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed and appends values accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - After generating the sequence, the code prints its length and the sequence itself.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the construction of the sequence and the assertion checks ensure the sequence is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing `[0]`, which is correct since an array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty increasing subsequence (the element itself).
   - The code handles larger values of `X` by constructing sequences that meet the requirement.

6. **Validation:**
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The assertions within the function help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the logic and implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Increasing Subsequences:**
  - The function `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The approach used in `func_1` relies on binary representation, but it does not account for the exact count of increasing subsequences.
  - For example, consider `X = 13`. The function will generate a sequence that might not have exactly 13 increasing subsequences. The current implementation does not ensure that the sequence will have the exact number of increasing subsequences.

- **Assertions and Logic:**
  - The assertions within the function are not sufficient to validate the exact count of increasing subsequences. They only check the structure of the sequence but do not verify the count of increasing subsequences.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - While the code handles the case where `X = 2` correctly, it does not handle other edge cases like when `X` is a prime number or a number that cannot be represented as a sum of powers of 2 minus 1.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_1` does not guarantee that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
