You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing certain elements. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the highest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\), appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence`, recursively processes the remaining part of `number`, and finally returns the sum of `size` and the count of elements incremented during the recursion.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number `number` and updates the `sequence` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed and appends values accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - After generating the sequence, the code prints its length and the sequence itself.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the construction of the sequence and the assertion checks ensure the sequence is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing `[0]`, which is correct since an array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty increasing subsequence (the element itself).
   - The code handles larger values of `X` by constructing sequences that meet the requirement.

6. **Validation:**
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The assertions within the function help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It constructs arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
