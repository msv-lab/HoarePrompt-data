Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Approach to Generating Increasing Subsequences:**
   - The function `func_1` attempts to generate a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `n`. However, the logic used in `func_1` does not correctly generate such sequences.
   - Specifically, the approach of using powers of 2 to construct the sequence does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is 2 or 3, which require specific constructions.
   - For example, for `X = 2`, the correct answer is `[0]` (one zero), but the program prints `[1]` (one one).

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the sequence in a format that includes spaces between elements, which is fine, but the logic to generate the sequence is flawed.

### Correct Solution Outline:
To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use combinatorial methods to ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the input `X`. This typically involves constructing a sequence where the number of ways to choose elements to form increasing subsequences corresponds to the binomial coefficients or similar combinatorial structures.

Hereâ€™s a more conceptual outline of how you might approach the solution:

1. **Generate Sequence Based on Combinatorial Count:**
   - Use combinatorial mathematics to determine the structure of the sequence that results in exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - For small values of `X`, manually construct the sequence (e.g., `[0]` for `X = 2`, `[0, 1, 0]` for `X = 5`).
   - For larger values, use a combination of smaller sequences to build up to the desired count.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle edge cases like `X = 2, 3, 4` explicitly.
   - Ensure that the sequence length does not exceed 200.

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect and needs significant modifications to address the problem correctly.
