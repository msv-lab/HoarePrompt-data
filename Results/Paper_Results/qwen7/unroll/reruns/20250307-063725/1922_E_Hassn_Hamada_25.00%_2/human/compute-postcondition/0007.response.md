Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).

To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).

The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.

For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.

Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
