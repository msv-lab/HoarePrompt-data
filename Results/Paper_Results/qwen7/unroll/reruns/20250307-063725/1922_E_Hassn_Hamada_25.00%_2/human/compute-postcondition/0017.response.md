Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `number`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, which is a list of integers with each element in the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function returns either 0 or the sum of the length of the list `sequence` and the count of elements in `sequence` that were incremented by their index value.**
