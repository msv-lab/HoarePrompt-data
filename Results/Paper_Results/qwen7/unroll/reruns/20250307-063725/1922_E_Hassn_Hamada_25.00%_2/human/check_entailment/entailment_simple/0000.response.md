Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The solution uses a recursive approach to construct such an array by leveraging the properties of powers of 2.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - **Base Case**: When `number == 0`, the function returns 0. This is correct because when `number` is 0, no elements need to be added to the sequence, and the size of the sequence is 0.
   - **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `(1 << (size + 1)) - 1 <= number`. This ensures that the function finds the largest `size` such that \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1 \leq number\). This is crucial for constructing the sequence correctly.
   - **Appending Elements**: For each `i` in the range `size`, the function appends `i` to the sequence. This step ensures that the sequence has the necessary elements to form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - **Recursive Call**: The function calls itself with `number - (1 << (size + 1)) + 1`. This step is used to handle the remaining part of `number` after accounting for the current `size`.
   - **Incrementing Elements**: The elements in the sequence are incremented based on the result of the recursive call. This ensures that the sequence has the correct number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case and the recursive case.
   - The loop ensures that the sequence is constructed in a way that maximizes the number of increasing subsequences.
   - The recursive call and the incrementing step ensure that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
