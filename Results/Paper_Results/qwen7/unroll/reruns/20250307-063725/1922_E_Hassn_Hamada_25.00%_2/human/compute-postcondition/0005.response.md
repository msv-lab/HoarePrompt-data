Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition:**
   The loop condition is given by:
   \[
   (1 << size + 1) - 1 \leq number
   \]

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - \(1 << size + 1\) means shifting the binary representation of 1 to the left by \(size + 1\) positions.
   - For example, if \(size = 1\), then \(1 << 2 = 4\), and \((1 << 2) - 1 = 3\).
   - If \(size = 2\), then \(1 << 3 = 8\), and \((1 << 3) - 1 = 7\).

3. **Initial Values:**
   - `size` is initially 1.
   - `number` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq number \leq 1000\).
   - `sequence` is a list of integers, but it is not relevant to the loop condition.

4. **Determine the Initial Loop Condition:**
   - When `size` is 1, the condition becomes:
     \[
     (1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = (1 << 2) - 1 = 3
     \]
   - So, the condition is:
     \[
     3 \leq number
     \]

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition \(3 \leq number\) must be true.
   - Given that `number` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, we need to ensure that `number` is at least 3.

### Final Answer:
State: **`size` is 1, `number` must be at least 3**
