Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences, or report that it is impossible. The number of increasing subsequences of an array is related to its length and the values within it.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function aims to generate a sequence of integers such that the total number of increasing subsequences matches the given `number`.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence and ensure the number of increasing subsequences matches the target.
   - The key logic is in the loop that constructs the sequence and the recursive call to handle the remaining part of `number`.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The loop in `func_1` ensures that the sequence is built in such a way that the number of increasing subsequences is maximized using powers of 2.
   - Specifically, the loop runs `size` times, appending the current `size` to the sequence. This creates a pattern where the sequence looks like `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, ...]` up to the current `size`.

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - After building the initial sequence, the function makes a recursive call to handle the remaining part of `number`.
   - The recursive call ensures that the sequence is adjusted to match the exact number of increasing subsequences required.

5. **Final Return**:
   - The function returns the sum of `size` and the count of elements incremented during the recursion, ensuring the total number of increasing subsequences matches the target.

6. **Output Handling**:
   - The main program correctly handles the input and output format, printing the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

Given the detailed analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
