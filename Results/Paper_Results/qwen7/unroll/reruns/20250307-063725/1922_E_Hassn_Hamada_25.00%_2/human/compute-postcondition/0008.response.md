Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `size`.
2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This condition determines when the loop should stop.
3. **Determine the Final Value of `size`**: The loop increments `size` until the condition fails, meaning `(1 << size + 1) - 1 > number`. The final value of `size` just before the loop exits will be the highest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

Given the initial state:
- `number` is a given value.
- `size` is initially set to some value that needs to be determined based on the condition.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to set `size` to the correct initial value such that the loop will eventually exit when the condition fails.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial Value of `size`**: We need to find the highest `size` such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`. This is the value that `size` will take just before the loop exits.
2. **Final State**: The final value of `size` will be the highest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

### Example Calculation:
If `number` is 15:
- For `size = 3`, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15.
- For `size = 4`, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15.

So, the final value of `size` is 3.

### General Case:
For any given `number`, the final value of `size` can be found by:
- Starting with `size = 0` and incrementing `size` until `(1 << size + 1) - 1 > number`.

### Final State:
The final state after the loop will be:
- `size` is the highest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

### Adjusted State:
Since the loop starts with an initial value of `size` and increments it until the condition fails, the initial value of `size` must be set to the correct starting point. For the loop to execute correctly, `size` should be set to the highest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:
**`size` is the highest integer such that `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`**.

This ensures that the loop will run correctly and terminate at the right point.
