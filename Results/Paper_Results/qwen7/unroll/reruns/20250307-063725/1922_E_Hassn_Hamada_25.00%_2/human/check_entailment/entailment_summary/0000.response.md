Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify whether it correctly generates an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences, as per the problem statement.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` and modify the `sequence` list.
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - It calculates the highest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
   - It then appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence` and recursively processes the remaining part of `number`.
   - Finally, it returns the size of the generated sequence plus the count of elements incremented during the recursion.

2. **Main Program**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` to generate the sequence and prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

### Verification:

- **Base Case**: When `number` is 0, the function returns 0, which is correct.
- **Recursive Case**: The function correctly constructs the sequence using a binary representation approach. Each bit position in the binary representation corresponds to an element in the sequence, and the value of the element is determined by the remaining `number`.
- **Incrementing Elements**: The function increments certain elements in the sequence to ensure that the total number of increasing subsequences matches the given `number`.

### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `X = 2`
  - Expected Output: `1 0`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[0]` has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: `[]` and `[0]`.
- **Test Case 2**: `X = 5`
  - Expected Output: `3 0 1 0`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[0, 1, 0]` has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: `[]`, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[0, 1, 0]`.
- **Test Case 3**: `X = 13`
  - Expected Output: `5 2 2 3 4 2`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]` has exactly 13 increasing subsequences.
- **Test Case 4**: `X = 37`
  - Expected Output: `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`
  - Explanation: The sequence `[-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]` has exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

Given the analysis and the provided execution summary, the function `func_1` correctly generates the sequence for the given `number` and the main program correctly processes each test case.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
