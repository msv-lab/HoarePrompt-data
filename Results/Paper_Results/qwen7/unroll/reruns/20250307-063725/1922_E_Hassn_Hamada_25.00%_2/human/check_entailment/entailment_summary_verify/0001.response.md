### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number `number` and updates the `sequence` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed and appends values accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - After generating the sequence, the code prints its length and the sequence itself.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the construction of the sequence and the assertion checks ensure the sequence is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing `[0]`, which is correct since an array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty increasing subsequence (the element itself).
   - The code handles larger values of `X` by constructing sequences that meet the requirement.

6. **Validation:**
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The assertions within the function help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Large Values of `X`:**
  - The function `func_1` constructs sequences using a binary representation approach. This approach assumes that the sequence can be built in a way that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. However, the function does not guarantee that the constructed sequence will always have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`.

- **Assertions and Edge Cases:**
  - The assertions within the function do not cover all edge cases and may not be sufficient to ensure the correctness of the sequence for all possible values of `X`.

- **Potential Infinite Loop:**
  - The loop in `func_1` might not terminate if the value of `number` is not handled correctly, leading to potential infinite loops or incorrect results.

Given these issues, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the code does not guarantee the correct construction of the sequence for all possible values of `X`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
