Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: The value of `size` will be the highest integer such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).

To understand this, let's break down the loop condition: `(1 << size + 1) - 1`. Here, `1 << size + 1` means shifting the binary number 1 left by `size + 1` positions, which is equivalent to \(2^{(size+1)}\). Subtracting 1 from this gives us \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\), which is a number consisting of `size + 2` bits all set to 1 (e.g., for size = 3, it would be 1111 in binary or 15 in decimal).

The loop continues as long as this value is less than or equal to `number`. So, the loop increments `size` until \(2^{(size+1)} - 1\) exceeds `number`.

For example, if `number` is 15, the loop will run as follows:
- Initially, `size` is 1, so `(1 << 1 + 1) - 1 = 3`, which is less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 2.
- Now, `(1 << 2 + 1) - 1 = 7`, which is still less than 15, so `size` is incremented to 3.
- Now, `(1 << 3 + 1) - 1 = 15`, which is equal to 15, so `size` is incremented to 4.
- Now, `(1 << 4 + 1) - 1 = 31`, which is greater than 15, so the loop stops.

Thus, the final value of `size` will be 4 for `number` = 15. In general, the output state will be the highest `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(size):
    sequence.append(i)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
