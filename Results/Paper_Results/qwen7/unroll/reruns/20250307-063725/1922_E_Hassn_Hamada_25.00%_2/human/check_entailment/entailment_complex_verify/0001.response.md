### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number `number` and updates the `sequence` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed and appends values accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - After generating the sequence, the code prints its length and the sequence itself.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the construction of the sequence and the assertion checks ensure the sequence is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing `[0]`, which is correct since an array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty increasing subsequence (the element itself).
   - The code handles larger values of `X` by constructing sequences that meet the requirement.

6. **Validation:**
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The assertions within the function help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the implementation:

- **Incorrect Handling of Large Values of `X`:**
  - The function `func_1` constructs a sequence using a binary representation approach. While this approach is generally correct, it may not always produce the shortest possible sequence for large values of `X`.
  - For instance, consider `X = 37`. The function constructs the sequence `[2, 2, 3, 4, 2]`, which has 5 elements. However, a more optimal sequence could be `[0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]`, which has 7 elements but still satisfies the requirement.

- **Assertions in `func_1`:**
  - The assertions in `func_1` are used to check the validity of the sequence after modifications. However, these assertions do not guarantee that the sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. They only ensure that the sequence is modified correctly.

- **Output Length Constraint:**
  - The problem specifies that the array length should be at most 200. The current implementation does not explicitly enforce this constraint. While the function `func_1` is designed to handle large values of `X`, it may produce sequences longer than 200 elements for very large `X`.

Given these issues, the code does not guarantee that the constructed sequence will always have exactly `X` increasing subsequences, especially for large values of `X`. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

### Conclusion:
The code does not guarantee that the constructed sequence will always have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`. There are cases where the sequence might not meet the requirement due to the limitations of the binary representation approach and the lack of explicit length constraint enforcement.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
