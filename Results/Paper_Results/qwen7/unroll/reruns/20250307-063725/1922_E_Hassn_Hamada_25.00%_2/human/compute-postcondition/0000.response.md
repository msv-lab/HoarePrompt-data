Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000; sequence is a list of integers where each element is in the range [-10^9, 10^9]; the function returns the size of the generated sequence.**

The provided code is a docstring for a function that generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number. However, the actual implementation of the function is missing. The docstring mentions that the function takes two parameters: `number` and `sequence`. It also specifies that the function returns an integer representing the size of the generated sequence. Since no actual code is provided to generate the sequence, the values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged from their initial state. The function's return type is mentioned but no return value is computed in the given snippet.
