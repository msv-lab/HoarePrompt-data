The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and modifies the `sequence` list by incrementing certain elements. If `number` is 0, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the highest integer `size` such that \(2^{(size+1)} - 1 \leq number\), appends a sequence of numbers to `sequence`, recursively processes the remaining part of `number`, and finally returns the sum of `size` and the count of elements incremented during the recursion.
