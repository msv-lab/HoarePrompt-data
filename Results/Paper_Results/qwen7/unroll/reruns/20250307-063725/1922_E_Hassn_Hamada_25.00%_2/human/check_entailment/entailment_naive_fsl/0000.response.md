Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences for all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all values of `X`.

For example, consider the input `X = 37`. The program attempts to generate a sequence that meets this requirement, but it fails to do so correctly. The generated sequence might not always have the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by `X`. The logic within `func_1` does not guarantee that the sequence will have the desired number of increasing subsequences for all possible values of `X`.

To illustrate, let's consider a simpler example where `X = 5`. The correct approach would involve generating a sequence like `[0, 1, 0, 2]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the provided code does not guarantee this behavior for all inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
