### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The array length should be at most 200.
   - If it's impossible to construct such an array, we should print `-1`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1` with `n-1` and an empty list `result`.
   - The function `func_1` generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number `number` and updates the `sequence` list.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function uses a binary representation approach to construct the sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the sequence needed and appends values accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the sequence meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

4. **Checking the Output:**
   - After generating the sequence, the code prints its length and the sequence itself.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the construction of the sequence and the assertion checks ensure the sequence is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 by printing `[0]`, which is correct since an array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty increasing subsequence (the element itself).
   - The code handles larger values of `X` by constructing sequences that meet the requirement.

6. **Validation:**
   - The provided examples match the expected behavior of the code.
   - The assertions within the function help ensure the sequence is constructed correctly.

### Conclusion:
The code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It constructs arrays with the specified number of increasing subsequences and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
