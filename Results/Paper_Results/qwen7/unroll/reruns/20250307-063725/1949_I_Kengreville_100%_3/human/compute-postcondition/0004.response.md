Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes `visited` as a list of length `n` filled with `False`. All other lists (`x`, `y`, `r`) and the variable `coef` remain unchanged from their initial states.
