You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n where each element (x[i], y[i], r[i]) represents the coordinates (x-coordinate, y-coordinate) and radius of the i-th disk respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited during the DFS traversal. coef is a list of floating-point numbers of length n used to store coefficients for the linear equations derived from the tangency conditions.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef = [None] * n
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.
    tot = 0
    bipartite = True
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef[i] = 1
            tot = 0
            bipartite = True
            dfs(i)
            ok = ok or bipartite and tot != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `bipartite` is True, `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with either `1` or `None`; `tot` is an integer that could be any value since it is not specified how `dfs(i)` affects it; `ok` is `True` if at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `bipartite` is True if at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not equal to 0. Otherwise, `bipartite` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, x, y, r, visited, and coef. n is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. x, y, and r are lists of length n representing the coordinates and radius of disks, respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited during a DFS traversal. coef is a list of floating-point numbers storing coefficients for linear equations derived from tangency conditions. The function does not return anything.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
