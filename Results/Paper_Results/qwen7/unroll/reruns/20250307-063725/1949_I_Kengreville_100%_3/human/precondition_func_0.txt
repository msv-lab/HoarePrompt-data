n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n where each element (x[i], y[i], r[i]) represents the coordinates (x-coordinate, y-coordinate) and radius of the i-th disk respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited during the DFS traversal. coef is a list of floating-point numbers of length n used to store coefficients for the linear equations derived from the tangency conditions.
