The function processes a set of disks represented by their coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal on these disks to determine if they can be partitioned into two groups such that no two disks in the same group are tangent to each other. If such a partition exists and at least one group contains more than one disk, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
