Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `tot` is 0; `ok` is False.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ok`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
