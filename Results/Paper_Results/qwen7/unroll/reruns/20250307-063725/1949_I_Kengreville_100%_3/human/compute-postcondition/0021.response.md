Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, x, y, r, visited, and coef. n is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. x, y, and r are lists of length n representing the coordinates and radius of disks, respectively. visited is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited during a DFS traversal. coef is a list of floating-point numbers storing coefficients for linear equations derived from tangency conditions. The function does not return anything.**
