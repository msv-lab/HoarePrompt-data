Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `visited` remains unchanged, `coef` remains unchanged.**

The code `r = [None] * n` initializes `r` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `visited`, or `coef`.
