Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` remains unchanged, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef` remains unchanged.**

The code initializes `y` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `r`, `visited`, or `coef`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
