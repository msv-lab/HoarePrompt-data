Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `coef` as a list of length `n` filled with `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
