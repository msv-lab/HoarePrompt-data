Output State: `bipartite` is True, `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with either `1` or `None`; `tot` is an integer that could be any value since it is not specified how `dfs(i)` affects it; `ok` is `True` if at least one call to `dfs(i)` resulted in `bipartite` being `True` and `tot` not equal to `0`, otherwise `False`.
