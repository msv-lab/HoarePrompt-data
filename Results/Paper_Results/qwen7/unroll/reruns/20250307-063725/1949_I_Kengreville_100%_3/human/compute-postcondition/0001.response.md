Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `y` remains unchanged, `r` remains unchanged, `visited` remains unchanged, `coef` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `x` of length `n` and fills it with `None`. The values of `n`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial states.
