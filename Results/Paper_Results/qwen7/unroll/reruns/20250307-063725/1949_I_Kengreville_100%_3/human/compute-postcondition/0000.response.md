Output State: **`n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n where each element (x[i], y[i], r[i]) represents the coordinates (x-coordinate, y-coordinate) and radius of the i-th disk respectively. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether the i-th disk has been visited during the DFS traversal. coef is a list of floating-point numbers of length n used to store coefficients for the linear equations derived from the tangency conditions.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The values of `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial state. The new value of `n` is determined by the user's input, which is constrained to be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
