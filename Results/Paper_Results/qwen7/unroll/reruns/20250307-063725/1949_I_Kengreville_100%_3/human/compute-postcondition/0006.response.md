Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - The variable `n` is an input integer with the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\).

3. **Check the constraints and initial conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
   - The value of `i` will start as 0 in the first iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute, we need to ensure `n` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` will be 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be at least 1.
- `i` must be 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
