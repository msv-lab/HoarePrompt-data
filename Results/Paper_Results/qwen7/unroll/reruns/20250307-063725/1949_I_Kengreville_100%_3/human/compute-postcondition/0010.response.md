Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `n` is an input integer, 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000; `x` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `y` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `r` is a list of length `n` filled with integers; `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`; `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`; `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables retain their initial states.
