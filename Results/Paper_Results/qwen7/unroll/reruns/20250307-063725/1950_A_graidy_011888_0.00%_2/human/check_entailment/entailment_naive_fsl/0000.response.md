Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program generates random test cases and prints the result for each case, but it does not actually solve the problem as described. The program should take input from the user or stdin, but instead, it generates random numbers and prints them along with a random result. This means it does not meet the requirement of processing the input as specified in the problem description. Specifically, it does not read the number of test cases or process individual test cases where the input is provided. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
