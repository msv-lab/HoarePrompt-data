Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

# Annotated Program:
from random import randint

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.

    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements separated by spaces: three integers (x, y, z) generated randomly between 1 and 9, and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
    #
    #For each line, the first two integers (x and y) are compared. If x is less than y, then y is compared with z:
    #- If y is greater than z, the result is 'peak'.
    #- If y is less than z, the result is 'stair'.
    #- If y is equal to z, the result is 'none'.
    #
    #If x is not less than y (i.e., x is greater than or equal to y), the result is always 'none'.
    #
    #The loop runs 1000 times, so there will be 1000 such lines printed, each describing the outcome of the random comparison for that iteration.
