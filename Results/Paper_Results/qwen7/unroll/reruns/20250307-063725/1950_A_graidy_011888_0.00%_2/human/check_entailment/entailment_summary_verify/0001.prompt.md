You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the string is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the string is 'stair'; otherwise, the string is 'none'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to classify three given digits as forming a "stair", "peak", or "none" based on specific conditions.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program generates random digits `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and prints them.
   - It then determines the result based on the conditions for "stair" and "peak".
   - However, the program does not read input from the user; instead, it generates random numbers and prints results without any input or output according to the problem statement.
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The program should take input for the number of test cases and then for each test case, take three digits as input.
   - Based on these digits, it should determine whether they form a "stair", "peak", or "none".
4. **Actual Behavior**:
   - The program generates and prints random digits and their classification, which does not match the expected behavior of reading and processing input according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. It generates random numbers and prints results without taking any input from the user.

### Correctness:
**False**

Correctness: False
