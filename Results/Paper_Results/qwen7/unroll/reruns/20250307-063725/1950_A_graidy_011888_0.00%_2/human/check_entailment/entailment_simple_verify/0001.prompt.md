You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:

        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        
        print(res)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements separated by spaces: three integers (x, y, z) generated randomly between 1 and 9, and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none') based on the conditions provided in the loop body.
    #
    #For each line, the first two integers (x and y) are compared. If x is less than y, then y is compared with z:
    #- If y is greater than z, the result is 'peak'.
    #- If y is less than z, the result is 'stair'.
    #- If y is equal to z, the result is 'none'.
    #
    #If x is not less than y (i.e., x is greater than or equal to y), the result is always 'none'.
    #
    #The loop runs 1000 times, so there will be 1000 such lines printed, each describing the outcome of the random comparison for that iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to classify three given digits as forming a "stair", "peak", or "none" based on specific conditions.
2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The provided program generates random digits `x`, `y`, and `z` between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and prints them.
   - It then determines the result based on the conditions for "stair" and "peak".
   - However, the program does not read input from the user; instead, it generates random numbers and prints results without any input or output according to the problem statement.
3. **Expected Behavior**:
   - The program should take input for the number of test cases and then for each test case, take three digits as input.
   - Based on these digits, it should determine whether they form a "stair", "peak", or "none".
4. **Actual Behavior**:
   - The program generates and prints random digits and their classification, which does not match the expected behavior of reading and processing input according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution as per the problem description. It generates random numbers and prints results without taking any input from the user.

### Correctness:
**False**

Correctness: False
