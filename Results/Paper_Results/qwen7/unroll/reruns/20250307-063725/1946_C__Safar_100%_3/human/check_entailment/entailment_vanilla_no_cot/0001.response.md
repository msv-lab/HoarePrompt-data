### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The program correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - The goal is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing \( k \) edges, each connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum \( x \)**:
   - The program uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \). The range for \( x \) is from 1 to \( n // k \).
   - The function `check` is used to verify if a given \( x \) is feasible by checking if we can remove \( k \) edges such that no connected component has fewer than \( x \) vertices.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree.
   - It keeps track of the size of the largest subtree rooted at each node and ensures that no subtree has fewer than \( x \) vertices.
   - If the condition is met, it increments the count of components that satisfy the requirement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the root node (1) might have a subtree size greater than or equal to \( x \).
   - It correctly checks if the root node itself forms a valid component and if the total number of components equals \( k \).

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of the binary search, which is the maximum \( x \) found.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` and `check` functions appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements.
- The binary search approach is appropriate for finding the maximum \( x \).
- The DFS implementation in `check` correctly verifies the feasibility of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
