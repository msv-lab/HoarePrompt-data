Reasoning:
1. **Tree Representation**: The program correctly constructs the adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.
2. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is set up to find the maximum value `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and have each remaining connected component of size at least `x`.
3. **Check Function**: The `check` function correctly checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices. It uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore the tree and count the number of components that meet the size requirement.
4. **Binary Search Execution**: The binary search iteratively narrows down the possible values of `x` until it finds the maximum value that satisfies the condition.
5. **Output**: The program prints the result of the binary search, which is the maximum value `x`.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program logic appears to be correct. The binary search and DFS functions are implemented appropriately to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **True**
