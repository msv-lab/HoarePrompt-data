Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the functions `func_1` and `check` correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Tree Representation**: The function `func_1` correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the input edges. This is essential for any further analysis of the tree structure.

2. **Binary Search**: The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the maximum value `r` such that removing `k` edges results in at least `r` connected components where each component has at least `r` vertices. This is the core logic for solving the problem.

3. **Check Function**: The `check` function is designed to verify if the current guess `A` (which is the lower bound of the binary search) can result in the required number of connected components (`k`) where each component has at least `A` vertices. The function uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree and count the number of components that meet the size requirement. It also ensures that the total number of components is at least `k`.

Given the problem constraints and the provided functions:
- The binary search in `func_1` is correctly set up to find the maximum value `r`.
- The `check` function correctly counts the number of components and verifies their sizes.

Since both functions work together to implement the correct algorithm for finding the maximum number `x`, the program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
