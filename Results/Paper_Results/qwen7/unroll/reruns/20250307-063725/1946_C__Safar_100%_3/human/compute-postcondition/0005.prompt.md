Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `r` is 0, `stack` contains the tuple (1, 1), A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, the variable `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where `g[x]` is a list of nodes connected to node `x`, `visited` is an empty set, `d` is a dictionary containing the key-value pair {(1): 1}
Code of the loop:
while True:
    x, p = stack[-1]
    if x not in visited:
        visited.add(x)
        d[x] = 1
        for node in g[x]:
            if node != p:
                stack.append((node, x))
    else:
        if x == 1:
            break
        if d[x] >= A:
            r += 1
        else:
            d[p] += d[x]
        stack.pop()
        visited.remove(x)
        del d[x]



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
