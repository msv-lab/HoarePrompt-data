Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. Then, it performs a binary search to find a value `r` such that when `k` edges are removed, the resulting tree has at least `r` connected components. Finally, it prints the value of `r`.**
