#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, k is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and edges is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: Output State: `g` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is a list. For each edge `(a, b)` in `edges`, both `g[a]` and `g[b]` contain the other vertex of the edge. In other words, `g` represents an adjacency list of a tree with `n` vertices, and each vertex points to all its adjacent vertices.

    l = 1

    while l <= r:

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of vertices), `k` (the number of edges to be removed), and `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges in the tree). It constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. Then, it performs a binary search to find a value `r` such that when `k` edges are removed, the resulting tree has at least `r` connected components. Finally, it prints the value of `r`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The variable g is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where g[x] is a list of nodes connected to node x.
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {(1): 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        x, p = stack[-1]
        
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]
        
    #State: r is 2, stack is empty, visited contains {1}, d contains {(1): 1}
    if (r > k or d[1] >= A and r == k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: r is 2, stack is empty, visited contains {1}, d contains {(1): 1}, and the condition (r > k or (d[1] >= A and r == k)) is false
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `A` and an adjacency list `g` representing a tree. It checks if, after performing operations to remove edges and analyze the resulting connected components, all remaining components have a size of at least `A`. If all components meet this condition, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
