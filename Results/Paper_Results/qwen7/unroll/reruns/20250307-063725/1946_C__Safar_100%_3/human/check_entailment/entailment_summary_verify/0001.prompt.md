You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        g[b].append(a)
    c = 0

    l = 1
    r = n // k
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
    print(r)

#Function 2:
def check(A):
    stack = [(1, 1)]
    visited = set()
    d = {1: 1}
    r = 0
    while True:
        (x, p) = stack[-1]
        if x not in visited:
            visited.add(x)
            d[x] = 1
            for node in g[x]:
                if node != p:
                    stack.append((node, x))
        else:
            if x == 1:
                break
            if d[x] >= A:
                r += 1
            else:
                d[p] += d[x]
            stack.pop()
            visited.remove(x)
            del d[x]

        return True
    return False



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts an integer `A` and an adjacency list `g` representing a tree. It checks if, after performing operations to remove edges and analyze the resulting connected components, all remaining components have a size of at least `A`. If all components meet this condition, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It then uses binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The `check` function is used to verify if a given `A` (which represents the minimum size of each connected component) is feasible.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is performed between `l = 1` and `r = n // k`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a feasible solution, so we move the lower bound `l` up to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we move the upper bound `r` down to `mid - 1`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree.
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree (`d`) and whether the subtree can be considered a separate component (`r`).
   - If `r > k` (more than `k` components), or if the largest component is at least `A` and exactly `k` components are formed, the function returns `True`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the entire tree forms one component and needs to be split into smaller components.
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is found efficiently within the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result of the binary search is printed, which is the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each connected component has at least `x` vertices. The binary search and DFS implementation are appropriate and handle the problem constraints effectively.

Correctness: **True**
