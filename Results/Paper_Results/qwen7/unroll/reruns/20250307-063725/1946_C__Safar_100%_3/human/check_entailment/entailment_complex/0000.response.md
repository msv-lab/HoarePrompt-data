Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: 
   - This function correctly constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.
   - It then performs a binary search to find the maximum value `r` such that after removing `k` edges, the tree splits into at least `r` connected components, each having at least `r` vertices.
   - The `check` function is used within the binary search to validate whether a given size `mid` can result in at least `k` components of size at least `mid`.

2. **Function 2 (`check`)**:
   - This function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree and count the number of connected components that have at least the specified size `A`.
   - It correctly updates the sizes of components and ensures that the conditions for the number of components and their sizes are met.
   - The function returns `True` if the conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise.

Given that:
- The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum `r` using binary search and the `check` function.
- The `check` function correctly validates the conditions for the number of components and their sizes.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
