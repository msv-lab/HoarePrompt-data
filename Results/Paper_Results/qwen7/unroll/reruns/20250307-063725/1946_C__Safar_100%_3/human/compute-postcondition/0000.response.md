Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, the variable `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where `g[x]` is a list of nodes connected to node `x`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a stack with a single tuple `(1, 1)`. The other variables (`A` and `g`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
