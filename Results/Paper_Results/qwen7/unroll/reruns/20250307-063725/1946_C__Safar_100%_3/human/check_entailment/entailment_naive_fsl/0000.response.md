Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `check` function does not accurately determine whether it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has at least `A` vertices.

### Issues in the Code:
1. **Incorrect Logic in `check` Function**: The `check` function attempts to validate if a given value `A` works by using a depth-first search (DFS) approach. However, the logic for counting the number of connected components and ensuring each component has at least `A` vertices is flawed. The function does not properly account for the removal of edges and the resulting sizes of the connected components.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For instance, consider a tree where removing a specific edge results in a large connected component and smaller ones. The current implementation may not correctly identify such scenarios.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in `func_1` is intended to find the maximum value `x`. However, the `check` function's logic does not correctly validate the conditions for each midpoint value `mid`.

### Example where the Program Fails:
Consider the following input:
- `n = 5`, `k = 1`
- Edges: `(1, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)`

The correct answer should be `2` because after removing the edge `(1, 3)`, we get two connected components: `{1, 2}` and `{3, 4, 5}`, both of which have at least `2` vertices. However, the provided program may fail to correctly identify this scenario due to the flawed logic in the `check` function.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
