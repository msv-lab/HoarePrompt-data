The function `check` accepts a parameter `A`. `A` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges. The function also uses an adjacency list representation of the tree, where `g[x]` is a list of nodes connected to node `x`. The function returns either `True` or `False`.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `A` and an adjacency list `g` representing a tree. It checks if, after removing k edges, all remaining connected components have a size of at least `A`. If all components meet this condition, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
