Output State: **`stack` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`, A is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing k edges, the variable `g` is an adjacency list representation of the tree, where `g[x]` is a list of nodes connected to node `x`, `visited` is an empty set.**

The code initializes an empty set named `visited`. This does not affect the values of `stack`, `A`, or `g`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `visited` is updated to an empty set.
