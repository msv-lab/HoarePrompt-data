### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It then uses binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The `check` function is used to verify if a given `A` (which represents the minimum size of each connected component) is feasible.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is performed between `l = 1` and `r = n // k`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a feasible solution, so we move the lower bound `l` up to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we move the upper bound `r` down to `mid - 1`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree.
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree (`d`) and whether the subtree can be considered a separate component (`r`).
   - If `r > k` (more than `k` components), or if the largest component is at least `A` and exactly `k` components are formed, the function returns `True`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the entire tree forms one component and needs to be split into smaller components.
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is found efficiently within the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result of the binary search is printed, which is the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each connected component has at least `x` vertices. The binary search and DFS implementation are appropriate and handle the problem constraints effectively.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
