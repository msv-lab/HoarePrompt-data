### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Edge Removal**:
   - The function `func_1` constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree.
   - It then uses binary search to find the maximum value `x` such that after removing `k` edges, each connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The `check` function is used to verify if a given `A` (which represents the minimum size of each connected component) is feasible.

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is performed between `l = 1` and `r = n // k`.
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `l + (r - l) // 2`.
   - If `check(mid)` returns `True`, it means `mid` is a feasible solution, so we move the lower bound `l` up to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we move the upper bound `r` down to `mid - 1`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - The `check` function performs a depth-first search (DFS) to explore the tree.
   - It keeps track of the size of each subtree (`d`) and whether the subtree can be considered a separate component (`r`).
   - If `r > k` (more than `k` components), or if the largest component is at least `A` and exactly `k` components are formed, the function returns `True`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where the entire tree forms one component and needs to be split into smaller components.
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is found efficiently within the constraints.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result of the binary search is printed, which is the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.

Upon closer inspection, there are a few issues with the provided code and the original assessment:

- **Incorrect Handling of Components**: The `check` function does not correctly count the number of components. Specifically, the logic inside the `while` loop for checking the size of components is flawed. The `d` dictionary is updated incorrectly, leading to incorrect counts of component sizes.
- **Incorrect Return Value**: The `check` function should return `True` only when the number of components is exactly `k` and the largest component is at least `A`. However, the current implementation does not ensure this.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The edge case where the entire tree needs to be split into smaller components is not handled correctly due to the flawed counting mechanism.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Counting Components**:
   - The `check` function should use a more robust method to count the number of components and their sizes. The current approach using `d` and `stack` is incorrect because it does not properly track the sizes of components.

2. **Correcting the `check` Function**:
   - We need to modify the `check` function to correctly count the number of components and their sizes.
   - We should use a separate counter to keep track of the number of components and another counter to keep track of the size of the largest component.

### Corrected `check` Function:

```python
def check(A):
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    components = 0
    max_component_size = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if not visited[i]:
            stack = [(i, 1)]  # (node, parent)
            component_size = 0
            while stack:
                node, parent = stack.pop()
                if not visited[node]:
                    visited[node] = True
                    component_size += 1
                    for neighbor in g[node]:
                        if neighbor != parent:
                            stack.append((neighbor, node))
            if component_size >= A:
                components += 1
                max_component_size = max(max_component_size, component_size)
    return components == k + 1 and max_component_size >= A
```

### Final Evaluation:

Given the issues identified in the original code, particularly the flawed counting mechanism in the `check` function, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

**Final: False**
