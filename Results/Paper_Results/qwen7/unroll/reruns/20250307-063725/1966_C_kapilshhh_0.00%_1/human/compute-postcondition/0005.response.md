Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It sorts this list in descending order, adds a zero at the end, and checks a specific condition using dynamic programming. If the condition is met, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob". This process repeats for each test case. The function does not return any value but prints "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case.**
