Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.** 

Explanation: The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. The other variables and their initial states remain unaffected.
