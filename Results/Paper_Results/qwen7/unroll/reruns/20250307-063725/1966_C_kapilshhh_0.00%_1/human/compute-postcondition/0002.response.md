Output State: The output state will be a series of "Alice" or "Alice" printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `tc`.

Explanation: The loop runs `tc` times. In each iteration, it reads two lines of input. The first line is an integer `n`, which is ignored in the code. The second line is a space-separated list of integers. These integers are processed to form a list `arr` where duplicates are removed and the list is sorted in descending order with an additional `0` appended at the end. Then, a boolean variable `dp` is set to `True`. A loop iterates through `arr` starting from the second element, checking if the difference between consecutive elements (or the last element and `0`) is greater than 1 or if `dp` is `False`. If the condition is met, `dp` remains `True`; otherwise, it becomes `False`. Finally, "Alice" is printed if `dp` is still `True` after the loop, or "Alice" is printed if `dp` is `False`. This process repeats `tc` times, so the output will consist of `tc` lines, each containing "Alice".
