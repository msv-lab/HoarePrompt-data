Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly determining the winner of the game:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `dp` Calculation**: 
   - The logic for calculating `dp` is flawed. The variable `dp` is supposed to represent whether the current player can force a win, but the calculation `arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp` does not accurately reflect the game's rules.
   
2. **Redundant `dp` Variable**:
   - The `dp` variable is not necessary for solving this problem. Instead, we can directly determine the winner based on the properties of the game.

3. **Incorrect Final Output**:
   - The final output for each test case is always "Alice", regardless of the input. This indicates that the logic inside the loop is not properly implemented.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to use the concept of Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of all pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Alice")
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the number of piles and the sizes of the piles.
3. Compute the Nim-sum of the pile sizes.
4. Determine the winner based on the Nim-sum:
   - If the Nim-sum is zero, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.
