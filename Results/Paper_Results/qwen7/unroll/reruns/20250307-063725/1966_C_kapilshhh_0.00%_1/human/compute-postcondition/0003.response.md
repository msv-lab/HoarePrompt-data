Output State: The output state will be a series of strings either "Alice" or "Bob" based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `tc`.

Explanation: For each value of `tc`, the loop processes an input integer `n` and a list of integers. It then sorts this list in descending order, adds a zero at the end, and checks a condition using dynamic programming (`dp`). If the condition is met, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob". This process repeats until `tc` becomes 0. Therefore, the final output state will consist of "Alice" or "Bob" printed for each iteration of `tc`.
