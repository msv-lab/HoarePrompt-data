You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the initial number of stones in each pile. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [
            0]
        
        dp = True
        
        n = len(arr) - 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
        
        tc -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of strings either "Alice" or "Bob" based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `tc`.
    #
    #Explanation: For each value of `tc`, the loop processes an input integer `n` and a list of integers. It then sorts this list in descending order, adds a zero at the end, and checks a condition using dynamic programming (`dp`). If the condition is met, it prints "Alice"; otherwise, it prints "Bob". This process repeats until `tc` becomes 0. Therefore, the final output state will consist of "Alice" or "Bob" printed for each iteration of `tc`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns a result for each group based on the given data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
