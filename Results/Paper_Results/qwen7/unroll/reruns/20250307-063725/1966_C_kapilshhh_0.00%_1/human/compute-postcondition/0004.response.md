Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) representing the initial number of stones in each pile. The function returns a result for each group based on the given data.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instructions.
