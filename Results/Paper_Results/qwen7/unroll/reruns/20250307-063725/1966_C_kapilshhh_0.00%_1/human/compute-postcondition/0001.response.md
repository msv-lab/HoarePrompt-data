Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `tc`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `tc > 0`.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `tc` is an input integer.
   - The initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Given that `tc` is an input integer, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `tc` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect this requirement.

**State: **`tc` must be greater than 0**
