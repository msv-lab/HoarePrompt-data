Output State: **`q` is a deque object containing the element `ver`, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `chosen_vertices` is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `vis[ver]` is set to 1.**

The code sets `vis[ver]` to 1, indicating that the vertex `ver` has been visited. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
