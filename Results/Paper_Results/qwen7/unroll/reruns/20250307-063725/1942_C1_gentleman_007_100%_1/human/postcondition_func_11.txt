The function accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are their corresponding powers in the factorization of `num`. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of `num` and its value is the number of times this prime factor divides `num` completely. The `Prime_array` dictionary remains unchanged, and `num` is reduced to 1 after all iterations.
