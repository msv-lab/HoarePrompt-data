The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list `l` containing `n+1` lists. Each index `i` from `0` to `n` in the list `l` corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of vertices that are connected to vertex `i`. Connections are bidirectional, meaning if vertex `y` is connected to vertex `x`, then vertex `x` is also connected to vertex `y`.
