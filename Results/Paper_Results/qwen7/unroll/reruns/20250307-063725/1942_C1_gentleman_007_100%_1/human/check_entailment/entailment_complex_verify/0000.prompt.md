You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

    #- Inside the loop, if `b` is odd (`b & 1`), `ans` is updated to `ans * a % mod`.
    #- Then, `a` is squared and reduced modulo `mod` (`a = a * a % mod`).
    #- Finally, `b` is right-shifted by one bit (`b >>= 1`), effectively dividing `b` by 2.
    #
    #After all iterations, `ans` will be equal to `b^a % mod`. This is because the loop essentially calculates `b^a` through repeated squaring and multiplication only when the corresponding bit in `b` is set (i.e., when `b` is odd).

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `a` (an integer), `b` (a non-negative integer), and `mod` (a positive integer). It returns the result of `b^a % mod` using fast exponentiation. After executing, the program sets `ans` to the value of `b^a % mod` and returns this value.

    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1

    #State: i = 0, j = 0, l = [list of characters forming the LCS of a and the string representation of b].
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the reversed string 's' which is formed by joining all elements in list 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters and a list `b` of integers. It calculates the longest common subsequence (LCS) between string `a` and the string representation of list `b`. After finding the LCS, it reverses the sequence and returns it as a string.

#Function 23:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen, and the length of arr is equal to x.
def func_23(arr):

    for i in arr:
        pos = bisect_left(l, i)
        
        if pos == len(l):
            l.append(i)
        else:

    #State: Output State: `l` is a sorted list of the unique integers from the original list `arr`.
    return len(l)
    #The program returns the length of the sorted list of unique integers from the original list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_23` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the length of a new list containing the unique integers from `arr`, sorted in ascending order.

#Function 24:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: ver is an integer representing a vertex of the polygon, and graph is a dictionary where keys are vertices and values are lists of adjacent vertices. The variable vis is a list or array of boolean values indicating whether each vertex has been visited, with the same length as the number of vertices in the polygon.
def func_24(ver):
    stack = []
    stack.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(stack):
        ver = stack.pop()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                stack.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The output state will be a sequence of vertices printed in the order they were visited during the depth-first search traversal. The exact sequence depends on the structure of the graph and which vertex was initially popped from the stack ('ver'). If the graph is fully connected and starts from 'ver', it will print all vertices in a specific order determined by the adjacency list and the stack operations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a polygon represented by a graph. It starts from a given vertex and visits all reachable vertices, printing each vertex in the order they are visited. The function modifies the `vis` list to mark vertices as visited and uses a stack to keep track of vertices to visit next. If the starting vertex is unvisited, it marks it as visited and continues the traversal. If the starting vertex is already visited, no further action is taken for that vertex.

#Function 25:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_25` does not seem to relate to the problem description at all. It appears to be a breadth-first search (BFS) function that prints the order in which vertices are visited. However, the problem requires a solution to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the problem description and the variables in the function signature, we need to focus on the input variables and their relationships. Here's the relevant information extracted:

### Problem Description
Bessie has a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, and she has already chosen \( x \) vertices. You need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to \( y \) additional vertices. Note that \( y = 0 \) in this version of the problem.

### Function Signature
```python
def func(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    # Implementation details are missing, but we need to focus on the input variables
    pass
```

### Precondition
**n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, where y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

### Precondition
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer such that y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

Combining these, the final precondition is:
```
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
```
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The output state will be a space-separated sequence of integers representing all the vertices in the graph that are reachable from the starting vertex `ver`, including `ver` itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, `x` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is fixed at 0, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to print the order of vertices reachable from the starting vertex, but it does not calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Instead, it returns the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices, which is 0 since `y` is always 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem description. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a polygon. However, the program includes a large number of utility functions and does not define a main function to solve the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case where we have a polygon with 8 sides (`n=8`), and Bessie has chosen vertices `1, 6, 2, 5`. According to the problem, the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed is 2. However, the provided program does not implement any logic to calculate this value.

Here is a potential issue:
- The program does not have a function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed from the given vertices.
- It does not handle the logic to ensure that the chosen vertices form non-intersecting diagonals and maximize the number of triangles.

Since the program does not contain any logic to solve the given problem, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
