Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, `x` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is fixed at 0, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to print the order of vertices reachable from the starting vertex, but it does not calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Instead, it returns the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices, which is 0 since `y` is always 0.**
