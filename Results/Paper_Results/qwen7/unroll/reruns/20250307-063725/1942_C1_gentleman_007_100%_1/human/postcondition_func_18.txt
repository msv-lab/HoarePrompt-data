The function accepts two parameters: `p`, a list of integers representing chosen vertices, and `x`, an integer representing the target vertex. The length of `p` is equal to `x`. It searches for the largest value in `p` that is less than or equal to `x`. If `x` is found in `p`, it returns the length of `p` (`n`). Otherwise, it returns the index `mid` such that `p[mid]` is the largest value less than or equal to `x`.
