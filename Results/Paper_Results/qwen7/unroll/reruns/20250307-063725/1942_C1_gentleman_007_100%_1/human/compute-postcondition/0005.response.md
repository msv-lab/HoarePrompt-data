Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5). `y` is an integer with a fixed value of 0. `chosen_vertices` is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to y additional vertices.**
