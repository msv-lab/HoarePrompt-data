Output State: **n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer such that y = 0, chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, q is a deque object.**

The given code initializes a deque object `q`. Since no operations are performed on the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, or `chosen_vertices`, their values remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `q`, which is initialized as a deque object.
