The function `func_6` takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices chosen by Bessie. It returns a square matrix `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1). Each element `l[x][y]` (and consequently `l[y][x]`) in the matrix is set to 1 if vertices `x` and `y` were chosen by Bessie at least once during the `m` iterations of the loop. All other elements in the matrix remain 0.
