Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Proof Geometric Construction Can Solve All Love Affairs -
manbo-p](https://soundcloud.com/alice-law-314125270/manbo-p-proof-geometric-
construction-can-solve-all-love-affairs)

⠀

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of sides of the polygon), `m` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices). After executing, it returns a nested list where each of the `n` lists contains `m` elements, and each element in these lists is a list identical to `v`.

        l[y].append(x)
    return l
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. It returns a list `l` containing `n+1` lists. Each index `i` from `0` to `n` in the list `l` corresponds to a vertex and contains a list of vertices that are connected to vertex `i`. Connections are bidirectional, meaning if vertex `y` is connected to vertex `x`, then vertex `x` is also connected to vertex `y`.

 Output hints for function6:  The function `func_6` takes two parameters, `n` and `m`, where `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon and `m` represents the number of vertices chosen by Bessie. It returns a square matrix `l` of size (n+1) x (n+1). Each element `l[x][y]` (and consequently `l[y][x]`) in the matrix is set to 1 if vertices `x` and `y` were chosen by Bessie at least once during the `m` iterations of the loop.

    return p
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a 2D list `l` of integers. It returns a 2D list `p` of dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where each element `p[i][j]` (for `i` from 1 to `n` and `j` from 1 to `m`) contains the sum of all elements in the submatrix `l[0...i-1][0...j-1]`, and the first row and first column of `p` are all zeros.
Function number 9 :

''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts an integer x, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5). It calculates the maximum value between 1 - (x & x - 1) and 0, and always returns 0.
Function number 10 :

''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns a list `p` containing boolean values. Each element in the list corresponds to a number from 0 to `num`, where `True` indicates that the number is prime and `False` indicates that it is composite. Additionally, the function populates two auxiliary lists, `Lowest_Prime` and `Highest_Prime`, which store the smallest and largest prime factors for each number, respectively, but these lists are not returned.

''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts two parameters: `num`, a positive integer, and `Prime_array`, a dictionary where keys are prime numbers and values are their corresponding powers in the factorization of `num`. It returns a dictionary `d` where each key is a prime factor of `num` and its value is the number of times this prime factor divides `num` completely. The `Prime_array` dictionary remains unchanged, and `num` is reduced to 1 after all iterations.
Function number 13 :
 Code:

 Output hints for function13:  Functionality: The function accepts an integer `n` representing a number and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the count of each prime factor in the dictionary is incremented by 1. If `n` is not greater than 1, the dictionary remains unchanged.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(d):
    s = 0
    for i in d:
        s += pow(i, d[i] - 1) * (i - 1)
    return s
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the keys are integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie, and the values are the number of times each vertex appears (which should be 1 since the vertices are distinct). It calculates the sum of each key in the dictionary raised to the power of 0 (since `d[i]` is always 1, `d[i] - 1` is 0) multiplied by (`i - 1`). Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the function returns the sum of `i - 1` for all keys in `d`, which ultimately results in 0.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15(n, mod):

 Output hints for function15:  The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 4 and \(10^9\)) and `mod` (an integer). It computes and returns a list `f` containing the factorials of all integers from 1 to `n`, each element in the list being computed modulo `mod`.

''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function `func_16` accepts two parameters, `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr` that starts with `[1, 0]`. Depending on the value of `mod`, the function calculates and appends subsequent elements to `dearr`. If `mod` is `-1`, each element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`. If `mod` is a positive integer, each element is calculated using the formula `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n+1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the list `dearr` with the specified elements.

 Output hints for function25:  The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, `x` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is fixed at 0, and `chosen_vertices` is a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to print the order of vertices reachable from the starting vertex, but it does not calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake. Instead, it returns the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to `y` additional vertices, which is 0 since `y` is always 0.
