The function `func_16` accepts two parameters: `n` and `mod`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, and `mod` is an integer that can either be `-1` or a positive integer. The function returns a list `dearr` that starts with `[1, 0]` and is filled based on the value of `mod`. If `mod == -1`, each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`. Otherwise, elements are calculated as `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n+1`.
