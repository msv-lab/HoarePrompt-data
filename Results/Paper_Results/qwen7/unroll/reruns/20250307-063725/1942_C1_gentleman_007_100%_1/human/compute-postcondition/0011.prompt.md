You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, b is a list of integers where each integer is from 1 to the length of a, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen in the polygon cake problem. The length of b is equal to x, and y is 0.
def func_22(a, b):
    dp = [([0] * (len(b) + 1)) for _ in range(len(a) + 1)]
    for i in range(1, len(a) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            if a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: a is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, b is a list of integers where each integer is from 1 to the length of a, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen in the polygon cake problem, the length of b is equal to x, y is 0, dp is a 2D list with dimensions (len(a) + 1) x (len(b) + 1), where each element is filled based on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between string a and list b converted to a string, considering the LCS length at each position (i, j).
    i, j = len(a), len(b)
    l = []
    while i != 0 and j != 0:
        if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
            j -= 1
        elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
            i -= 1
        else:
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
            l.append(a[i])
        
    #State: i = 0, j = 0, l = [list of characters forming the LCS of a and the string representation of b].
    s = ''.join(l)
    return s[::-1]
    #The program returns the reversed string 's' which is formed by joining all elements in list 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: a string `a` consisting of lowercase English letters, and a list `b` of integers. The list `b` represents the vertices Bessie has chosen in the polygon cake problem. The function returns the reversed string `s` formed by joining all elements in list `b`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the reversed string 's' which is formed by joining all elements in list 'l'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
