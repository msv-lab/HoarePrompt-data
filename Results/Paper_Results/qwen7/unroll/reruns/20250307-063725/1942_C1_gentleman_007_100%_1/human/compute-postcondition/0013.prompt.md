You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen. It is given that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and y = 0.
def func_16(n, mod):
    if (mod == -1) :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]))
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen with a current value of 0, `dearr` is a list containing `[1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 14, ...]` (where the length of the list is `n+1` and each element follows the given recurrence relation).
        #
        #In the output state, the list `dearr` will contain `n+1` elements starting from `[1, 0]`, and each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`.
    else :
        dearr = [1, 0]
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            dearr.append((i - 1) % mod * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2]) % mod % mod)
            
        #State: Output State: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and `y` is 0, `dearr` is a list containing `[1, 0] + [(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod for i in range(3, n+1)]`.
        #
        #In this output state, the list `dearr` is extended with new elements calculated within the loop. Each new element is computed as `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` ranging from 3 to `n+1`. The initial elements of `dearr` remain `[1, 0]`.
    #State: `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, `y` is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices that can be chosen with a current value of 0, and `dearr` is a list. If `mod == -1`, then `dearr` contains `n+1` elements starting from `[1, 0]`, and each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`. Otherwise, `dearr` is extended with new elements calculated within the loop, where each new element is computed as `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n+1`. The initial elements of `dearr` remain `[1, 0]`.
    return dearr
    #The program returns a list `dearr` which starts with [1, 0] and is filled according to the given conditions based on the value of `mod`. If `mod == -1`, each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`. Otherwise, elements are calculated as `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n+1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n` and `mod`. It returns a list `dearr` starting with [1, 0], where each subsequent element is calculated based on the value of `mod`. If `mod == -1`, elements are calculated using `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` from `2` to `n`. If `mod` is a positive integer, elements are calculated using `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` from `3` to `n+1`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `dearr` which starts with [1, 0] and is filled according to the given conditions based on the value of `mod`. If `mod == -1`, each subsequent element is calculated using the formula `(i - 1) * (dearr[i - 1] + dearr[i - 2])` for `i` ranging from `2` to `n`. Otherwise, elements are calculated as `(i-1) % mod * (dearr[i-1] + dearr[i-2]) % mod % mod` for `i` ranging from `3` to `n+1`.
