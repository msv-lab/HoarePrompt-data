### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with `n` sides, where `x` vertices are already chosen by Bessie and `y` additional vertices can be chosen. Since `y = 0`, no additional vertices can be chosen.

2. **Key Insight**: For a polygon with `n` sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `n - 2`. This is because any polygon with `n` sides can be triangulated into `n - 2` triangles.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes numerous utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.), but none of these functions are relevant to solving the problem directly.
   - There is no function that calculates the number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed from the given vertices.

4. **Solution Approach**:
   - Given `n` and `x` vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is always `n - 2`.
   - Since `y = 0`, the number of additional vertices that can be chosen is zero, so the number of triangles remains `n - 2`.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We need a simple function that takes `n` and `x` as inputs and returns `n - 2` as the result.

### Conclusion:

The given code does not implement the solution correctly. It includes many unnecessary functions and does not provide a direct way to calculate the number of non-intersecting triangles. Therefore, the provided code cannot solve the problem as stated.

**Correctness: **False**
