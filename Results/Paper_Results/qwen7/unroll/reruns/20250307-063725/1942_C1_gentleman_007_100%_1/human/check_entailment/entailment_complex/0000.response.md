Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to \( y \) additional vertices from a polygon with \( n \) sides, where \( y = 0 \). Given that \( y = 0 \), no additional vertices can be chosen, so the maximum number of triangular pieces is solely dependent on the vertices Bessie has already chosen.

Let's analyze the provided code and the logic behind the solution:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly parses the input to extract \( n \), \( x \), and the list of chosen vertices.
   
2. **Initial Calculation**:
   - The program initializes the answer (`ans`) with the number of chosen vertices minus 2 (`x - 2`). This is because any polygon with \( k \) vertices can be divided into \( k - 2 \) triangles.

3. **Checking Adjacent Vertices**:
   - The program iterates through the chosen vertices to check if consecutive vertices are adjacent. If they are, it increments the answer by 1 for each pair of adjacent vertices.

4. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - The program handles special cases where the first and last chosen vertices are adjacent to each other, incrementing the answer by 1 in such cases.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the final value of `ans`, which is the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed without needing to choose any additional vertices.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
