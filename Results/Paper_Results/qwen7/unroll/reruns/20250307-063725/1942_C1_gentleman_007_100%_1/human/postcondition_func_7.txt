The function accepts a 2D list `l` of integers. It returns a 2D list `p` of dimensions `(n+1) x (m+1)`, where each element `p[i][j]` (for `i` from 1 to `n` and `j` from 1 to `m`) contains the sum of all elements in the submatrix `l[0...i-1][0...j-1]`, and the first row and first column of `p` are all zeros.
