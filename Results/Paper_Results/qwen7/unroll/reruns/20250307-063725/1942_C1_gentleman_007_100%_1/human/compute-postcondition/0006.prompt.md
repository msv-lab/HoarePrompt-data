You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The provided function `func_25` does not seem to relate to the problem description at all. It appears to be a breadth-first search (BFS) function that prints the order in which vertices are visited. However, the problem requires a solution to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the problem description and the variables in the function signature, we need to focus on the input variables and their relationships. Here's the relevant information extracted:

### Problem Description
Bessie has a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, and she has already chosen \( x \) vertices. You need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to \( y \) additional vertices. Note that \( y = 0 \) in this version of the problem.

### Function Signature
```python
def func(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    # Implementation details are missing, but we need to focus on the input variables
    pass
```

### Precondition
**n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, where y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

### Precondition
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer such that y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

Combining these, the final precondition is:
```
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
```
def func_25(ver):
    q = deque()
    q.append(ver)
    vis[ver] = 1
    while len(q):
        ver = q.popleft()
        
        print(ver, end=' ')
        
        for node in graph[ver]:
            if not vis[node]:
                q.append(node)
                vis[node] = 1
        
    #State: The output state will be a space-separated sequence of integers representing all the vertices in the graph that are reachable from the starting vertex `ver`, including `ver` itself.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `chosen_vertices`. `n` is an integer representing the number of sides of a polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. `x` is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5). `y` is an integer with a fixed value of 0. `chosen_vertices` is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to y additional vertices.
