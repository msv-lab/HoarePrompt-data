Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem description. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a polygon. However, the program includes a large number of utility functions and does not define a main function to solve the problem.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple case where we have a polygon with 8 sides (`n=8`), and Bessie has chosen vertices `1, 6, 2, 5`. According to the problem, the maximum number of triangular pieces that can be formed is 2. However, the provided program does not implement any logic to calculate this value.

Here is a potential issue:
- The program does not have a function that calculates the number of triangles that can be formed from the given vertices.
- It does not handle the logic to ensure that the chosen vertices form non-intersecting diagonals and maximize the number of triangles.

Since the program does not contain any logic to solve the given problem, it fails to meet the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
