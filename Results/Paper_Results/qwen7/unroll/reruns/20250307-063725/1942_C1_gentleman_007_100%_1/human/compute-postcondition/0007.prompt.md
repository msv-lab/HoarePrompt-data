Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `j` is equal to `len(b)`, `a` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `b` is a list of integers where each integer is from 1 to the length of `a`, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen in the polygon cake problem, the length of `b` is equal to `x`, `y` is 0, `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (`len(a)` + 1) x (`len(b)` + 1), where each element is filled based on the longest common subsequence (LCS) between string `a` and list `b` converted to a string, considering the LCS length at each position (i, j), `l` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while i != 0 and j != 0:
    if dp[i][j] == dp[i][j - 1]:
        j -= 1
    elif dp[i][j] == dp[i - 1][j]:
        i -= 1
    else:
        i -= 1
        j -= 1
        l.append(a[i])



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
