The only variable in the loop head is `q`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `len(q) > 0`. Right before the loop, `q` is a deque object containing the element `ver`, which means `len(q)` is 1. Since `len(q)` is already greater than 0, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`q` is a deque object containing the element `ver`, `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `chosen_vertices` is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `vis[ver]` is set to 1**
