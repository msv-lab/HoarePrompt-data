Output State: **The output state will be a space-separated sequence of integers representing all the vertices in the graph that are reachable from the starting vertex `ver`, including `ver` itself.**

Explanation: The given loop performs a breadth-first search (BFS) on the graph starting from the vertex `ver`. It prints each vertex as it visits it, ensuring that all reachable vertices are printed exactly once. The `q` deque is used to manage the queue of vertices to visit next, and `vis` is a list that keeps track of which vertices have already been visited. Since the loop continues until `q` is empty, it will process all reachable vertices from `ver`.
