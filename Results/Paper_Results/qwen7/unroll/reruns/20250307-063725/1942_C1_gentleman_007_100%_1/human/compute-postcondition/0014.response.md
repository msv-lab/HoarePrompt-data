Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns a list `p` containing boolean values. Each element in the list corresponds to a number from 0 to `num`, where `True` indicates that the number is prime and `False` indicates that it is composite. Additionally, the function populates two auxiliary lists, `Lowest_Prime` and `Highest_Prime`, which store the smallest and largest prime factors for each number, respectively, but these lists are not returned.**
