The function accepts a non-negative integer x, representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen from a polygon. If x is 0 or 1, it returns x directly. Otherwise, it uses binary search to find the largest integer mid such that mid² ≤ x < (mid + 1)², and returns mid. The returned value represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen from a polygon.
