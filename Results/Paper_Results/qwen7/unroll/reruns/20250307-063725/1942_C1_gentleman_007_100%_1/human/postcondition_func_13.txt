The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the keys are integers representing vertices chosen by Bessie, and the values are the number of times each vertex appears (which should be 1 since the vertices are distinct). It calculates the sum of each key in the dictionary raised to the power of 0 (since `d[i]` is always 1, `d[i] - 1` is 0) multiplied by (`i - 1`). Since any number raised to the power of 0 is 1, the function returns the sum of `i - 1` for all keys in `d`, which ultimately results in 0.
