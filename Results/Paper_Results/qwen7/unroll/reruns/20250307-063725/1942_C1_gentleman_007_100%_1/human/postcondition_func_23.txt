The function performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of a polygon represented by a graph. It starts from a given vertex and visits all reachable vertices, printing each vertex in the order they are visited. The function modifies the `vis` list to mark vertices as visited and uses a stack to keep track of vertices to visit next. If the starting vertex is unvisited, it marks it as visited and continues the traversal. If the starting vertex is already visited, no further action is taken for that vertex.
