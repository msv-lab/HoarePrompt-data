The provided function `func_25` does not seem to relate to the problem description at all. It appears to be a breadth-first search (BFS) function that prints the order in which vertices are visited. However, the problem requires a solution to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the problem description and the variables in the function signature, we need to focus on the input variables and their relationships. Here's the relevant information extracted:

### Problem Description
Bessie has a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, and she has already chosen \( x \) vertices. You need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to \( y \) additional vertices. Note that \( y = 0 \) in this version of the problem.

### Function Signature
```python
def func(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    # Implementation details are missing, but we need to focus on the input variables
    pass
```

### Precondition
**n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, where y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

### Precondition
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer such that y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

Combining these, the final precondition is:
```
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
