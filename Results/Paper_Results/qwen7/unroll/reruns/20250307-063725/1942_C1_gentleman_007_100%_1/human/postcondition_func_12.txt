Functionality: The function accepts an integer `n` representing a number and returns a dictionary `d` containing the prime factorization of `n`. If `n` is greater than 1, the count of each prime factor in the dictionary is incremented by 1. If `n` is not greater than 1, the dictionary remains unchanged.
