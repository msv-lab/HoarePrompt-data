The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of sides of the polygon), `m` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers from 1 to `n` representing the chosen vertices). After executing, it returns a nested list where each of the `n` lists contains `m` elements, and each element in these lists is a list identical to `v`.
