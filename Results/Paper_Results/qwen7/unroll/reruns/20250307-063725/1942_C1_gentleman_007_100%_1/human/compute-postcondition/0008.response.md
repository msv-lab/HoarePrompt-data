Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is the string formed by joining all elements in list `l`.**

Explanation: The code `s = ''.join(l)` creates a string `s` by joining all elements in the list `l`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. The list `l` is used to form the string `s`, so `s` is now the string representation of the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two sequences, given that `l` originally contained the characters forming the LCS.
