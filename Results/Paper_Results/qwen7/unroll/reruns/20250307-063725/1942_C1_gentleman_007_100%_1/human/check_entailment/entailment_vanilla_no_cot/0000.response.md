Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed from a regular polygon with `n` sides, given `x` vertices already chosen by Bessie and a limit `y` on the additional vertices you can choose.

However, the code defines a large number of utility functions (ranging from mathematical operations to graph-related functions) that are not relevant to solving the specific problem at hand. There is no function that processes the input to calculate the desired output.

To solve the problem, you need to focus on the combinatorial aspect of forming triangles within a polygon. Specifically, for a polygon with `n` sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is `n-2`. Given `x` vertices already chosen, you need to determine how many additional vertices can be chosen to maximize the number of triangles.

Here's a simplified approach to solve the problem:

1. Calculate the total number of triangles that can be formed in an `n`-sided polygon.
2. Determine how many additional vertices can be chosen to maximize the number of triangles, considering the constraints on `x` and `y`.

Since `y = 0` in this version of the problem, you cannot choose any additional vertices, so the number of triangles is simply the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` vertices already chosen.

Given the constraints, the solution would be straightforward and does not require complex functions. Here is a simple implementation:

```python
def max_triangles(n, x, y):
    # Since y = 0, we cannot choose any additional vertices
    # The maximum number of triangles is n-2
    return n - 2

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = func_2()
    if y == 0:
        print(max_triangles(n, x, y))
```

This code snippet correctly implements the logic to solve the problem without the unnecessary utility functions. Therefore, the original code is incorrect.
