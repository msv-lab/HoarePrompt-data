You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a positive integer.
def func_11(num):
    prime = [(True) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Highest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    Lowest_Prime = [(0) for i in range(num + 1)]
    prime[0] = prime[1] = False
    p = 2
    while p <= num:
        if prime[p] == True:
            Lowest_Prime[p] = p
            Highest_Prime[p] = p
            for i in range(2 * p, num + 1, p):
                prime[i] = False
                Highest_Prime[i] = p
                if Lowest_Prime[i] == 0:
                    Lowest_Prime[i] = p
        
        p += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `prime` is a list where all prime numbers up to `num` are marked as `False`, and composite numbers are marked as `False`. For each number `i` from 2 to `num`, `Lowest_Prime[i]` is set to the smallest prime factor of `i`, and `Highest_Prime[i]` is set to the largest prime factor of `i`, which is `Lowest_Prime[i]` itself since we update it only when `Lowest_Prime[i]` is initially `0`.
    #
    #In simpler terms, after the loop runs, `prime` will contain `False` for all non-prime numbers and `True` for prime numbers. The `Lowest_Prime` list will store the smallest prime factor for each number, and the `Highest_Prime` list will be identical to `Lowest_Prime` because we only update `Highest_Prime[i]` when `Lowest_Prime[i]` is first set.
    p = []
    for i in range(num + 1):
        if prime[i]:
            p.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `prime` is a list where all prime numbers up to `num` are marked as `True`, and composite numbers are marked as `False`. `p` is a list containing all the prime numbers up to `num`. `Lowest_Prime` and `Highest_Prime` lists are identical and contain the smallest prime factor for each number up to `num`.
    return p
    #The program returns a list 'p' containing all the prime numbers up to 'num'. Each element in the list 'p' is set to True if the corresponding index is a prime number, and False if it is a composite number.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter num, which is a positive integer. It returns a list 'p', where each element in the list is set to True if the corresponding index is a prime number, and False if it is a composite number, for all indices up to 'num'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'p' containing all the prime numbers up to 'num'. Each element in the list 'p' is set to True if the corresponding index is a prime number, and False if it is a composite number.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
