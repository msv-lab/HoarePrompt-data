You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initialized—only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: The provided function `func_25` does not seem to relate to the problem description at all. It appears to be a breadth-first search (BFS) function that prints the order in which vertices are visited. However, the problem requires a solution to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed.

Given the problem description and the variables in the function signature, we need to focus on the input variables and their relationships. Here's the relevant information extracted:

### Problem Description
Bessie has a regular polygon with \( n \) sides, and she has already chosen \( x \) vertices. You need to determine the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing up to \( y \) additional vertices. Note that \( y = 0 \) in this version of the problem.

### Function Signature
```python
def func(n, x, y, chosen_vertices):
    # Implementation details are missing, but we need to focus on the input variables
    pass
```

### Precondition
**n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, where 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, where 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose, where y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.**

### Precondition
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**
**x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).**
**y is an integer such that y = 0.**
**chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**

Combining these, the final precondition is:
```
**n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and y is an integer such that y = 0. chosen_vertices is a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
```
```
def func_25(ver):
```
Output: 
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
In your response strictly use the format: Functionality: **the functionality you calculate.**, and describe this functionality in Natural language easily understandable by humans
