Output State: **The function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, or None if the target node is not reachable. The queue is empty, and the visited set contains all nodes that are reachable from the start node and have been checked.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the queue will be empty because all possible paths have been explored. The visited set will contain all nodes that are reachable from the start node and have been checked during the traversal. The function will return the shortest distance to the target node if it was found; otherwise, it will return `None` if the target node is not reachable from the start node.
