### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Leaf Identification:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly constructs the tree using an adjacency list representation.
   - It identifies the two leaves of the tree. Since the problem guarantees that the tree has exactly two leaves, this part is correct.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - The `bfs` function is used to calculate the distance from the starting node to each leaf.
   - BFS is a correct approach for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which is suitable for calculating distances in a tree.

3. **Winning Condition Logic:**
   - The logic for determining the winner is based on the parity of the distances to the leaves.
   - If the sum of the distances to the two leaves is odd, Ron wins because he makes the first move and can always force the game into a position where the opponent cannot win.
   - If the sum of the distances is even, Hermione wins because she can mirror Ron's moves and force him into a losing position.

4. **Input Handling:**
   - The input handling is correct, as it processes the tree edges and the starting node for each round.
   - The function correctly returns the winner based on the calculated distances.

Given that the provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and it handles the input and output as specified, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
