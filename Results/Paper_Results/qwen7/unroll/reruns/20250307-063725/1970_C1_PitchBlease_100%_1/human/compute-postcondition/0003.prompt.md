Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.
Code of the loop:
while queue:
    current, dist = queue.popleft()
    if current == target:
        return dist
    for neighbor in tree[current]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            visited.add(neighbor)
            queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
