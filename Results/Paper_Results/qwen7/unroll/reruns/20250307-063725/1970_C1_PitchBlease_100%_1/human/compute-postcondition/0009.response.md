Postcondition: **`dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`, `n` is the integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection, `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`. The condition is that either `dist1` is odd or `dist2` is odd.**
