The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers. It performs a breadth-first search on a tree structure represented by the `tree` dictionary to find the shortest path distance from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable, it returns the distance; otherwise, it returns -1.
