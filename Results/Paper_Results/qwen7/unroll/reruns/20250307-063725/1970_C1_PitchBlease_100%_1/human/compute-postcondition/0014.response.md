The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree.
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed.

The tree has exactly two leaves, and the function assumes that the input satisfies this condition. 

Based on the conditions provided, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`, and return either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the given conditions.
