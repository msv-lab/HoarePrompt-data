The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `queue` being non-empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`. Since the deque is non-empty, the loop can execute without any adjustments.

Therefore, no changes are needed to the state of the objects.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
