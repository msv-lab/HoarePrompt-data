Postcondition: **`dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `n` is the integer representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; `start` is an integer representing the starting node; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection; `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`; `dist1 % 2 == 0` and `dist2 % 2 == 0`**
