Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a tree with specific rules.
2. The key observation here is that the tree has exactly two leaves, and the game is essentially a Nim-like game where the player who faces an odd distance sum from the starting node to the two leaves wins, assuming optimal play.
3. Function `func_1` correctly constructs the tree and identifies the two leaves.
4. It then calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using BFS, as implemented in `bfs`.
5. The logic in `func_1` checks if either of these distances is odd. If at least one of them is odd, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
6. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided implementation should correctly determine the winner for any valid input.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
