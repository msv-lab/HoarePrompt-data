Output State: **`dist1` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]`; `n` is the integer representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; `start` is an integer representing the starting node; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one connection; `dist2` is the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[1]`.**

Explanation: The code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the shortest path distance from the starting node `start` to the second leaf node in the list `leaves` using the breadth-first search (bfs) algorithm. This distance is stored in the variable `dist2`. The values of `dist1`, `n`, `edges`, `start`, and `leaves` remain unchanged from their initial states.
