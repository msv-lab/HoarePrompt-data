Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.**

Explanation: The code initializes a queue using the `deque` function, which adds a single element to the queue: a tuple consisting of the `start` node and the distance `0`. The `start` and `target` variables remain unchanged, as well as the `tree` dictionary.
