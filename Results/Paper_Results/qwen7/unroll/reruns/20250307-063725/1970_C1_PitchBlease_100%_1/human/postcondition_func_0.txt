The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. It constructs an undirected graph from the given edges and identifies the two leaves of the tree. Then, it calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using breadth-first search (BFS). Based on whether these distances are odd or even, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
