Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (integers between 1 and `n-2` such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and attempts to divide the list into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the sorted `group_a` list, an empty `group_b` list, and an empty `group_c` list. If unsuccessful, it returns 'NO'.**
