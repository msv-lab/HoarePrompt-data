Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (integers between 1 and `n-2` such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). Depending on whether it's possible to divide the `numbers` list into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) where `group_a` contains exactly `na` elements, `group_b` contains exactly `nb` elements, `group_c` contains exactly `nc` elements, and `group_a` has all its elements sorted in descending order, the function returns either 'YES' along with the sorted `group_a` list, an empty `group_b` list, and an empty `group_c` list, or 'NO'.**
