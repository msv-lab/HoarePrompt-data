Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop is iterating over the variable `num` from the list `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `num`: This variable will take each element from the list `numbers` one by one during the loop iterations.
   - `numbers`: This is the list from which `num` is being taken.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `numbers` must contain at least one element. If `numbers` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, we need to ensure that `numbers` is not empty for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `num` will start as the first element of the list `numbers` in the first iteration.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `numbers` must have at least one element.
- `num` will be set to the first element of `numbers` in the first iteration.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`numbers` is a list of n positive integers sorted in descending order that must have at least one element, `num` is the first element of the list `numbers`**.
