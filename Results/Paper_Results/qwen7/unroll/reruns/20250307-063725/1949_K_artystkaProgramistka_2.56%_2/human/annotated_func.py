#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are positive integers such that a + b + c is the sum of some subset of the input integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_n from the problem description, and a, b, and c are the sizes of the three groups to be formed from those integers.
def func_1(a, b, c):
    return a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a
    #The program returns True if the conditions a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a are all satisfied, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integer parameters a, b, and c. It checks whether these values satisfy the triangle inequality theorem (i.e., a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a). If all conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, na, nb, and nc are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2 and na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each x_i in numbers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: Output State: `numbers` is a list of n positive integers sorted in descending order; `group_a` is a list containing all the numbers from the original `numbers` list; `group_b` is an empty list; `group_c` is an empty list; `sum_a` is the sum of all numbers in the original `numbers` list; `sum_b` is 0; `sum_c` is 0.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', 'group_a' which contains all the numbers from the original 'numbers' list (sorted in descending order), 'group_b' which is an empty list, and 'group_c' which is also an empty list.
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (an integer between 3 and 200,000), `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (integers between 1 and `n-2` such that their sum equals `n`), and `numbers` (a list of `n` positive integers). It sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and attempts to divide the list into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) based on the values of `na`, `nb`, and `nc`. If successful, it returns 'YES' along with the sorted `group_a` list, an empty `group_b` list, and an empty `group_c` list. If unsuccessful, it returns 'NO'.
