### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation array such that the element `x` is found at the position `l` after performing a binary search. This involves finding the index of `x` in the permutation and ensuring it is correctly placed before the binary search is applied.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm in `func_3` is implemented correctly. It uses the standard binary search approach with `low` and `high` pointers to find the correct position of `x`.

3. **Swapping Elements**: The provided solution attempts to place `x` at the correct position using at most two swaps. However, the current implementation only checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k` and prints `0` if true. If not, it prints `1` and performs a single swap with `pos`. This approach does not guarantee the correct placement of `x` in all cases, especially when `x` is not at the `low` or `pos` positions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), the current code correctly prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the correct position, the current code only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient to place `x` correctly.
   - The problem statement guarantees that two operations are always sufficient, but the current implementation does not account for all possible scenarios where two swaps might be necessary.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To ensure `x` is correctly placed, we need to consider the possibility that `x` might be at either `low` or `pos`, and we need to handle both cases properly.
   - We should also consider the possibility that `x` might be at a different position, requiring two swaps.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic of the binary search.
   - The current implementation in `func_3` does not explicitly handle the scenario where `x` is not at the `low` or `pos` positions and requires a second swap.
   - The annotated code indicates that the set `st` is used to store intermediate indices, but it does not show how these indices are utilized to perform the necessary swaps.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The current implementation in `func_3` does not guarantee that `x` will be correctly placed in all cases, even though the problem statement guarantees that two operations are always sufficient.
   - The annotated code confirms that the binary search logic is correct, but it does not show how the required swaps are performed in all scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis, the current implementation in `func_3` does not guarantee the correct placement of `x` in all scenarios, even though the problem statement guarantees that two operations are always sufficient. The annotated code confirms the correctness of the binary search but does not address the issue of handling all possible swap scenarios.

### Final:
**False**
