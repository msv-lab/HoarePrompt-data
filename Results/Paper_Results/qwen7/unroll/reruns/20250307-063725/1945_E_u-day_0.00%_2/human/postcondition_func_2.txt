The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n. It performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints 0. If `k` is not found, it prints 1 followed by the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The function returns an integer, which will be 0 if `k` is found or 1 if `k` is not found.
