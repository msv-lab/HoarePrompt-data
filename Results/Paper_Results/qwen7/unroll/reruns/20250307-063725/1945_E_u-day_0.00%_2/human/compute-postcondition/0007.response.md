Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is n - 1, `st` is an empty set.**

The code creates an empty set named `st`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
