Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.**

Explanation: The code initializes `arr` by calling the function `func_2()`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state since no operations are performed on them within the given code snippet. Therefore, `arr` is the result of `func_2()`, and the conditions on `n` and `k` still hold true.
