You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `low + 1` is less than `high`. During each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`. The set `st` accumulates all these `mid` values. When the loop ends, `low` and `high` will be adjacent, and `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` if it exists within this range; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high, 0
    #State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates. Regardless of whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the final state of `pos`, `st`, `low`, and `high` remains consistent with the conditions described above.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). It returns an integer.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
