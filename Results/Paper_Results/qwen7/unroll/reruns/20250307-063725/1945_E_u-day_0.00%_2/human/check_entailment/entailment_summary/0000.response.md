Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to rearrange the permutation such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing binary search. This can be achieved by finding the position of `x` and ensuring that the binary search starts with the correct initial bounds.
- The provided code does not actually perform any swaps to rearrange the permutation. Instead, it performs a binary search directly on the given permutation and prints the result without modifying the permutation.
- The function `func_3()` finds the position of `x` in the permutation using a binary search approach but does not ensure that the binary search will start correctly with the initial bounds. It also does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the permutation.
- The function `func_2()` returns a list of test cases, but it does not modify the permutations within those test cases.
- The function `func_1()` reads the necessary parameters for each test case but does not perform any operations on the permutations.

Given the problem statement, the provided functions do not meet the requirements because they do not rearrange the permutation as required before performing the binary search. They simply perform the binary search on the given permutation without any modifications.

Correctness: **False**
