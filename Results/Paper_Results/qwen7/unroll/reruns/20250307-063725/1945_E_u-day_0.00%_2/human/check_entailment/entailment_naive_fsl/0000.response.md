Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses a set to store mid indices, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Additionally, the logic for determining the position of `x` in the permutation is flawed. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Use of Set**: The set `st` is used to store mid indices, which is not required and can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Logic Flaw in Binary Search**: The binary search logic is not correctly implemented. The variable `pos` is supposed to store the position of `x`, but the program does not update `pos` correctly during the binary search process.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
5 3
3 1 2
```

- The permutation is `[3, 1, 2]` and we need to find `3`.
- The correct position of `3` is `1` (0-based index).
- The program will not correctly find the position of `3` using the current logic.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    
    # Perform binary search
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == k:
            pos = mid
            break
        elif arr[mid] < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    if pos != -1:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Find the correct position by scanning the array
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == k:
                pos = i
                break
        
        print(1)
        print(pos + 1, 1)  # Swap the element at position pos with the first element
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and handles the case where the element might not be present in the array.
