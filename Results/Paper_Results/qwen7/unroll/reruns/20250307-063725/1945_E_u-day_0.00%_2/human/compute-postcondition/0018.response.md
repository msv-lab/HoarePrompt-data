Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: n (a positive integer representing the length of the permutation), k (an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n), and arr (a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation). It returns an integer.**

This means the function `func_3` takes in three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer indicating the size of the permutation; `k`, which is an integer within the range from 1 to `n`; and `arr`, which is a list containing `n` distinct integers ranging from 1 to `n` that represent a permutation. The function then returns an integer based on the given parameters.
