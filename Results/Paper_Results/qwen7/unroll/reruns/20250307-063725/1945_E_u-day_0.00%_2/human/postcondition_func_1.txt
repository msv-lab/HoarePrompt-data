The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), two integers \( n \) and \( x \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), and a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) consisting of distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). After processing all test cases, it returns a list generated by `func_1()`.
