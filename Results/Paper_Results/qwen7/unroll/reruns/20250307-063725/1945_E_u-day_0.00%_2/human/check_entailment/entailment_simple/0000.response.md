Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at position \(l\). The provided code does not correctly implement this logic. Specifically, the binary search part of the code is flawed and does not ensure that the target value \(x\) is placed at the correct position \(l\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function reads two integers from the input, which should be the values of \(n\) and \(x\).
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function calls `func_1` and converts its output into a list. However, the code snippet provided does not show the implementation of `func_2`, so we assume it correctly processes the input to provide a list of integers representing the permutation.
   - **Function `func_3`**: This function is supposed to find the correct positions to swap elements to ensure the binary search finds \(x\) at the correct position. However, the logic inside `func_3` is incorrect:
     - The binary search loop is not correctly implemented. It does not adjust the indices `low` and `high` to move towards the correct position of \(x\).
     - The logic for printing the number of swaps and the indices to swap is also incorrect. It prints `low + 1` and `pos + 1` without ensuring that the target value \(x\) is correctly placed.

3. **Expected Correctness**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, one would need to identify the correct positions to swap elements so that the binary search can find \(x\) at the correct position.
   - The provided code does not achieve this. Instead, it seems to be attempting a binary search on a potentially unsorted list, which is not the intended approach.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
