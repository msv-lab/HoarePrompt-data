Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `k`, `arr`, and `pos` remain unchanged from the initial state.
