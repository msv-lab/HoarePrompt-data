Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and the values of `n` and `k` are the results of the function `func_1()` call.**

Explanation: The code `n, k = func_1()` calls the function `func_1()`, which returns two values: `n` and `k`. These values are then assigned to the variables `n` and `k` respectively. The initial conditions that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n are preserved, and now these variables hold the specific values returned by `func_1()`.
