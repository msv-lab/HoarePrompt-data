Based on the initial state described:

- `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low + 1` equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`.
- Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer `1`.

Output: **1**
