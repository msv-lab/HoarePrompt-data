Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range object `range(n)`. The variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1` during each iteration of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i` being 0 (the default starting value for `range`), we need to ensure that `i` is set to 0 at the start of the loop.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: Since `n` is a positive integer and the loop will run until `i` is less than `n`, `n` should be a positive integer greater than 0.

5. **Adjust the state of `i`**: As mentioned, `i` should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State:**
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer**
