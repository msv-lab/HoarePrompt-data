You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n and x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers, which are the values of n and x separated by a space, converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, `n` and `x`, from the standard input, separated by a space, converts them to integers, and returns a map object containing these two integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of size n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_1(), which we do not have the definition of, but it processes the test cases, n, x, and permutation p as described.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), two integers \( n \) and \( x \) (where \( 1 \leq x \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 \)), and a permutation \( p \) of size \( n \) consisting of distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). After processing all test cases, it returns a list generated by `func_1()`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.

        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `low + 1` is less than `high`. During each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`. The set `st` accumulates all these `mid` values. When the loop ends, `low` and `high` will be adjacent, and `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` if it exists within this range; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high, 0
    #State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates. Regardless of whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the final state of `pos`, `st`, `low`, and `high` remains consistent with the conditions described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n. It performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints 0. If `k` is not found, it prints 1 followed by the value of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`. The function returns an integer, which will be 0 if `k` is found or 1 if `k` is not found.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses a set to store mid indices, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Additionally, the logic for determining the position of `x` in the permutation is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Use of Set**: The set `st` is used to store mid indices, which is not required and can lead to incorrect results.
2. **Logic Flaw in Binary Search**: The binary search logic is not correctly implemented. The variable `pos` is supposed to store the position of `x`, but the program does not update `pos` correctly during the binary search process.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
```
5 3
3 1 2
```

- The permutation is `[3, 1, 2]` and we need to find `3`.
- The correct position of `3` is `1` (0-based index).
- The program will not correctly find the position of `3` using the current logic.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    
    # Perform binary search
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == k:
            pos = mid
            break
        elif arr[mid] < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    if pos != -1:
        print(0)
    else:
        # Find the correct position by scanning the array
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == k:
                pos = i
                break
        
        print(1)
        print(pos + 1, 1)  # Swap the element at position pos with the first element
```

This corrected version ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and handles the case where the element might not be present in the array.
