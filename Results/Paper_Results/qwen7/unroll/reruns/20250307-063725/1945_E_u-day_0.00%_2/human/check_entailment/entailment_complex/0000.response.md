Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions and Inputs**: The program correctly defines three functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`) and handles the input as specified in the problem statement. `func_1` reads two integers `n` and `x`, `func_2` processes the test cases, and `func_3` performs the binary search and outputs the required swaps.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implemented in `func_3` is mostly correct but has some issues. Specifically:
   - The binary search should be used to find the position of `x` in the permutation `arr` and ensure that `p_l` (the element at the `l` index) is equal to `x` after the binary search.
   - The logic inside the while loop is flawed because it uses `low` and `high` to determine the position of `x` without ensuring that the element at `low` is `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_3` attempts to swap elements to ensure that `x` is at the correct position, but the logic for determining the swaps is incorrect. The provided code does not actually perform the necessary swaps to reorder the permutation correctly for the binary search to work.

4. **Output Format**: The output format is correct according to the problem statement, but the content of the output is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the binary search and the swap logic.

Given these points, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The binary search and swap logic are incorrect, leading to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**
