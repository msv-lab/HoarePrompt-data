Postcondition: **`pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates. Regardless of whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the final state of `pos`, `st`, `low`, and `high` remains consistent with the conditions described above.**
