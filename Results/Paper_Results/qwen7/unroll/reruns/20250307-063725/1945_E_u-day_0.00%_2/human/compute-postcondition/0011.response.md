Output State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `low + 1` is less than `high`. During each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`. The set `st` accumulates all these `mid` values. When the loop ends, `low` and `high` will be adjacent, and `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` if it exists within this range; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
