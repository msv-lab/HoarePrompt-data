### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation array such that the element `x` is found at the position `l` after performing a binary search. This involves finding the index of `x` in the permutation and ensuring it is correctly placed before the binary search is applied.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The provided function `func_3` implements a binary search to find the first occurrence of `x` in the permutation array `arr`. The function correctly identifies the position of `x` and prints `0` if `x` is found at the `low` position. If `x` is not found at the `low` position, it prints `1` and performs a single swap with `pos`. However, the function does not explicitly handle the scenario where `x` is not at the `low` or `pos` positions, and it assumes that a single swap is sufficient to place `x` correctly.

3. **Swapping Elements**: The function `func_3` only performs a single swap if `x` is not found at the `low` position. According to the problem statement, two operations are always sufficient to place `x` correctly. The function does not account for the possibility that two swaps might be necessary to place `x` correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), the function correctly prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the correct position, the function only performs a single swap, which may not be sufficient to place `x` correctly. For example, if `x` is at a position other than `low` or `pos`, a single swap might not move `x` to the correct position.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To ensure `x` is correctly placed, we need to consider the possibility that `x` might be at a different position, requiring two swaps.
   - The function should explicitly handle the scenario where `x` is not at the `low` or `pos` positions and perform the necessary swaps to place `x` correctly.

6. **Function Summary**: The function summary indicates that the function performs a binary search and prints `0` if `x` is found at the `low` position or `1` followed by the positions of the swap if `x` is not found at the `low` position. The function does not guarantee that two operations are always sufficient to place `x` correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not guarantee the correct placement of `x` in all scenarios. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
