Based on the initial state provided:

- `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`.
- Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates.
- Additionally, `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

From the above, we can deduce that since `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, `k` is not found in `arr`. Therefore, `pos` must be -1. Also, because `low` + 1 equals `high`, it means the search range has narrowed down to a single element, and this element is not `k`.

So, the expression `low + 1` will be `high`, and `pos + 1` will be `-1 + 1`, which is `0`.

Output: **high, 0**
