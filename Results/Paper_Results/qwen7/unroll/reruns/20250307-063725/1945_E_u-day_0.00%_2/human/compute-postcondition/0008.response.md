Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - For the loop condition `low + 1 < high` to be true, `low` must be less than `high - 1`.
   - Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, we need to ensure that `0 + 1 < n - 1` is true.
   - This simplifies to `1 < n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n > 2`.

4. **Check the constraints on `n`**:
   - From the initial state, `n` is a positive integer.
   - We need `n` to be greater than 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` to ensure that `n > 2`.

Therefore, the modified state right before the loop should be:

**State: `n` must be greater than 2, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`, `low` is 0, `high` is n - 1, `st` is an empty set.**

Since the other variables do not affect the loop condition directly, they remain unchanged.
