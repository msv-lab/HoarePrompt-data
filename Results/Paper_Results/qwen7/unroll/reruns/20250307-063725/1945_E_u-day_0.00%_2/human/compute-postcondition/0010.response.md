Output State: `low` is the index of the largest value in `arr` that is less than or equal to `k`, `high` is `low` + 1, `st` is a set containing all the indices `mid` where `arr[mid]` was compared against `k` during the loop, `pos` remains -1 as it was not modified within the loop, `n` remains unchanged, and `k` remains unchanged.

Explanation: The loop performs a binary search on `arr` to find the position of `k` or the largest index with a value less than or equal to `k`. The variable `st` keeps track of all the midpoints checked during the process. Since the loop condition `low + 1 < high` ensures that `low` and `high` converge, `low` will be the largest index where `arr[low]` is less than or equal to `k`, and `high` will be `low + 1`. If `k` is not found in `arr`, `pos` remains -1.
