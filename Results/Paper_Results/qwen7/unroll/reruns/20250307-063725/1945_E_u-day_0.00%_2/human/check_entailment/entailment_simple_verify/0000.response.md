### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements and the original assessment.

#### Problem Statement Recap:
- We need to find the position of a number `x` in a permutation `p` using at most 2 swaps.
- The program should output the number of swaps (`k`) and the indices of the swaps if necessary.

#### Original Assessment Recap:
- The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because:
  1. It incorrectly uses a set to store mid indices.
  2. The binary search logic is flawed and does not correctly determine the position of `x`.

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Use of Set:**
   - The set `st` is indeed unnecessary and does not contribute to finding the position of `x`. This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Logic Flaw in Binary Search:**
   - The binary search logic is flawed because:
     - The variable `pos` is only updated when `arr[mid] == k`, but it should be updated even if `arr[mid] < k` or `arr[mid] > k` to keep track of the potential position of `x`.
     - The logic for updating `low` and `high` is also incorrect. It should ensure that the search space is narrowed down correctly.

3. **Corrected Version:**
   - The provided corrected version in the original assessment addresses these issues:
     - It performs a standard binary search to find the position of `x`.
     - If `x` is found, it prints `0` and exits.
     - If `x` is not found, it scans the array to find the correct position and prints `1` followed by the indices of the swap.

4. **Program Evaluation:**
   - Let's evaluate the given annotated code against the problem statement:
     - The program reads the input correctly and initializes the necessary variables.
     - The binary search logic is implemented but has flaws.
     - The logic for handling the case where `x` is not found in the array is missing.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described. It fails to handle the case where `x` is not found in the array and does not update `pos` correctly during the binary search process.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect according to the problem statement and the original assessment.
