Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The relevant variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq n\).
- `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is \(n - 1\).
- `st` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Given `low = 0` and `high = n - 1`, the condition becomes \(0 + 1 < n - 1\) or \(1 < n - 1\), which simplifies to \(n > 2\).

Since `n` is a positive integer, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

4. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `n` must be greater than 2.
   - All other variables (`k`, `arr`, `pos`, `low`, `high`, `st`) do not need to be adjusted as they do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the final answer is:
State: **`n` must be greater than 2**
