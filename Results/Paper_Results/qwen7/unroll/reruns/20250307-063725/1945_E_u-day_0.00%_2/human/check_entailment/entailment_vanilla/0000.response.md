### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires rearranging a permutation array such that the element `x` is found at the position `l` after performing a binary search. This involves finding the index of `x` in the permutation and ensuring it is correctly placed before the binary search is applied.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is implemented correctly in the function `func_3`. It uses the standard binary search approach with `low` and `high` pointers to find the correct position of `x`.

3. **Swapping Elements**: The provided solution attempts to place `x` at the correct position using at most two swaps. However, the current implementation only checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k` and prints `0` if true. If not, it prints `1` and performs a single swap with `pos`. This approach does not guarantee the correct placement of `x` in all cases, especially when `x` is not at the `low` or `pos` positions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is already at the correct position (`arr[low] == k`), the current code correctly prints `0`.
   - If `x` is not at the correct position, the current code only performs one swap, which may not be sufficient to place `x` correctly.
   - The problem statement guarantees that two operations are always sufficient, but the current implementation does not account for all possible scenarios where two swaps might be necessary.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To ensure `x` is correctly placed, we need to consider the possibility that `x` might be at either `low` or `pos`, and we need to handle both cases properly.
   - We should also consider the possibility that `x` might be at a different position, requiring two swaps.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not guarantee the correct placement of `x` in all scenarios. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
