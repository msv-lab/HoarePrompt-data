# Problem:
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

# Annotated Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of n and x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers, which are the values of n and x separated by a space, converted to integers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, each test case consists of two integers n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of size n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by func_1(), which we do not have the definition of, but it processes the test cases, n, x, and permutation p as described.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and arr is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n representing the permutation.
def func_3():
    n, k = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()` call, and `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`.
    low, high = 0, n - 1
    st = set()
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        st.add(mid)
        
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `low + 1` is less than `high`. During each iteration, it calculates the middle index `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`. The set `st` accumulates all these `mid` values. When the loop ends, `low` and `high` will be adjacent, and `pos` will be the index of the first occurrence of `k` if it exists within this range; otherwise, `pos` remains -1.
    if (arr[low] == k) :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    else :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
        #This is printed: high, 0
    #State: `pos` is either the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` where `low` + 1 equals `high`, or -1 if `k` is not found in `arr`. The set `st` contains all the indices `mid` calculated during the loop iterations, where `low + 1 < high`. Variables `low`, `high`, and `st` reflect the final state after the loop terminates. Regardless of whether `arr[low]` is equal to `k` or not, the final state of `pos`, `st`, `low`, and `high` remains consistent with the conditions described above.
