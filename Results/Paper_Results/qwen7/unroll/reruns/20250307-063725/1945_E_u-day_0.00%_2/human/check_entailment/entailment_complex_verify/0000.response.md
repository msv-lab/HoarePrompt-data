### Reasoning

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment to determine its correctness.

#### Given Program Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads two integers from the input and returns them as a map object.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the map object returned by `func_1()` into a list.
   - `func_3()`: Implements the binary search logic and outputs the necessary information.

2. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - Reads `n` and `k` using `func_1()`.
   - Calls `func_2()` to get the permutation `arr`.
   - Initializes `pos` to `-1` and sets `low` and `high` to `0` and `n - 1` respectively.
   - Uses a binary search loop to find the position of `k` in `arr`.
     - The loop continues as long as `low + 1 < high`.
     - Calculates the midpoint `mid` and updates `low` or `high` based on the comparison of `arr[mid]` with `k`.
     - Adds `mid` to the set `st` to keep track of visited indices.
   - After the loop, checks if `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.
     - If true, prints `0`.
     - If false, prints `1` followed by `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The use of the set `st` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - The logic for determining the position of `k` in the permutation is flawed because `pos` is not updated correctly during the binary search process.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the issues:
     - **Incorrect Use of Set**: The set `st` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results.
     - **Logic Flaw in Binary Search**: The variable `pos` is not updated correctly during the binary search process.

5. **Corrected Version**:
   - The provided corrected version ensures that the binary search is performed correctly and handles the case where the element might not be present in the array.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. The set `st` is unnecessary and the logic for updating `pos` during the binary search is flawed.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the issues identified in the original assessment.
