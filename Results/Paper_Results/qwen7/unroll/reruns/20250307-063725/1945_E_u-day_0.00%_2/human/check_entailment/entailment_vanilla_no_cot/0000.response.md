Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution attempts to find the position of `k` in the array using binary search directly without sorting, which is not the correct approach according to the problem statement. The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work correctly such that `p[l] == x` when the binary search ends.

The function `func_3` does not implement the required logic to rearrange the array with at most 2 swaps. Instead, it tries to perform a binary search on the unsorted array to find the position of `k`, which is not the intended solution.

To solve the problem correctly, you would need to implement a strategy to rearrange the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search works as expected. The provided code does not achieve this.
