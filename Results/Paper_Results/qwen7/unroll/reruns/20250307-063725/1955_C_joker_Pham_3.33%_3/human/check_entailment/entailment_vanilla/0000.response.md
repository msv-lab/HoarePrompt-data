### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the attacks until either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).

3. **Attacking Logic:**
   - The logic inside the while loop alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - If both ships have the same durability, the program checks if there are enough attacks left to sink both ships completely.
   - If one ship has higher durability than the other, the program checks if there are enough attacks left to sink the less durable ship completely.
   - If the durability of a ship reaches zero, it is considered sunk, and the corresponding pointer is adjusted accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `l` and `r` converge to the same ship.
   - It also handles cases where the number of remaining attacks is exactly enough to sink one of the ships but not both.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed at the end of each test case.

### Verification:

- The logic in the `while` loop correctly simulates the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- The conditions for sinking ships and adjusting the pointers are correctly implemented.
- The function handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
