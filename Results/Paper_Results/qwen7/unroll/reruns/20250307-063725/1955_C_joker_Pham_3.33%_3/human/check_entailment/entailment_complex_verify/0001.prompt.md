You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    return sunks
    #The program returns the number of valid operations performed, represented by the variable `sunks`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers. The function performs a series of operations where it attempts to reduce elements in the list `a` by doubling them from either end of the list, depending on their values, until `k` becomes zero or no further reductions can be made. For each successful reduction, it increments a counter `sunks`. After completing these operations, the function returns the total count of successful reductions, which is stored in `sunks`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to keep track of the number of sunk ships.
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the attacks until either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left (`k == 0`).

3. **Attacking Logic:**
   - The logic inside the while loop alternates between attacking the first and last ships.
   - If both ships have the same durability, the program checks if there are enough attacks left to sink both ships completely.
   - If one ship has higher durability than the other, the program checks if there are enough attacks left to sink the less durable ship completely.
   - If the durability of a ship reaches zero, it is considered sunk, and the corresponding pointer is adjusted accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where `l` and `r` converge to the same ship.
   - It also handles cases where the number of remaining attacks is exactly enough to sink one of the ships but not both.

5. **Output:**
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed at the end of each test case.

### Verification:

- The logic in the `while` loop correctly simulates the alternating attacks on the first and last ships.
- The conditions for sinking ships and adjusting the pointers are correctly implemented.
- The function handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of ships sunk by the Kraken based on the given problem description.
