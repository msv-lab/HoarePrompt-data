Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15, and `a` is a list of `n` positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i where 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The function returns the number of valid operations performed, represented by the variable `sunks`.**
