Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the variables and iterates over the test cases.
2. The `func_1` function aims to simulate the Kraken's attacks by reducing the durability of ships from both ends based on the given logic.
3. The logic inside the `while` loop checks whether the Kraken can attack the leftmost or rightmost ship and updates the durability accordingly.
4. The function correctly handles the case when the durability of a ship reaches zero, marking it as sunk and adjusting the indices `l` and `r`.
5. The function breaks the loop when there are no more attacks (`k == 0`) or when no further reductions can be made.
6. The provided example and the execution summary align with the expected behavior of the function.

Given the above points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
