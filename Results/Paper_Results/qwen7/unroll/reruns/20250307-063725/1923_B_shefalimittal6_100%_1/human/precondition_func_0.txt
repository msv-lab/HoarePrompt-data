a is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of n monsters, x is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the n monsters, and k is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second. The length of a and x is n, and 1 <= n <= 3 * 10^5, 1 <= k <= 2 * 10^9. The values in x are sorted in ascending order and are non-zero, with -n <= x[i] < x[i+1] <= n for all i.
