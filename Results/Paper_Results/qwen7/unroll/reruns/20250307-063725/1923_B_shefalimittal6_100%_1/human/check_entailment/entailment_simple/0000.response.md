### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining if it's possible to kill all monsters before they reach the player's starting position (point 0) using a limited number of bullets per second. The solution uses a greedy approach to prioritize targeting monsters that are closest to the player.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`x` values).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters until either:
     - All monsters are killed (`a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0`).
     - A monster reaches the player's position (`abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`).

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs (`n`, `k`, `a`, `x`), calls `func_1` with these inputs, and prints the result ('YES' or 'NO') based on the return value of `func_1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly prioritizes firing bullets at the closest monsters first, which ensures that the player stays safe for as long as possible.
   - The implementation in `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the appropriate results.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

### Correctness:
**True**
