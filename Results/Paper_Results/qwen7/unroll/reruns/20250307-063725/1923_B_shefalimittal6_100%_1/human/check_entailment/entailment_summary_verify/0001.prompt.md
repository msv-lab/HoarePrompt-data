You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Output

Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, x, k):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: abs(x[i]))
    distance = 0
    pos = 0
    while pos != len(sorted_indices):
        if abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance:
            return False
        rest = k
        while rest != 0 and pos != len(sorted_indices):
            delta = min(rest, a[sorted_indices[pos]])
            rest -= delta
            a[sorted_indices[pos]] -= delta
            if a[sorted_indices[pos]] == 0:
                pos += 1
        distance += 1
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print('YES' if func_1(a, x, k) else 'NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (n), a threshold value (k), a list of monster healths (a), and a list of monster positions (x). It then calls another function `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if a certain condition is met. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case. The final state of the program consists of these 'YES' or 'NO' outputs for all test cases.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `a` (list of health values), `x` (list of positions), and `k` (number of bullets).
   - It sorts the indices of the monsters based on their distances from the origin (point 0).
   - It iterates through the sorted indices and tries to kill the closest monsters first.
   - If a monster reaches the player's position (point 0), it returns `False`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` and prints "YES" if the player can survive, otherwise "NO".

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Sorting and Distance Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the indices based on the absolute distance from the origin (`abs(x[i])`). This ensures that the closest monsters are processed first.
   - This approach is correct because it allows the player to prioritize killing the closest threats first.

2. **Bullet Management**:
   - The function uses a while loop to manage the bullets. It iterates through the sorted indices and uses up to `k` bullets to reduce the health of the monsters.
   - If a monster's health is reduced to zero, it is considered killed, and the index is moved to the next monster.
   - The function checks if a monster reaches the player's position (point 0) and returns `False` immediately if this happens.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where a monster might be at the same distance as another but still needs to be processed based on the order of sorted indices.
   - The function correctly manages the bullets and ensures that the player can kill the monsters before they reach the player's position.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the player can survive and kill all monsters without letting any of them reach the player's position. The sorting and bullet management logic are sound and handle all the necessary conditions.
