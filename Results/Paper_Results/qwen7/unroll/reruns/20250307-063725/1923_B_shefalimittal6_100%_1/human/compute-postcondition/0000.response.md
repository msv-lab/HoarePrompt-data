Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, obtained from input; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers where each integer represents the health of a monster (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); x is a list of n integers where each integer represents the initial position of a monster (-n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0).**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `a`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
