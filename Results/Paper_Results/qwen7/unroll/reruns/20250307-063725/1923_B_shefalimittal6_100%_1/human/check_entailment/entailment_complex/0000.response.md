### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the logic of the functions to determine if the program correctly solves the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if it is possible to kill all monsters before they reach the player's position (point 0).
   - It sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player (`abs(x[i])`).
   - It iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the closest monsters.
   - If at any point a monster reaches the player's position (i.e., `abs(x[sorted_indices[pos]]) == distance`), the function returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without a monster reaching the player, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of monsters (`n`), the number of bullets per second (`k`), the health of each monster (`a`), and the initial positions of each monster (`x`).
   - It calls `func_1(a, x, k)` to determine if the player can survive.
   - It prints `YES` if `func_1` returns `True`, otherwise it prints `NO`.

### Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`**:
  - The logic in `func_1` is sound. It correctly sorts the monsters by their distance from the player and iteratively reduces their health using the available bullets.
  - The function correctly identifies if any monster reaches the player's position before their health is reduced to zero.
  - The function handles all edge cases, such as when a monster's health is reduced to zero or when no more bullets are available.

- **Function `func_2`**:
  - The function `func_2` correctly processes each test case.
  - It reads the necessary inputs for each test case and calls `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
  - The output is correctly formatted as `YES` or `NO` based on the result of `func_1`.

Given the analysis, both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program correctly determines whether the player can survive and kill all monsters without any logical errors or inconsistencies.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**
