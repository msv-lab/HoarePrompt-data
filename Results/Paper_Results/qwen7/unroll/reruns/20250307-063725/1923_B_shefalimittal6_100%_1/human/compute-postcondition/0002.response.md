Output State: **After executing the loop for all test cases, the output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on the result of `func_1(a, x, k)`. Each 'YES' or 'NO' corresponds to whether the condition specified by `func_1` is met for the given inputs of n, k, a, and x for each test case.**
