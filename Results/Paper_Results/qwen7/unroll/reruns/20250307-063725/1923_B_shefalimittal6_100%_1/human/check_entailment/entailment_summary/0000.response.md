Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible to kill all monsters without any of them reaching the player's starting position (point 0).
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads input and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` sorts the monsters based on their distance from the player, ensuring that the closest monsters are dealt with first. It then iteratively fires bullets to reduce the health of the monsters until either all monsters are killed or a monster reaches the player.
- The logic in `func_1` seems sound:
  - It sorts the monsters by their distance from the player.
  - It iterates through the sorted list, firing bullets to reduce the health of the nearest monsters.
  - It ensures that no monster reaches the player by checking if the distance matches the current iteration step.
- Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, `func_1` correctly determines whether it's possible to survive and kill all monsters.
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the appropriate 'YES' or 'NO' based on the results from `func_1`.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided implementation meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
