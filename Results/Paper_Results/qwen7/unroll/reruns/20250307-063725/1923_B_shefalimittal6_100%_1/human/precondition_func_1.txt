t is an integer representing the number of test cases; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9; a is a list of n integers where each integer represents the health of a monster (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); x is a list of n integers where each integer represents the initial position of a monster (-n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0).
