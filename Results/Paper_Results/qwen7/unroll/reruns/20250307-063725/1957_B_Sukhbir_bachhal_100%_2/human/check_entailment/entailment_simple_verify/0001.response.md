### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and initializes an empty list `arr`.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program proceeds to handle the case where `n` is greater than 1.
   - It calls the function `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function works correctly by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero, counting the shifts.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to `arr`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to `arr`, ensuring the sum of the array equals `k`.
   - It fills the rest of the array with zeros to ensure the length of `arr` is `n`.

3. **Single Element Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`, which is correct since the only element in the array must be `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 1` correctly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the highest bit position of `k`.

6. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The constructed array ensures that the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized because the largest possible value (`2 ** counter - 1`) is used, and the remaining value is appended to ensure the sum constraint is met.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the example outputs, there are some potential issues that need to be addressed:

- **Handling of `counter`**:
  - In the function `func_1`, `counter` is returned as `position - 1`. This means that `2 ** counter - 1` will be the largest power of 2 less than `k`, but not necessarily the exact value needed to maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation.
  - For example, if `k = 5`, `func_1(5)` returns `2`, so `2 ** 2 - 1 = 3`. However, using `3` might not always maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation. A better approach would be to use the exact value of `k` directly when `k` itself is a power of 2.

- **Maximizing the Number of 1s**:
  - The current approach might not always maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation. For instance, if `k = 5` and `n = 2`, the output `[3, 2]` is produced, but `[5, 0]` would be a better choice because `5 | 0 = 5` (which has three 1s in binary), whereas `3 | 2 = 3` (which has two 1s in binary).

### Corrected Approach:
To ensure the number of 1s in the OR operation is maximized, we should consider the following:
- If `k` is a power of 2, we should use `k` directly.
- Otherwise, we should use the largest power of 2 less than `k` and adjust the remaining value accordingly.

Here is a revised version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        if k & (k - 1) == 0:  # Check if k is a power of 2
            arr.append(k)
        else:
            arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
            arr.append(k - (2 ** counter - 1))
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was partially accurate but did not fully address the potential issues with maximizing the number of 1s in the OR operation. The revised approach ensures that the number of 1s is maximized by considering the exact value of `k` when it is a power of 2.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
