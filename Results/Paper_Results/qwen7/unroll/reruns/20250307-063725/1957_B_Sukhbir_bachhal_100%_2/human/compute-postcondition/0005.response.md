Output State: **The variable `n` will be 0 and `position` will be the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `n` is not equal to 0. In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by one bit (`n >>= 1`), which effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the remainder. The `position` variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration. This process continues until `n` becomes 0. The final value of `position` will be the number of bits in the binary representation of the original `n`, which is equivalent to the logarithm base 2 of `n` rounded up to the nearest integer.
