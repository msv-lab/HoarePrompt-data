You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. Additionally, the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: The variable `n` will be 0 and `position` will be the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and initializes an empty list `arr`.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program proceeds to handle the case where `n` is greater than 1.
   - It calls the function `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function works correctly by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero, counting the shifts.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to `arr`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to `arr`, ensuring the sum of the array equals `k`.
   - It fills the rest of the array with zeros to ensure the length of `arr` is `n`.

3. **Single Element Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`, which is correct since the only element in the array must be `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 1` correctly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the highest bit position of `k`.

6. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The constructed array ensures that the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized because the largest possible value (`2 ** counter - 1`) is used, and the remaining value is appended to ensure the sum constraint is met.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. There are no logical errors or issues in the provided code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
