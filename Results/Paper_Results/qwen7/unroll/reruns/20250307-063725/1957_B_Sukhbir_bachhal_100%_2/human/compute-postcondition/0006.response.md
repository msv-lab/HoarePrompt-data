Output State: **The program returns -1**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `n` is set to 0. Right-shifting 0 any number of times will still result in 0. Therefore, `position`, which represents the number of times `n` can be right-shifted until it becomes 0, is 0. The code then returns `position - 1`, which is `0 - 1 = -1`.
