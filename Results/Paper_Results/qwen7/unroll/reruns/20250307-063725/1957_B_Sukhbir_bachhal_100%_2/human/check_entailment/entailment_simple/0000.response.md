Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - For the bitwise OR to have the maximum number of 1s, the goal should be to include numbers with high bit values (powers of 2) in the sequence.
   - If \( n > 1 \), the optimal strategy is to use one number that is a power of 2 minus 1 (to maximize the number of 1s in its binary representation) and another number that complements the sum to \( k \). The rest of the numbers can be set to 0.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \) by printing \( k \) directly.
   - For \( n > 1 \), the code calls `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).
   - `func_1` calculates the position of the highest set bit in \( k \) using right shifts, which is correct.
   - The sequence construction logic is as follows:
     - Append \( 2^{\text{position}} - 1 \) to the array (this number has the maximum number of 1s for its bit length).
     - Append \( k - (2^{\text{position}} - 1) \) to the array to ensure the sum is \( k \).
     - Append \( n-2 \) zeros to complete the sequence.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - The bitwise OR operation will indeed have the maximum number of 1s because \( 2^{\text{position}} - 1 \) has all bits set to 1 up to the \( \text{position} \)-th bit, and the remaining number complements this to ensure the total sum is \( k \).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
