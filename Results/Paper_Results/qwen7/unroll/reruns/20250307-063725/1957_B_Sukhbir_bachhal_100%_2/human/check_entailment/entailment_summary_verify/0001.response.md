### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and initializes an empty list `arr`.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program proceeds to handle the case where `n` is greater than 1.
   - It calls the function `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. However, the function `func_1` is incorrectly summarized. According to the provided function summary, `func_1` always returns `-1`, regardless of the value of `n`. This means `counter` will always be `-1`, leading to `2 ** counter - 1` being `2 ** -1 - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5`, which is not a valid integer.

3. **Handling Invalid `counter` Value**:
   - Since `counter` is `-1`, `arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)` will append `-0.5` to `arr`, which is incorrect. The array should contain non-negative integers.
   - Even if we ignore this issue, `arr.append(k - arr[-1])` would still be problematic because `arr[-1]` would be `-0.5`, leading to a non-integer value for the next element in the array.

4. **Rest of the Array**:
   - The loop `for _ in range(n - 2): arr.append(0)` correctly appends zeros to ensure the array has `n` elements, but the initial invalid values make this step irrelevant.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces, but due to the invalid initial values, the output will be incorrect.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 1` correctly by printing `k`.

7. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The constructed array will not maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR because the initial values are invalid and do not contribute to maximizing the OR result.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error due to the incorrect implementation of the `func_1` function, which always returns `-1`. This leads to the array containing invalid non-integer values, making the program incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
