Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to generate a sequence of integers that satisfy the given conditions.
- The `func_1` function is supposed to find the highest bit position set in the binary representation of `n`. However, the implementation of `func_1` always returns `-1`, which is incorrect.
- If `func_1` returns `-1`, it will incorrectly handle the case when `n > 1` because it will append `2 ** -1 - 1` (which is `0`) and `k - 0` to the array `arr`.
- For `n = 1`, the program correctly prints `k`.

Given the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the overall program logic is flawed and will not produce the correct sequences for most test cases.

Correctness: **False**
