### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` and initializes an empty list `arr`.

2. **Single Element Case**:
   - If `n > 1`, the program proceeds to handle the case where `n` is greater than 1.
   - It calls the function `func_1(k)` to find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function works correctly by right-shifting `k` until it becomes zero, counting the shifts.
   - It then appends `2 ** counter - 1` to `arr`, which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that is less than or equal to `k`.
   - It appends `k - arr[-1]` to `arr`, ensuring the sum of the array equals `k`.
   - It fills the rest of the array with zeros to ensure the length of `arr` is `n`.

3. **Single Element Handling**:
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`, which is correct since the only element in the array must be `k`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the elements of `arr` separated by spaces, which is correct.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n == 1` correctly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the highest bit position of `k`.

6. **Binary OR Operation**:
   - The constructed array ensures that the bitwise OR of the elements is maximized because the largest possible value (`2 ** counter - 1`) is used, and the remaining value is appended to ensure the sum constraint is met.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers that sum to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR. There are no logical errors or issues in the provided code.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
