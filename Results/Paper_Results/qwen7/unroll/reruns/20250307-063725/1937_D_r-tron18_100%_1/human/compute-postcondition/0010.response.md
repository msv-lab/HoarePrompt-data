Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is determined based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. Specifically, for each position `i` in `s1`, the value in `ans[i]` is computed based on the number of trailing zeros and leading ones up to that position, adjusted according to certain conditions involving cumulative sums and counts of characters.**
