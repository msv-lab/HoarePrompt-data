Output State: `totalOne` is equal to 0, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `preOne` is an empty list, `suffZero` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is the cumulative sum of indices for each character '<' in `s1`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.
