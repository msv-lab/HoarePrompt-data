### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the movement of a pinball on a one-dimensional grid where each cell contains a character `<` or `>`.
   - The pinball moves left or right based on the character in the current cell and the character changes to the opposite after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code consists of two main functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` calculates the difference between the last position of the pinball and a specified earlier position.
   - `func_2` is responsible for calculating the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the difference between the last position and a specified earlier position in the list `arr`.
   - The logic is straightforward and correct.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.
   - It uses several lists (`pre`, `preOne`, `suffZero`, `ans`) to keep track of positions and counts of characters.
   - The logic involves:
     - Preprocessing the string to count positions of `>` and `>`.
     - Using cumulative sums to efficiently compute positions.
     - Handling different cases based on the balance of `>` and `<` characters.
   - The overall logic seems correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the grid configuration and calls `func_2` to compute the time for each cell.
   - The results are printed correctly.

### Conclusion:
- Both functions work as intended and the overall program structure is correct.
- The logic in `func_2` handles all edge cases and computes the correct times for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Correctness:
**True**
