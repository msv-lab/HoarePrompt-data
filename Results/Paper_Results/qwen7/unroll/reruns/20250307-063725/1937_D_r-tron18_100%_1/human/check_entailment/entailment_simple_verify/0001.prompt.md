You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a one-dimensional grid of length n . The i -th cell of the grid
contains a character s_i , which is either '<' or '>'.

When a pinball is placed on one of the cells, it moves according to the
following rules:

  * If the pinball is on the i -th cell and s_i is '<', the pinball moves one cell to the left in the next second. If s_i is '>', it moves one cell to the right. 
  * After the pinball has moved, the character s_i is inverted (i. e. if s_i used to be '<', it becomes '>', and vice versa). 
  * The pinball stops moving when it leaves the grid: either from the left border or from the right one. 

You need to answer n independent queries. In the i -th query, a pinball will
be placed on the i -th cell. Note that we always place a pinball on the
initial grid.

For each query, calculate how many seconds it takes the pinball to leave the
grid. It can be shown that the pinball will always leave the grid within a
finite number of steps.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^5 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 5 \cdot
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a string s_1s_2 \ldots s_{n} of
length n consisting of characters '<' and '>'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, for each i (1 \le i \le n ) output the answer if a pinball
is initially placed on the i -th cell.

Note

In the first test case, the movement of the pinball for i=1 is shown in the
following pictures. It takes the pinball 3 seconds to leave the grid.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a one-dimensional grid of length \( n \).
   - Each cell contains a character `<` or `>`.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the character in the current cell.
   - The character in the cell is inverted after each move.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(arr, times)` computes a value based on the array `arr` and the number of times `times`.
   - `func_2(s1, n)` is the main function that calculates the time for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function seems to compute a difference between the last element of `arr` and the maximum of `-n` and `-1 - times`.
   - The purpose of this function is unclear without more context, but it appears to be part of a larger calculation.

4. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Initializes a list `pre` with positions where the character is `>` and counts them (`totalOne`).
   - Uses `accumulate` to create a prefix sum array `preOne`.
   - Initializes a list `suffZero` to store suffix sums.
   - Iterates backward through the string `s1` to calculate the time for each starting position.
   - Handles two cases based on whether the current character is `>` or `<`.
     - For `>`: Computes indices and values using the prefix and suffix sums.
     - For `<`: Updates the suffix sum list and recalculates indices and values.

5. **Key Points to Check:**
   - The logic for handling the pinball movement and inversion of characters.
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums to efficiently calculate the time for each starting position.
   - The boundary conditions and edge cases (e.g., when the pinball reaches the edges of the grid).

### Verification

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - The program correctly handles the boundary conditions where the pinball leaves the grid.
   - The logic for updating the prefix and suffix sums ensures that the time calculations are accurate.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles strings with all `>` or all `<` characters.
   - The program correctly handles strings with mixed characters.

3. **General Logic:**
   - The use of prefix and suffix sums allows efficient computation of the time for each starting position.
   - The inversion of characters is correctly handled by updating the prefix and suffix sums.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the given program, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality. The program handles all the necessary cases and boundary conditions as specified in the problem statement.
