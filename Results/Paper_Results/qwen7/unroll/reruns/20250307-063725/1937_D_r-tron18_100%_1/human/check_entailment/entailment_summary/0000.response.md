Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_2` correctly computes the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each initial cell position.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Each cell in the grid contains either '<' or '>'.
   - A pinball starts at a specific cell and moves left or right based on the direction indicated by the cell.
   - After each move, the direction of the cell is reversed.
   - The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

2. **Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - The function initializes some lists and variables to keep track of positions and counts.
   - It uses cumulative sums (`preOne`) to efficiently compute distances.
   - For each cell, it checks the direction ('<' or '>') and calculates the time to exit the grid based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters.
   - The logic seems to handle both cases (moving left or right) and correctly accounts for the changes in direction.

3. **Key Points:**
   - The function correctly handles the reversal of directions.
   - It uses efficient accumulation techniques to compute distances.
   - The logic for calculating the time to exit the grid appears to be sound, considering the balance of directions and the cumulative sums.

Given the detailed implementation and the explanation of the logic, the function `func_2` appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
