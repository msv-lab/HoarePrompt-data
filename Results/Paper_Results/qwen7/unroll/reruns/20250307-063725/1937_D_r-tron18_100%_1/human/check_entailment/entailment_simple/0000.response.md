### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the string `s1` and calculates the time it takes for a pinball starting from each cell to leave the grid.
   - It uses two lists, `pre` and `suffZero`, to store the cumulative sums of indices where the direction changes from `<` to `>` and `>` to `<`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `s1` in reverse order and calculates the time for each cell using the precomputed values stored in `preOne` and `suffZero`.
   - The calculations involve finding the appropriate indices in `preOne` and `suffZero` to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function computes the difference between the last position of the pinball and its position at a given index.
   - The formula `arr[-1] - arr[max(-n, -1 - times)]` correctly computes this difference, ensuring that the index is within bounds.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` appears to correctly handle the movement and inversion of directions for the pinball.
   - The use of cumulative sums (`preOne` and `suffZero`) ensures that the time calculation is efficient.
   - The handling of boundary conditions (left and right edges of the grid) seems to be correctly managed.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output is a list of times for each cell, which matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the logic in the functions `func_1` and `func_2` appears to be correct. The code handles the movement of the pinball, the inversion of directions, and the calculation of the time to leave the grid correctly.

### Correctness:

**True**
