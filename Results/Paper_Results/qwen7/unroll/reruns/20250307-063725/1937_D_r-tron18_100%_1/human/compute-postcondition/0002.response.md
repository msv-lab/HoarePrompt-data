Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, and `pre` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` up to that index, starting with 0. This means that `preOne[i]` will be the sum of all elements in `pre` from the start up to index `i`. The initial state of `totalOne` being equal to the length of `pre` and `s1` being a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>' remains unchanged. The list `pre` itself is not modified.
