The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `s1`, which is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `n`, which is the length of the string `s1` and is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information, but based on typical string manipulation functions, it might evaluate the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string. However, since no specific return values are mentioned, we can only describe the parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It evaluates the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.**
