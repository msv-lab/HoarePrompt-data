### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- This function calculates the difference between the last position of the pinball and the position at the maximum of the last index of `arr` and `times - 1`.
- While the function itself seems logically correct, it doesn't directly relate to the pinball simulation logic.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` attempts to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid.
- It initializes several lists:
  - `pre`: List of positions where the character is `'>'.`
  - `totalOne`: Total count of positions where the character is `'>'.`
  - `preOne`: Cumulative sum of positions where the character is `'>'.`
  - `suffZero`: List of cumulative sums of positions where the character is `'<'`.
- The function iterates backward through the string `s1` and calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid based on the balance of `'>` and `'<'` characters.
- The logic involves complex accumulations and does not directly simulate the movement and inversion of the characters as described in the problem.

#### Key Issues:
1. **Inversion Handling**: The function does not handle the inversion of characters correctly. The pinball should change direction when it hits a cell with a different character, but the current logic does not account for this.
2. **Movement Simulation**: The function does not simulate the movement of the pinball step-by-step. Instead, it attempts to calculate the time based on the balance of characters, which is not equivalent to the actual movement.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases where the pinball might get stuck in a loop or where the grid configuration makes the pinball leave the grid in a non-trivial manner.

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly simulate the movement and inversion of the pinball as required by the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not accurately simulate the movement and inversion of the pinball as described in the problem.
