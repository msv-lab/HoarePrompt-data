Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and `pre` is a list of integers where each integer i+1 is the position index (1-indexed) of '>' in `s1`.**

Explanation: The code `totalOne = len(pre)` calculates the length of the list `pre` and assigns it to the variable `totalOne`. The values of `s1` and `pre` remain unchanged from their initial state.
