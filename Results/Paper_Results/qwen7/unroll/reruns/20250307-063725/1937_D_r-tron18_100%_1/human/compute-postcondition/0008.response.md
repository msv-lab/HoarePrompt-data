Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `totalOne` is equal to 0.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `preOne` is an empty list.
   - `suffZero` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is the cumulative sum of indices for each character '<' in `s1`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Understanding `ans`:**
   - Since `ans` is a list of length `n` and each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop, we need to understand what those conditions might be. However, the exact conditions are not provided in the initial state. Typically, such a list would be populated during a loop that processes the string `s1`.

4. **Output:**
   - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.

Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for the elements of `ans`. Therefore, the output will be a list of `n` elements, but without knowing the exact values, we can only describe it in terms of the structure.

Output: **a list of n elements, where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop (the exact values depend on the processing of the string s1)**
