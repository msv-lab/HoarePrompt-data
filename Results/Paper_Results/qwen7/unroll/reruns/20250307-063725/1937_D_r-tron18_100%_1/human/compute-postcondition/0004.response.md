Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `preOne` is a list of cumulative sums starting from 0 where each element is the sum of all previous elements in `pre` including itself, and `pre` remains unchanged; `suffZero` is a list containing only the value 0; `ans` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` zeros. This means that `ans` is now a list of length `n` where every element is 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
