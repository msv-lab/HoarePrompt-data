You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 is a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and '>', and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5.
def func_2(s1, n):
    pre = [(i + 1) for i, el in enumerate(s1) if el == '>']
    totalOne = len(pre)
    preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))
    suffZero = [0]
    ans = [0] * n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        el = s1[i]
        
        if el == '>':
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if ol <= zr:

            preOne.pop()
            totalOne -= 1
        else:
            suffZero.append(suffZero[-1] + i + 1)
            ol, zr = totalOne, len(suffZero) - 1
            if zr <= ol:
                zeroInd = suffZero[-1] + suffZero[-2]
                oneInd = 2 * func_1(preOne, zr)
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd + n + 1
            else:
                zeroInd = 2 * func_1(suffZero, ol + 1) - func_1(suffZero, 1)
                oneInd = 2 * preOne[-1]
                ans[i] = zeroInd - oneInd
        
    #State: Output State: `totalOne` is equal to 0, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `preOne` is an empty list, `suffZero` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is the cumulative sum of indices for each character '<' in `s1`, and `ans` is a list of length `n` where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: - The `print(*ans)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans` separated by spaces.
    #
    #Given the initial state, we don't have specific values for the elements of `ans`. Therefore, the output will be a list of `n` elements, but without knowing the exact values, we can only describe it in terms of the structure.
    #
    #Output:
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>', and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It evaluates the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s1`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
