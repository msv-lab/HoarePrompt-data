The function accepts a list of integers `arr` representing the positions of the pinball on the grid after each second, and an integer `times` indicating the initial cell index. It calculates and returns the difference between the last position of the pinball in the list `arr` and the position of the pinball at the maximum of the last index of `arr` and the index `times - 1`.
