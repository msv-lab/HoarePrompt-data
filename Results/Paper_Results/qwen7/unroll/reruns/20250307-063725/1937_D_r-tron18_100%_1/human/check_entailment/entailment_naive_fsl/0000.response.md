Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the movement of the pinball according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_2` seems to be attempting to calculate the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid, but it does not properly handle the inversion of the characters and the movement logic.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- Input: `n = 3`, `s = "<><"`
- Expected Output: `1 4 7`
- Actual Output: The program does not produce the expected output.

The issue lies in the way the function calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid. The function uses complex accumulations and does not correctly simulate the movement and inversion of the characters. For instance, when the pinball reaches a cell with `'><'`, it should invert the direction but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

A correct solution would involve simulating the movement step-by-step, keeping track of the position and direction of the pinball, and updating the grid accordingly until the pinball leaves the grid. The provided code does not implement this logic correctly.
