Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities but uses an incorrect approach. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is not appropriate for finding the next occurrence of the sign.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to iteratively find the next occurrence of each sign based on the previous one. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        current_year = 0
        for x in nums:
            current_year += x * ((current_year // x) + 1)
            while current_year % x != 0:
                current_year += x
        print(current_year)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
1. **Initialization**: Start with `current_year` set to 0.
2. **Iterate through each sign**: For each sign, update `current_year` to the next occurrence of that sign after the previous sign has occurred.
3. **Update `current_year`**: Add the periodicity `x` times the number of full cycles plus one (`(current_year // x) + 1`) to `current_year`.
4. **Ensure exact match**: Ensure `current_year` is a multiple of `x` by adding `x` until it is.
5. **Print result**: After processing all signs, print `current_year`.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
