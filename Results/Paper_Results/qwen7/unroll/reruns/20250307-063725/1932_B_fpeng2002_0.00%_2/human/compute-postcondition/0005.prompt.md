You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case specified by the input integer `num_tests`, the code calculates a value for `start_year` based on the list of integers provided as input. The calculation involves iterating over the list of integers and applying a specific formula to determine `start_year`. After processing all test cases, the output consists of the final `start_year` value for each test case printed in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of sub-cases, followed by `t` groups of data. Each group contains a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each group, the function performs some unspecified operation and returns different results based on the processed data.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
