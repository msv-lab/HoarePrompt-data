### Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program correctly reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`).
3. **Initialization**: The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0. This variable is intended to track the current year in which the last sign occurred.
4. **Loop Through Signs**: The loop iterates through each sign's periodicity. However, the logic used to update `start_year` is flawed.
   - The current line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is attempting to find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than `start_year`. However, this approach does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the signs.
   - Specifically, the formula should be `start_year = (start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] * nums[x]` to ensure that `start_year` is the smallest multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than or equal to `start_year`.
5. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `start_year`, which should be the year when the nth sign occurs.

### Correctness:
The given program is incorrect because the logic to update `start_year` is flawed. It does not correctly compute the next year when the next sign will occur sequentially.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, n):
            start_year = (start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] * nums[x]
        print(start_year)
```

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
