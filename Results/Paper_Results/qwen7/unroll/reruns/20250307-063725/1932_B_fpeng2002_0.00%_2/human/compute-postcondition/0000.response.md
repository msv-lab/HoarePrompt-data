Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, and `a_i` remain as they were before the input.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. It does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or the list `a_i`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain unchanged.
