Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`).
3. It initializes `start_year` to 0, which is the base year from which the calculations start.
4. The loop iterates over the periodicities and updates `start_year` to ensure it aligns with the next sign's occurrence. This is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{start\_year} = \left(\left(\text{start\_year} + 1\right) // \text{nums}[x] + 1\right) * \text{nums}[x]
   \]
   This formula ensures that `start_year` is the smallest year that is a multiple of `nums[x]` and is greater than or equal to `start_year + 1`.
5. After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final `start_year` is printed, which is the year when the nth sign will occur.
6. The program correctly handles the constraints and logic required to solve the problem.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
