Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the loop where `start_year` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly compute the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one has occurred. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  3 2 4
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The first sign occurs in year 3.
  - The second sign occurs strictly after the first, so it occurs in year 5 (since 3 + 2 = 5).
  - The third sign occurs strictly after the second, so it occurs in year 9 (since 5 + 4 = 9).

- Program Output:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the year as 4.

This shows that the program does not handle the sequential occurrence of signs correctly, thus it is incorrect.
