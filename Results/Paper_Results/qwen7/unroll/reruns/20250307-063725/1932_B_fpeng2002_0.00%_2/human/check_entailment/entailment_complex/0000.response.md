Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and then iterates through each test case.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`).
   - It reads the periodicities of the signs (`nums`).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through each periodicity in `nums` and updates `start_year` to the next year when all signs will occur sequentially.
3. **Updating `start_year`**:
   - For each periodicity `a_i`, `start_year` is updated to the smallest year greater than or equal to `start_year + 1` that is a multiple of `a_i`.
   - This is achieved by the expression `((start_year + 1) // a_i + 1) * a_i`, which ensures that `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of `a_i` with the previous `start_year`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the annotated program correctly calculates the year when the nth sign will occur for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
