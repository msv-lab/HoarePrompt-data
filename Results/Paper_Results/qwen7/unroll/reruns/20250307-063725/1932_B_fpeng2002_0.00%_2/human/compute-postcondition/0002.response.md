Output State: The output state will consist of `num_tests` lines, each containing an integer value representing `start_year` for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case (indicated by the value of `num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `nums`. It then calculates the value of `start_year` based on the formula provided within the loop. After calculating `start_year` for each test case, it prints the result. Therefore, the final output state will be a series of integers, one for each test case, representing the calculated `start_year` values.
