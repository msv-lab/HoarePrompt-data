Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case specified by the input integer `num_tests`, the code calculates a value for `start_year` based on the list of integers provided as input. The calculation involves iterating over the list of integers and applying a specific formula to determine `start_year`. After processing all test cases, the output consists of the final `start_year` value for each test case printed in sequence.
