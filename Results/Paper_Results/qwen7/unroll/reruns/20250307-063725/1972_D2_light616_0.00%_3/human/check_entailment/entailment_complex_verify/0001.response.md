### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for iterating over \(x\) and \(y\) seems correct.
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked correctly.
   - However, the increment operation `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is problematic. This operation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs because it assumes that the minimum value will always be an integer, which is not necessarily true. Moreover, the division operations might lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic for reading test cases and calling `func_1` is correct.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples match the expected output, but this does not guarantee the correctness of the logic, especially for more complex cases.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like when \(n\) or \(m\) is 1 correctly.
   - However, the handling of larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) might still have issues due to the problematic increment operation.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the increment operation `cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is flawed. This operation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs and might lead to incorrect results due to floating-point precision issues and the assumption that the minimum value will always be an integer.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
