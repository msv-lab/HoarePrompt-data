Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and \(1 \leq y \leq \sqrt{m}\). For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and calculates the minimum value between \(n / ((x + y) * x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\). This ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
