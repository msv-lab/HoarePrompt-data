### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for iterating over \(x\) and \(y\) seems correct.
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked correctly.
   - The count is incremented using the minimum value of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\), which ensures that the count is not overestimated.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic for reading test cases and calling `func_1` is correct.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples match the expected output, indicating that the logic is correct.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like when \(n\) or \(m\) is 1 correctly.
   - The function also handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) within the constraints.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to increment the count. Specifically, the expression \(\min\left(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}, \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\right)\) does not accurately represent the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). Instead, it should be counting the number of valid pairs directly.

### Detailed Analysis:

- The expression \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) are not correct because they do not account for the actual number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

- The correct approach would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective bounds and checking the condition directly.

### Corrected Approach:

A more accurate approach would be to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition directly:

```python
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)
```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is incorrect because the logic used to increment the count is flawed. The provided solution does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
