You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: cnt is the sum of min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) where x * x <= n, (x + y) * x <= n, and (x + y) * y <= m, with gcd(x, y) == 1.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y)) for all pairs (x, y) satisfying the given conditions)

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(1 \leq x \leq \sqrt{n}\) and \(1 \leq y \leq \sqrt{m}\). For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and calculates the minimum value between \(n / ((x + y) * x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\). This ensures that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs for each test case. There are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
