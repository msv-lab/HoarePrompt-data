Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x^2 \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \).
   - For each valid pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\). If true, it adds the minimum value of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) to the count `cnt`.
   - This ensures that the condition \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) is a multiple of \( a + b \) is checked correctly.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case, passing the values of \( n \) and \( m \).
   - This ensures that the main logic of counting valid pairs is applied to each test case.

3. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by reading \( t \) and then processing each test case individually.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is designed to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the specified conditions.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
