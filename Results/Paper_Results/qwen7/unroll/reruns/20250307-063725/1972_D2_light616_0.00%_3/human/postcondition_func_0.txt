The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from input, then calculates and prints the sum of the minimum values between \( \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \) and \( \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \) for all pairs of positive integers \( (x, y) \) that satisfy the conditions \( x \cdot x \leq n \), \( (x + y) \cdot x \leq n \), and \( (x + y) \cdot y \leq m \), with the greatest common divisor of \( x \) and \( y \) being 1. The function returns nothing.
