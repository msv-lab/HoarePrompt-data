Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The provided code consists of two functions:
  - `func_1()`: This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) using a nested loop to iterate over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\). It checks the conditions \(x \cdot x \leq n\), \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\), and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), and ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If these conditions are met, it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) to the count.
  - `func_2()`: This function reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it calls `func_1()` to process the input \(n\) and \(m\).

Given the problem statement and the execution summaries of the functions, the implementation of `func_1()` appears to correctly calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). The nested loops and the gcd check ensure that only valid pairs are counted. The outer loop in `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases.

Therefore, the provided code meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
