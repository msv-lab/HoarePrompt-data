### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts from 1 and goes up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The outer loop runs for \(x\) from 1 to \(\lfloor \sqrt{n} \rfloor\).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - The inner loop runs for \(y\) from 1 to the point where \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it adds the minimum value of \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\) to `cnt`.

4. **Output**:
   - After the loops complete, `cnt` is printed, which represents the total count of valid pairs.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   
2. **Loop for Test Cases**:
   - For each test case, `func_1` is called to process the values of \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **State Before `func_1` Call**:
  - `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
  
- **State After `func_1` Execution**:
  - `cnt` contains the count of valid pairs for the current test case.
  
- **State After `func_2` Execution**:
  - The program processes `t` test cases, and for each test case, it prints the count of valid pairs.

### Evaluation:
1. **Logic Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly checks for pairs \((x, y)\) such that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and ensures that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(\sqrt{m}\) in the loops is efficient for checking pairs within the given constraints.
   - The calculation of the minimum value ensures that the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is satisfied.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and ensures that the product of \(n\) and \(m\) does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).
   - The use of integer division (`//`) and floating-point division (`/`) ensures that the calculations are correct.

3. **Multiple Test Cases**:
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case, ensuring that the output is accurate for each case.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the program to fail for any input within the specified constraints.

**Final: True**

The original assessment is accurate.
