Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \cdot x \leq n\), \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\), and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). For each valid pair \((x, y)\) where \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\) to the count. This approach ensures that all conditions specified in the problem statement are met.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. Since `func_1()` is designed to handle individual test cases correctly, and `func_2()` simply repeats this process for each test case, the overall solution is correct.

Given that both functions together correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
