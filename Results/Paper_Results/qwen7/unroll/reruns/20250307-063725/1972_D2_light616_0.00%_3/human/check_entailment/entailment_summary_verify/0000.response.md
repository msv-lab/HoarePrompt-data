### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Purpose**: The function aims to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
2. **Logic**:
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{m}\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If the condition is met, it adds the minimum of \(n / ((x + y) * x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) * y)\) to the count.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Purpose**: The function processes multiple test cases.
2. **Logic**:
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\).
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1`.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The problem requires counting pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The solution should handle up to \(10^4\) test cases, with \(n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Range of \(x\) and \(y\)**:
   - The ranges for \(x\) and \(y\) are set to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(\sqrt{m}\) respectively. This is a reasonable optimization because \(\gcd(a, b)\) will be at most \(\min(a, b)\), and checking up to \(\sqrt{n}\) and \(\sqrt{m}\) ensures that we cover all possible pairs without unnecessary computations.
   
2. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is checked using \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). This is correct because if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = b \cdot 1 = b\), and \(b\) must be a multiple of \(a + b\), which simplifies to checking if \(b\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is a way to ensure that the product \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is indeed a multiple of \(a + b\).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints well and does not have any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid ordered pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The function summaries accurately describe the behavior of the functions. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided function summaries.
