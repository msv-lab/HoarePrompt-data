### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - For each \(x\), it iterates over possible values of \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for iterating over \(x\) and \(y\) seems correct.
   - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked correctly.
   - However, the way the count is incremented is problematic. Specifically, the expression \(\min\left(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}, \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y}\right)\) does not necessarily count the number of valid pairs. Instead, it should be checking if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) directly.

4. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The logic for reading test cases and calling `func_1` is correct.

5. **Testing with Examples:**
   - The provided examples match the expected output, but this does not guarantee the correctness of the logic. The examples might be insufficient to cover all edge cases and potential logical errors.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases like when \(n\) or \(m\) is 1 correctly.
   - However, the function does not handle cases where \(\gcd(x, y) \neq 1\) correctly. The current logic assumes that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is sufficient, which is not always true.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\) directly. This involves iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the logic for counting valid pairs is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in counting valid pairs.
