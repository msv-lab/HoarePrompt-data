Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. There are several issues with the logic in `func_1`:

1. **Incorrect Condition for GCD**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` checks if `x` and `y` are coprime, but the problem requires checking if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. This condition should be checked directly using the properties of the greatest common divisor.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**: The current logic calculates the minimum value between `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)`, which does not correctly count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

3. **Efficiency Issues**: The current approach is inefficient and will not handle large values of `n` and `m` within the given constraints.

To fix these issues, we need to correctly implement the logic to check the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b` and efficiently count the valid pairs. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
import math

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    print(cnt)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

# Function to run the solution
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness and efficiency for the given constraints.
