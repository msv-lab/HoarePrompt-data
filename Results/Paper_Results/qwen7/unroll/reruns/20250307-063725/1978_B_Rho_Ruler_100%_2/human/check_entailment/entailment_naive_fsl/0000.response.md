Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit based on the given problem description. The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit. For each potential \( k \), it calculates the profit using the helper function `func_1`, which accurately computes the total profit based on the given conditions. The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently, considering all possible values from 0 to \(\min(n, b)\). Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution handles all potential cases correctly, making it a valid implementation.
