Output State: **max_profit is the maximum value of profit calculated by `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any mid within the range [0, b].**

Explanation: The loop is designed to find the maximum profit by iteratively narrowing down the range of possible `mid` values using binary search. The variable `max_profit` keeps track of the highest profit found during these iterations. The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, meaning the optimal `mid` value has been identified. The final value of `max_profit` will be the highest profit achievable based on the given parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`.
