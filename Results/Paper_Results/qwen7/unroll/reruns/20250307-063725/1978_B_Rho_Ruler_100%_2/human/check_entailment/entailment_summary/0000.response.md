### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal `k` such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the rest at the usual price `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
   - This formula correctly accounts for the revenue from the first `k` buns sold at the modified prices and the remaining `n-k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range by checking the profit for the midpoint `mid` and comparing it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater, it means increasing `k` could lead to higher profit, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1` to explore lower values of `k`.

4. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search ensures that we efficiently find the maximum profit by evaluating the profit at the midpoint and adjusting the search range accordingly.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that all possible values of `k` are considered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases like when `k` is 0 (all buns sold at the usual price) and when `k` equals `n` (all buns sold at the modified price).

Given the correct implementation of both functions and the logic used in `func_2` to find the optimal `k`, the program should correctly compute the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.
