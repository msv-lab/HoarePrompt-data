### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotional conditions. The key is to find the optimal number of buns \( k \) to sell at the modified price.

2. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - The formula used is: \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
   - This formula correctly accounts for the revenue from the first \( k \) buns sold at the modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns sold at the usual price.

3. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range using binary search until it finds the maximum profit.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit using `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` and compares it with the profit of the next possible \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is higher, it updates `low` to \( mid + 1 \); otherwise, it updates `high` to \( mid - 1 \).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where \( k = 0 \) by considering the usual price for all buns.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently within the range \( [0, \min(n, b)] \).

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in both functions is sound and correctly implements the required algorithm.
   - The binary search approach ensures that the maximum profit is found efficiently.
   - The formula used in `func_1` accurately calculates the profit for any given \( k \).

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
