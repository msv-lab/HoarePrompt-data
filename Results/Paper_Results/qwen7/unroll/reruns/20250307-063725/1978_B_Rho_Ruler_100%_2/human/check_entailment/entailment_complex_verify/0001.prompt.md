You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: k is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b), n is an integer representing the number of buns, a is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and b is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
def func_1(k, n, a, b):
    return k * b - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a
    #The program returns the value of \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \)

It calculates and returns the value of \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \). This formula represents a specific computation involving the integers `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is constrained by the range from 0 to the minimum of `n` and `b`.

    #The program returns the maximum value of profit calculated by `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any mid within the range [0, b].
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It then calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the buns using the `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` function for any midpoint `mid` within the range [0, `b`].




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns where the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns and adds the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series for the modified prices and the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range using binary search until `low` exceeds `high`.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.

4. **Binary Search Validity:**
   - The binary search approach is valid because the profit function is unimodal (it increases initially and then decreases after reaching a peak).
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum profit by checking both \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \) and adjusting the search range based on which yields a higher profit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as \( k = 0 \) and \( k = n \) correctly.
   - The function `func_1` and the binary search logic in `func_2` are consistent and cover all possible values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit. Both functions work as intended, and the binary search efficiently finds the optimal \( k \).
