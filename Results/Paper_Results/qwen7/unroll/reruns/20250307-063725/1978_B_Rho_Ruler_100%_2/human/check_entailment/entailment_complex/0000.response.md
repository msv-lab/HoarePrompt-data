### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given `k` using the formula: 
     \[
     k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula correctly computes the total profit considering the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price and the rest at the usual price.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
   - It iteratively calculates the profit for the middle point `mid` and compares it with the profit for `mid + 1`.
   - If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater, it updates `low` to `mid + 1`; otherwise, it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

3. **Binary Search Validity**:
   - The binary search approach is appropriate because the profit function is unimodal (it increases initially and then decreases).
   - The search space is bounded by `[0, min(n, b)]`, which is reasonable given the constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases like `k = 0` (selling all buns at the usual price) and `k = min(n, b)` (selling the first few buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price).

5. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2` with the appropriate parameters.
   - The logic for reading input and output is correct and matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
