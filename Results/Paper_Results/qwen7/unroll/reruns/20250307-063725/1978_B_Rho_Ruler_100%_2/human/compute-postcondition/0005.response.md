Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. The function returns the maximum value of profit calculated by `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` for any mid within the range [0, b].**

This means the function calculates the maximum profit by varying the number of buns sold at the modified price (`mid`), where `mid` ranges from 0 to `b`, and uses the `func_1` function to compute the profit for each possible value of `mid`.
