The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It then calculates and returns the maximum profit that can be achieved by selling the buns using the `func_1(mid, n, a, b)` function for any midpoint `mid` within the range [0, `b`].
