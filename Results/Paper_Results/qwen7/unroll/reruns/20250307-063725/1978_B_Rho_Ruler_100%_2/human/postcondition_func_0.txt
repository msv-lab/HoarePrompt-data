The function accepts four parameters: `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates and returns the value of \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \). This formula represents a specific computation involving the integers `k`, `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `k` is constrained by the range from 0 to the minimum of `n` and `b`.
