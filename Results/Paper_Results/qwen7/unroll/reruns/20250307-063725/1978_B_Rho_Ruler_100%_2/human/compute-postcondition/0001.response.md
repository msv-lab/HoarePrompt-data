Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of buns, `a` is a positive integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is a positive integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_profit` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, or `high`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
