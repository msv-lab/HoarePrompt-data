### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns where the first \( k \) buns are sold at a modified price and the remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - The modified price for the \( i \)-th bun (where \( 1 \le i \le k \)) is \( b - i + 1 \).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns and adds the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the sum of an arithmetic series for the modified prices and the usual price for the remaining buns.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range using binary search until `low` exceeds `high`.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for \( k = mid \) and \( k = mid + 1 \).
   - It updates `max_profit` with the higher of the two profits and adjusts the search range accordingly.

4. **Binary Search Validity:**
   - The binary search approach is valid because the profit function is unimodal (it increases initially and then decreases after reaching a peak).
   - The function correctly identifies the maximum profit by checking both \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \) and adjusting the search range based on which yields a higher profit.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as \( k = 0 \) and \( k = n \) correctly.
   - The function `func_1` and the binary search logic in `func_2` are consistent and cover all possible values of \( k \).

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit. Both functions work as intended, and the binary search efficiently finds the optimal \( k \).
