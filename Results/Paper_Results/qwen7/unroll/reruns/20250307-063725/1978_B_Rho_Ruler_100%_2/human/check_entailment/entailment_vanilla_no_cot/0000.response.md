Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements an approach to find the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given value of \( k \).
   - It uses the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It initializes the search range with `low = 0` and `high = \(\min(n, b)\)`.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range using binary search until it finds the optimal \( k \).

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - For each midpoint \( \text{mid} \), it calculates the profit for both \( \text{mid} \) and \( \text{mid} + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( \text{mid} + 1 \) is greater, it updates the lower bound (`low`) to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it updates the upper bound (`high`) to `mid - 1`.
   - The loop continues until the optimal \( k \) is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) (selling all buns at the usual price) and \( k = \min(n, b) \) (selling the first \( k \) buns at the modified price and the rest at the usual price).

Given the correct implementation of the logic and handling of edge cases, the provided program is correct.
