Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner**: The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The problem can be solved using the concept of Nim-sum (bitwise XOR of all pile sizes). If the Nim-sum of the pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

2. **Unnecessary Sorting and Duplicates Removal**: The code sorts the array and removes duplicates, which is unnecessary for solving this problem. We only need the unique values of the piles.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Piles**: The code incorrectly calculates the difference between consecutive elements and uses it to determine the winner, which does not align with the Nim-sum strategy.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        nim_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            nim_sum ^= pile
        if nim_sum == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This version correctly computes the Nim-sum of the pile sizes and determines the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.
