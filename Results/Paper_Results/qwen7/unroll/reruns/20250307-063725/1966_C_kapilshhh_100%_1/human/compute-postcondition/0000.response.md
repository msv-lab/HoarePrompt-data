Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases, and all other variables are not yet defined.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases (`tc`). All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning they are not yet defined or assigned any values.
