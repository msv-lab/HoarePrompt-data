Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly calculates the winning condition based on the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted unique pile sizes. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
3
2
1 2
2
2 2
1
1
```

- Expected Output:
```
Alice
Alice
Bob
```

However, the program outputs:
```
Alice
Alice
Alice
```

This is incorrect because in the third test case, after Alice removes 1 stone from the only pile, the remaining pile has 0 stones, making Bob unable to make a move and thus Bob should win. The program fails to correctly determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy for both players.
