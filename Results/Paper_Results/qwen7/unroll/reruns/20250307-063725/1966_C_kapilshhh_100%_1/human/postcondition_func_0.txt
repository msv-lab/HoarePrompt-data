The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial number of stones in each pile. It then sorts this list in descending order, removes duplicates, and appends a zero. The function checks if the difference between any two consecutive elements in the list is exactly 1. If such a pair is found, it sets a boolean `dp` to `False`; otherwise, `dp` remains `True`. Finally, it prints "Alice" if `dp` is `True`, indicating that no two consecutive elements differ by exactly 1, or "Bob" if `dp` is `False`. The function continues this process for all test cases until all test cases are processed.
