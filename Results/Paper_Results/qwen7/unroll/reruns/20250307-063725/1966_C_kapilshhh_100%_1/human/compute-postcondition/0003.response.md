Output State: The output state will be a series of strings either "Alice" or "Bob", each corresponding to the result of one test case's execution within the loop.

Explanation: For each test case (`tc`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of integers from the user. It then sorts this list in descending order, removes duplicates, appends a zero, and initializes a boolean `dp` to `True`. A loop checks if the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1 or if `dp` is `False`. If the condition is met for any pair of consecutive elements, `dp` remains `True`; otherwise, it becomes `False`. Finally, it prints "Alice" if `dp` is still `True`, indicating that no two consecutive elements differ by exactly 1, or "Bob" if `dp` is `False`. After processing each test case, `tc` is decremented until it reaches 0, at which point all test cases have been processed.
