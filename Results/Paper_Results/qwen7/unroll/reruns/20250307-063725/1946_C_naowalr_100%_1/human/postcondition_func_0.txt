The function processes multiple sets of input data where each set contains integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and edges defined by pairs \( (v, u) \). It calls the `solve()` function for each set of input data without modifying any external state variables. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs results based on the processing of the input data. The only variable that retains its initial state is \( t \), which is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t \leq 10^4 \).
