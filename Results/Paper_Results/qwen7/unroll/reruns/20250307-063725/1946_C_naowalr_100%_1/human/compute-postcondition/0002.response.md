Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. After executing the loop, t remains unchanged, and no new variables or states are introduced within the loop. Each iteration of the loop calls the `solve()` function with input data, but the loop itself does not modify any external state variables. Therefore, the only variable that retains its initial state is t.
