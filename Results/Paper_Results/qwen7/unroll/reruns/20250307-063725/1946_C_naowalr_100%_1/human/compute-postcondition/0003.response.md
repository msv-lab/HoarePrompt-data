Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each set of input data, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and for each edge described by `v` and `u`, 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n. The sum of the values of `n` for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5. The function returns information based on this input data.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of inputs structured as described, processes them, and returns some form of output based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
