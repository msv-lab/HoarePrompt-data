Output State: t is reduced to 0. The variable `solve()` is called multiple times based on the value of `t`, but the exact state after all calls cannot be determined without knowing the implementation of `solve()`. The sum of the values of n for all sets of input data does not exceed 10^5, and the values of n and k for each set are within specified bounds.
