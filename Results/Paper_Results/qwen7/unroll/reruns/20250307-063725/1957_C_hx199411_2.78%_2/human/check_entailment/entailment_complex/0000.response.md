Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \), and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), followed by \( k \) pairs of coordinates \( (r_i, c_i) \). This part of the program is correct.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program correctly identifies whether the coordinates \( (r_i, c_i) \) are mirrored (i.e., \( r_i = c_i \)) and counts them. If the coordinates are mirrored, it increments `num` by 1; otherwise, it increments `num` by 2. This logic is correct.

3. **Calculation of Remaining Moves**: The variable `m` is calculated as \( m = n - num \). This calculation is correct because it represents the number of remaining positions where rooks can be placed without attacking each other.

4. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The program initializes a DP array `dp` to store intermediate results. The base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are correctly set to 1 and 3, respectively. The recurrence relation for the DP array is also correct, as it accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that all calculations are taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \), which is necessary to handle large numbers and prevent overflow.

6. **Output**: The program correctly prints the result for each test case, which is derived from the DP array.

Given that the program follows the problem statement accurately and performs the required calculations correctly, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
