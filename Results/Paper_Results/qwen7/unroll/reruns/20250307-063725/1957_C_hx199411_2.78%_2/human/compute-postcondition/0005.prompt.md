You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The moves are represented as pairs (r_i, c_i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and these moves are valid according to the problem statement.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(0)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed based on the input values provided within each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: Each iteration of the while loop processes a set of inputs (`n`, `k`, and subsequent pairs of integers `c` and `r`). Based on these inputs, it calculates a value `m` which is then used to compute and print a result using dynamic programming. The final output is a sequence of printed integers, each corresponding to the computed value of `dp[m]` for each input set processed by the loop. The exact values printed depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` (1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
