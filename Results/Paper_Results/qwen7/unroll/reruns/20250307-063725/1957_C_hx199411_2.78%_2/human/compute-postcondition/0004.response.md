Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` pairs of integers `(n, k)` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 0 ≤ k ≤ n), and `k` pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` (1 ≤ i ≤ k, 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer `t`, followed by `t` sets of integers `(n, k)`, and then `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`. The function does not return a single value but processes these inputs to generate outputs for each test case as specified by the problem statement.
