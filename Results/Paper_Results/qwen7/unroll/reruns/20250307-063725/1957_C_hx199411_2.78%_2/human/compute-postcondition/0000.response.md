Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property, being an integer within the specified range. The other parts of the initial state, specifically regarding `n` and `k`, and their constraints, remain unaffected by this line of code.
