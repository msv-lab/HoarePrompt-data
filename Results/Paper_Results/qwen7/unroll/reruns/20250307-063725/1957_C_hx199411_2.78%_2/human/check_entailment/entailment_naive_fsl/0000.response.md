Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the number of remaining positions (`m`) is greater than 2. Specifically, the dynamic programming approach used in the `dp` array is only correctly implemented for `m` up to 2. For larger values of `m`, the formula `(dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` does not accurately represent the number of possible configurations.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  1 2
  2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - The initial state after the first two moves (you placed a white rook at (1, 2), and the computer mirrored it to (2, 1)) and the second two moves (you placed a white rook at (2, 3), and the computer mirrored it to (3, 2)) leaves us with a 4x4 grid where rows 1 and 2, and columns 1 and 2 are occupied. This leaves us with 2 rows and 2 columns available, i.e., `m = 2`.
  - The correct number of configurations for `m = 2` should be 3, as explained in the note section of the problem statement.

However, the program calculates the number of configurations using the dynamic programming approach, which is incorrect for `m > 2`. The correct approach would involve a more complex combinatorial calculation for larger values of `m`.

Since the program does not correctly handle the case where `m > 2`, it fails to provide the correct output for certain inputs, making it incorrect.
