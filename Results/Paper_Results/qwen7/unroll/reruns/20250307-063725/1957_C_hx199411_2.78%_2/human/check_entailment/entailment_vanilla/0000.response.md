### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves placing rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other. The player and the computer take turns placing rooks, and the computer mirrors the player's moves unless the move is along the diagonal. The goal is to calculate the number of possible final configurations after \(k\) moves, considering the mirroring rule and the constraints.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Each move by the player and the corresponding mirrored move by the computer reduces the number of available positions for future moves.
   - Moves along the diagonal (where \(r = c\)) reduce the effective number of moves by 1 because the computer cannot mirror such moves.
   - The number of remaining independent moves (not on the diagonal) is \(n - \text{num}\), where \(\text{num}\) is the count of diagonal moves.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The solution uses dynamic programming to count the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.
   - The base cases are handled correctly:
     - If there are no remaining moves (\(m = 0\)), the number of configurations is 0.
     - If there is exactly one remaining move (\(m = 1\)), the number of configurations is 1.
   - For more than one remaining move, the recurrence relation is used to calculate the number of configurations. The relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \mod (10^9 + 7)\) accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and considering the subsequent placements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where \(m = 0\) and \(m = 1\).
   - The dynamic programming approach is implemented correctly to handle larger values of \(m\).

5. **Input/Output Handling**:
   - The program reads the input correctly and processes each test case independently.
   - The output is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) as required.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem. The dynamic programming approach is appropriately applied, and the edge cases are handled correctly.

**Correctness: True**
