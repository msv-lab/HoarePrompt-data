Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed based on the input values provided within each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: Each iteration of the while loop processes a set of inputs (`n`, `k`, and subsequent pairs of integers `c` and `r`). Based on these inputs, it calculates a value `m` which is then used to compute and print a result using dynamic programming. The final output is a sequence of printed integers, each corresponding to the computed value of `dp[m]` for each input set processed by the loop. The exact values printed depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration.
