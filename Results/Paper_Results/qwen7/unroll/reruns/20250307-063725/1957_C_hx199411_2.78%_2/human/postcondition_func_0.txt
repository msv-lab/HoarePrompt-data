The function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and pairs of integers \( (r_i, c_i) \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( m \) based on the number of equal pairs \( (r_i, c_i) \) and prints a sequence of integers derived using dynamic programming. The final output consists of a series of integers, each corresponding to the computed value of \( dp[m] \) for each test case.
