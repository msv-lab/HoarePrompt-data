Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves. Each move is mirrored by the opponent unless the coordinates are identical, in which case the opponent skips their turn.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The number of unique positions available for rooks decreases as more rooks are placed.
   - The number of valid moves depends on the number of rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - The dynamic programming approach used in the code aims to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

3. **Dynamic Programming Explanation**:
   - The variable `num` counts the number of positions where the row and column indices are the same (`c == r`), indicating that the opponent cannot mirror the move.
   - The remaining positions `m = n - num` represent the number of unique positions left to place rooks.
   - The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of configurations for a given number of positions.
   - The base cases and recurrence relation in the DP array correctly handle the combinatorial nature of placing rooks in non-attacking positions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `m == 0`, there are no positions left, so the output is `0`.
   - When `m == 1`, there is exactly one position left, so the output is `1`.
   - For larger values of `m`, the recurrence relation correctly calculates the number of configurations using previously computed values.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits and handles large numbers correctly.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to compute the number of possible final configurations of rooks on the chessboard.

Correctness: **True**
