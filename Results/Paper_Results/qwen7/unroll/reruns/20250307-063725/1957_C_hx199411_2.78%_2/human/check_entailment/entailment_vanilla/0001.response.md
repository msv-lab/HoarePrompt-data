### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where you and the computer alternate placing rooks without attacking each other.
   - The computer mirrors your moves unless \( r = c \), in which case it skips its turn.
   - After the initial \( k \) moves, we need to calculate the remaining valid positions for rooks.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the \( k \) moves, counting the number of diagonal placements (where \( r = c \)) and non-diagonal placements.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of non-mirrored positions (diagonal and non-diagonal).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The number of remaining positions \( m \) is calculated as \( n - num \).
   - If \( m = 0 \), there are no more valid positions, so the result is 0.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is exactly one way to place a rook, so the result is 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the code uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for \( m \) positions.
   - Base cases are set for \( dp[1] \) and \( dp[2] \).
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \) is used to compute the number of configurations for \( i \) positions.
   - This recurrence accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and considering the two possible colors for the rook.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly by checking if \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \) directly.
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible configurations are counted correctly for larger values of \( m \).

### Conclusion:
The given code accurately implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the rules of the game.
