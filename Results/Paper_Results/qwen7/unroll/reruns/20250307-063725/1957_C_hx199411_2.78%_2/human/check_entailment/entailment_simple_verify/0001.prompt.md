You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers printed based on the input values provided within each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: Each iteration of the while loop processes a set of inputs (`n`, `k`, and subsequent pairs of integers `c` and `r`). Based on these inputs, it calculates a value `m` which is then used to compute and print a result using dynamic programming. The final output is a sequence of printed integers, each corresponding to the computed value of `dp[m]` for each input set processed by the loop. The exact values printed depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where you and the computer alternate placing rooks without attacking each other.
   - The computer mirrors your moves unless \( r = c \), in which case it skips its turn.
   - After the initial \( k \) moves, we need to calculate the remaining valid positions for rooks.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and the number of moves \( k \).
   - It then iterates through the \( k \) moves, counting the number of diagonal placements (where \( r = c \)) and non-diagonal placements.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of non-mirrored positions (diagonal and non-diagonal).

3. **Calculating Remaining Positions:**
   - The number of remaining positions \( m \) is calculated as \( n - num \).
   - If \( m = 0 \), there are no more valid positions, so the result is 0.
   - If \( m = 1 \), there is exactly one way to place a rook, so the result is 1.
   - For \( m > 1 \), the code uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of configurations.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation:**
   - The DP array `dp` is initialized to store the number of configurations for \( m \) positions.
   - Base cases are set for \( dp[1] \) and \( dp[2] \).
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) \% (10^9 + 7) \) is used to compute the number of configurations for \( i \) positions.
   - This recurrence accounts for placing a rook in one of the remaining positions and considering the two possible colors for the rook.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases correctly by checking if \( m = 0 \) or \( m = 1 \) directly.
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that all possible configurations are counted correctly for larger values of \( m \).

### Conclusion:
The given code accurately implements the logic to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after \( k \) moves, considering the constraints and the rules of the game.
