Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)`. This matches the problem statement.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program correctly identifies mirrored moves (where `c == r`) and counts them as `num`. For non-mirrored moves, it counts them as `2` (one for the player and one for the computer). This logic ensures that the program accounts for the mirroring behavior specified in the problem.

3. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: The program initializes a DP array `dp` to store intermediate results. It sets `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are base cases for the recurrence relation.

4. **Recurrence Relation**: The program uses a recurrence relation to fill the DP array:
   - `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-2] * 2) % (10^9 + 7)` for `i >= 3`.
   This relation correctly models the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells, considering the constraints of the problem.

5. **Output Calculation**: The program correctly computes the final number of configurations using the DP array and prints the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements accurately and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
