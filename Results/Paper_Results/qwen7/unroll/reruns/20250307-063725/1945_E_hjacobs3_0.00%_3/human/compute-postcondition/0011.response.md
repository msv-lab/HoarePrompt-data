Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer `find` such that `1 <= find <= n`. It performs a binary search to find the position where `find` would fit in the sorted version of `array`. If `find` is present in `array`, it returns a list containing the positions of `l + 1` and `array.index(find) + 1`. If `find` is not present, it returns a list containing the positions of `l + 1` and the position just before where `find` would be inserted. The function prints `1` if `find` is present and `0` if it is not.**
