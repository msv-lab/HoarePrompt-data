Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the element `x` is placed at the position `l` after performing at most 2 swaps. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  4 3
  4 3 1 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  1 3
  3 4
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program does not produce the correct output. Instead, it might output `0`, which means it does not perform any swaps, or it might output `1` and perform only one swap, which is insufficient to place `3` at the correct position.

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Initial State:**
   - Array: `[4, 3, 1, 5]`
   - `x = 3`
   - Initial `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `3` respectively.

2. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - First iteration:
     - `mid = (0 + 3) // 2 = 1`
     - Since `array[1] = 3` is equal to `x`, the function returns immediately without performing any swaps, setting `res` to `['0']`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints `0`, indicating no swaps were made, which is incorrect because `3` should be at index `1`.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to ensure that the element `x` is placed at the correct position using at most 2 swaps. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
