Output State: **The program returns a list containing two strings: "l + 1" and "array.index(find) + 1"**

Explanation: The code returns a list with two elements. The first element is the string representation of `l + 1`, where `l` is initially equal to `r + 1`. The second element is the string representation of `array.index(find) + 1`, which is the index of the `find` element in the list `array` (converted to a string and incremented by 1).
