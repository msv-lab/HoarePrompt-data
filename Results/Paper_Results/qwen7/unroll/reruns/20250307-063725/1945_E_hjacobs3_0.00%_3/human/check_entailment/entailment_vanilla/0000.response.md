Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds the target value `x` at position `l`.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by calling `func_1(array, x)` which performs a binary search and checks if the target value `x` is already at the correct position.
3. `func_1` function:
   - Initializes `l` and `r` to 0 and `n-1` respectively.
   - Performs a binary search to find the position where `x` should be.
   - Checks if the target value `x` is already at the correct position (`array.index(find)`). If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
4. The main loop reads test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
5. The issue with the provided code is that it only handles the case where exactly one swap is needed. It does not handle the case where two swaps are needed, as specified in the problem statement.
6. The problem states that "It can be shown that 2 operations are always sufficient," but the current implementation only handles the case where 1 operation is needed.
7. To correctly solve the problem, the code should handle both cases where 1 or 2 swaps are needed. This means checking for the presence of `x` and its correct position, and if not, finding the correct pair of indices to swap to place `x` in the correct position.

Given these points, the provided code is incomplete and does not fully address the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
