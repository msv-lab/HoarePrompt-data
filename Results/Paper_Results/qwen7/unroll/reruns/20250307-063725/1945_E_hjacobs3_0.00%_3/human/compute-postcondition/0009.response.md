Based on the initial state provided:

- `r` is the index of the last element in the list `array` that is less than `find`, or 0 if no such element exists.
- `l` is equal to `r` + 1.
- `l` is also equal to `array.index(find)`.

Given the print statement `print(0)`, the output will be explicitly printed as `0`.

Output: **0**
