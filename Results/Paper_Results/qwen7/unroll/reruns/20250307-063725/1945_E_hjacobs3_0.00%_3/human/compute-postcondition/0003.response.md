Output State: **The variable `l` will be equal to `r` + 1, and `r` will be the index of the last element in the list `array` that is less than `find`, or 0 if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The loop is performing a binary search on the list `array` to find the position where `find` would fit in the sorted order of `array`. After the loop finishes, `l` will be the first index where `array[l]` is greater than or equal to `find`, and `r` will be the last index where `array[r]` is less than `find`. If `find` is greater than all elements in `array`, `l` will be `n` and `r` will be `n-1`. If `find` is less than all elements in `array`, `l` will be 0 and `r` will be -1. In general, `l` will be `r` + 1, and `r` will be the largest index such that `array[r] < find`.
