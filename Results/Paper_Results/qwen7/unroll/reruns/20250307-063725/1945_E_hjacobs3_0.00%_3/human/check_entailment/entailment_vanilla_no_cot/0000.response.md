Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution as described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search implementation in `func_1` is incorrect. The function should return the indices to swap elements to ensure that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search. However, the current implementation only checks if `array[mid]` is greater than or equal to `find` and adjusts the `l` and `r` pointers accordingly. This does not guarantee that the final `l` will be the index where `x` should be placed.

2. **Swapping Elements**: The function `func_1` does not actually perform any swaps. Instead, it returns a list with indices which implies that it has found the indices to swap, but it does not execute these swaps within the function. To fix this, the function needs to identify the correct indices to swap and then perform those swaps.

3. **Multiple Swaps**: The problem states that the array can be rearranged using no more than 2 swaps to make `p_l` equal to `x`. The current implementation does not account for this requirement.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(len(res))
        for i, j in res:
            print(i, j)
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    index_x = array.index(find)

    # Find the correct position for x using binary search
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1

    # If x is already at the correct position, no swaps needed
    if l == index_x:
        return []

    # Determine the first swap
    if array[l] == find:
        # Swap the first occurrence of x with another element
        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] != find:
                array[i], array[l] = array[l], array[i]
                break
        return [(i + 1, l + 1)]

    # Determine the second swap if needed
    if l > 0 and array[l - 1] == find:
        array[l - 1], array[l] = array[l], array[l - 1]
        return [(l - 1 + 1, l + 1)]

    # Perform the first swap
    for i in range(n):
        if array[i] != find:
            array[i], array[l] = array[l], array[i]
            break
    # Perform the second swap
    for i in range(n):
        if array[i] != find:
            array[i], array[l - 1] = array[l - 1], array[i]
            break

    return [(i + 1, l + 1), (i + 1, l - 1 + 1)]
```

This corrected version ensures that the array is rearranged using no more than 2 swaps to place `x` at the correct position `l`.
