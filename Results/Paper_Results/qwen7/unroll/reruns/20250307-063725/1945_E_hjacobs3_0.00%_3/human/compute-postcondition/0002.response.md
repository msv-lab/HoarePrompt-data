Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l <= r`.
2. **Determine the current state of the loop variables**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is `n - 1`.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop `while l <= r` to execute at least once, the condition `l <= r` must be true.
   - Given that `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 <= n - 1` is always true for any positive integer `n`.

Since the condition `l <= r` is already satisfied with the given values (`l = 0` and `r = n - 1`), no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**Answer:**
State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n; `l` is 0; `r` is n - 1**
