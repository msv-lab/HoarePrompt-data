Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation with at most 2 swaps to make sure that after performing a binary search, the element at position `l` (which will be equal to `r` + 1) is equal to `x`.
2. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the required swaps. Specifically:
   - The binary search implementation is incorrect because it uses `l` and `r` incorrectly. The binary search should be used to find the position where `x` should be inserted to maintain the order.
   - The condition to check if a swap is needed is also incorrect. The current implementation checks if `l` is not equal to the index of `find`, which is not sufficient to ensure the correct order for binary search.
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the case where the element `x` is already in the correct position for the binary search to work.
3. The annotated program shows that the function `func_1` does not correctly identify the necessary swaps to achieve the desired order for the binary search.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
