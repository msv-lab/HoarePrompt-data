You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and find is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n.
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid] >= find:
            r = mid - 1
        else:
            l = mid + 1
        
    #State: The variable `l` will be equal to `r` + 1, and `r` will be the index of the last element in the list `array` that is less than `find`, or 0 if no such element exists.
    if (l != array.index(find)) :
        print(1)
        #This is printed: 1
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
        #The program returns a list containing two strings: "l + 1" and "array.index(find) + 1"
    else :
        print(0)
        #This is printed: 0
    #State: The variable `l` will be equal to `r` + 1, and `r` will be the index of the last element in the list `array` that is less than `find`, or 0 if no such element exists. Additionally, `l` is equal to `array.index(find)`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter array, which is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and a parameter find, which is an integer such that 1 <= find <= n. The function returns a list containing two strings: "l + 1" and "array.index(find) + 1".

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list containing two strings: "l + 1" and "array.index(find) + 1"


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
