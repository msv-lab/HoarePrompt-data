Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search can correctly identify the position of `x`.
2. The annotated program does not actually perform the necessary swaps to rearrange the array. Instead, it attempts to directly return the positions of the required swaps without making any changes to the array itself.
3. The logic inside the `func_1` function does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not perform any swaps and only checks whether `find` is present in the array.
4. The function should identify the correct positions to swap to ensure the binary search can find `x` correctly, but the current implementation does not do this.

Given these points, the program is not correct because it does not implement the required functionality of rearranging the array through at most 2 swaps to make the binary search work properly.

Correctness: **False**
