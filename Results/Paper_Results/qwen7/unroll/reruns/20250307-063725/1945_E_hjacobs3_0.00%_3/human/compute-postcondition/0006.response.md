Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` will be equal to `r` + 1.
- `r` will be the index of the last element in the list `array` that is less than `find`, or 0 if no such element exists.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the list `array`.

The `print(1)` statement simply prints the integer 1.

Output: **1**
