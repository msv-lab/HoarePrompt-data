Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer value of the input; no other variables are affected.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4], the value of `t` is updated to the integer value of the input provided by the user. No other variables (`n` or `x`) are affected by this operation.
