Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the cumulative subtraction of elements from the input list `T`, reversed and printed as space-separated strings.

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` each time. For each iteration, it reads an integer `n` and a line of space-separated integers `T`. It then constructs a list `a` where each element is derived by subtracting the corresponding element of `T` from the previous element of `a`. After processing all elements of `T`, it reverses the list `a` and prints it as a space-separated string. Since `t` can be any integer between 1 and \(10^4\), the final output will be the result of `t` such operations, each with its own `n` and `T`.
