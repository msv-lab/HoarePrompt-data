Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). It returns different outputs based on the values of `t`, `n`, and `x`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t`, `n`, and a list `x`. The function processes these inputs and produces an output for each test case according to the specified conditions.
