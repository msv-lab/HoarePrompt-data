Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates a list starting with 1000 and decreases by the corresponding values from the input list `x` in reverse order. Finally, it prints the resulting list as a space-separated string.**
