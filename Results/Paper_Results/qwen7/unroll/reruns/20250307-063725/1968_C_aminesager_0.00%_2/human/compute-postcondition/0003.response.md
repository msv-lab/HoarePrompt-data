Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers, each calculated based on the initial value of `t`, which ranges from 1 to 10^4. The list will start with 1000 and decrease by the corresponding values from the input list `T` in reverse order.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times, decrementing `t` by 1 each iteration. During each iteration, the user inputs an integer `n` and a space-separated list of integers `T`. The list `a` is initialized with 1000, and then for each subsequent element, it subtracts the corresponding value from `T`. After processing all elements, the list `a` is reversed, and its elements are printed as a space-separated string. Since `t` can vary from 1 to 10^4, the final output will be a list of 10^4 such sequences, each starting at 1000 and decreasing according to the input `T`.
