You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

    #State: The output state will be a list of integers, each calculated based on the initial value of `t`, which ranges from 1 to 10^4. The list will start with 1000 and decrease by the corresponding values from the input list `T` in reverse order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of `n-1` integers (1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). For each test case, it calculates a list starting with 1000 and decreases by the corresponding values from the input list `x` in reverse order. Finally, it prints the resulting list as a space-separated string.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `T`.

2. **Constructing the Array `a`:**
   - The array `a` is initialized with `[1000]`.
   - For each element in `T`, the program calculates `a[i]` as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
   - This calculation seems to be an attempt to satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - After constructing the array `a`, it reverses it using `a = a[::-1]`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - The reversed array `a` is printed as a space-separated string.

### Checking the Logic

1. **Initial Value of `a[0]`:**
   - The initial value of `a[0]` is set to `1000`. This is arbitrary but must be large enough to ensure that subsequent calculations do not produce negative values.

2. **Calculation of `a[i]`:**
   - The formula `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` is used to calculate the elements of `a`.
   - However, this formula does not necessarily guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). For example, if `T[i-1] > a[i-1]`, the result will be negative, which is invalid for modulo operations.

3. **Reversing the Array:**
   - Reversing the array does not affect the correctness of the solution since the problem only requires finding any valid array `a`.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

- For the first test case: `n = 4`, `T = [2, 4, 1]`
  - Initial `a = [1000]`
  - `a[1] = 1000 - 2 = 998`
  - `a[2] = 998 - 4 = 994`
  - `a[3] = 994 - 1 = 993`
  - Reversed `a = [993, 994, 998, 1000]`

This does not satisfy the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) because:
- \(2 \neq 993 \bmod 1000\)
- \(4 \neq 994 \bmod 993\)
- \(1 \neq 993 \bmod 994\)

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem because the formula `a[i] = a[i-1] - T[i-1]` does not guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
