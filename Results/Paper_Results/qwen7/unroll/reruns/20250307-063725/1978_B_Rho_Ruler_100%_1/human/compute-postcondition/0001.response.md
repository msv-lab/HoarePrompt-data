Output State: **`max_profit` is 0, `n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `max_profit` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables (`n`, `a`, `b`, `low`, and `high`). Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
