You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns with different pricing strategies.
   - For the first \( k \) buns, the price is \( b - i + 1 \).
   - For the remaining \( n - k \) buns, the price is \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1, plus the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at price \( a \).
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence and the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values using binary search.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates the lower bound; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.
   - The function returns the maximum profit found.

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, ensuring that the range is properly narrowed until the optimal \( k \) is found.
   - The use of `func_1` within the binary search loop ensures that the profit calculation is accurate for each candidate \( k \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \) correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found even when the profit does not change significantly around the optimal point.

Given the correctness of both functions and the proper implementation of binary search, the program accurately determines the maximum profit for each test case.
