Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotion rules. Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the profit for a given value of \( k \).
   - It uses the formula:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a
     \]
   - This formula accounts for the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function determines the optimal value of \( k \) using binary search.
   - It initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to the minimum of \( n \) and \( b \).
   - It iteratively narrows down the range to find the value of \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit for both \( mid \) and \( mid + 1 \) and updates the maximum profit accordingly.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the solution correctly identifies the optimal \( k \) and calculates the maximum possible profit. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
