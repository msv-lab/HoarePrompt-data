The function calculates and returns the total cost of selling `n` buns, where the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price `b`, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`. The modified price applies a discount that decreases the price of each subsequent bun by 1 unit compared to the previous one.
