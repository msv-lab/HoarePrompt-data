Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, `low` is 0, and `high` is the minimum of `n` and `b`.**

This means that the variables `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their initial values, while two new variables `low` and `high` are introduced and assigned specific values based on the initial conditions.
