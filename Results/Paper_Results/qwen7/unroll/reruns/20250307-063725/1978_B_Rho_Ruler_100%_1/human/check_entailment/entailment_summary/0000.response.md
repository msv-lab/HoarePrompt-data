Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling buns under the specified promotion.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the total profit for a given `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price). It correctly computes the profit using the formula \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).
3. The `func_2` function uses binary search to find the optimal value of `k` that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of `k` values from `0` to `min(n, b)` and uses `func_1` to compute the profit for each midpoint value. If the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`, it means increasing `k` could potentially yield a higher profit, so it adjusts the lower bound. Otherwise, it adjusts the upper bound. This process continues until the optimal `k` is found.
4. The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the binary search to find the maximum profit, considering all possible values of `k`.

Given the execution summaries and the logic implemented in both functions, they correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
