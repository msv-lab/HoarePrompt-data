Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. `n` is an integer representing the number of buns, `a` is an integer representing the usual price of a bun, and `b` is an integer representing the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. The function returns the maximum profit calculated by func_1 for any mid value within the range of low to high.**

This means the function `func_2` takes in the number of buns (`n`), the usual price of a bun (`a`), and the modified price of the first bun (`b`). It then calculates and returns the maximum profit using another function `func_1` for any midpoint value within a specified range (low to high).
