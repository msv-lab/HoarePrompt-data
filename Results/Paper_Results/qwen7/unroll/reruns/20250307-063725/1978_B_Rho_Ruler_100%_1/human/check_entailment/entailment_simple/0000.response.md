Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the maximum profit Bob can make by selling buns with a promotional price for the first `k` buns and a regular price for the remaining buns.

2. **Key Formulas**:
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at a modified price is given by \( k \times b - k \times \frac{(k - 1)}{2} \).
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a` is `(n - k) \times a`.

3. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The code uses binary search to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit.
   - `func_1` calculates the profit for a given `k`.
   - `func_2` uses binary search to find the best `k` within the range `[0, min(n, b)]`.

4. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search correctly updates the `low` and `high` bounds based on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`.
   - The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring all possible values of `k` are considered.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where `k` can be 0, meaning no buns are sold at the modified price.
   - The code also ensures that `k` does not exceed `min(n, b)`.

6. **Output**:
   - The function `func_2` returns the maximum profit found during the binary search.

Given the above analysis, the logic and implementation in the provided code seem correct and should produce the expected results based on the problem statement and examples.

Correctness: **True**
