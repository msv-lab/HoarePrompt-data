### Reasoning:

1. **Profit Calculation (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1(k, n, a, b)` correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \):
     - The first \( k \) buns are sold at prices \( b, b-1, b-2, \ldots, b-(k-1) \).
     - The sum of these prices is \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k-1)}{2} \).
     - The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
     - The total profit is thus \( k \times b - \frac{k \times (k-1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \).

2. **Binary Search (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2(n, a, b)` uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - The search range is from 0 to \( \min(n, b) \).
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), the profit is calculated using `func_1`.
   - The search adjusts the range based on whether the profit at \( mid + 1 \) is greater than the profit at \( mid \).

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic is sound. It correctly narrows down the optimal \( k \) by comparing the profits of consecutive midpoints.
   - The loop continues until the search range is exhausted, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as \( k = 0 \) and \( k = \min(n, b) \) correctly.
   - When \( k = 0 \), all buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).
   - When \( k = \min(n, b) \), the first \( k \) buns are sold at the highest possible modified prices, and the rest at the usual price \( a \).

5. **Efficiency**:
   - The binary search approach is efficient with a time complexity of \( O(\log(\min(n, b))) \), which is appropriate given the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum profit for selling the buns under the given conditions. The binary search approach ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found efficiently.
