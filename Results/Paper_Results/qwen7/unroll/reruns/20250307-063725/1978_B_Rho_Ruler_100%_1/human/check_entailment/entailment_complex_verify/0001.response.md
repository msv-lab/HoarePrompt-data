### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns with different pricing strategies.
   - For the first \( k \) buns, the price is \( b - i + 1 \).
   - For the remaining \( n - k \) buns, the price is \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1, plus the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at price \( a \).
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence and the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values using binary search.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates the lower bound; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.
   - The function returns the maximum profit found.

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, ensuring that the range is properly narrowed until the optimal \( k \) is found.
   - The use of `func_1` within the binary search loop ensures that the profit calculation is accurate for each candidate \( k \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \) correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found even when the profit does not change significantly around the optimal point.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The formula used in `func_1` is correct and matches the problem statement.
  - The function correctly calculates the profit for a given \( k \).

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The binary search implementation is correct and ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found.
  - The use of `func_1` within the binary search loop is appropriate and ensures accurate profit calculations.
  - Edge cases are handled correctly, as the binary search will properly narrow down the range to find the optimal \( k \).

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. Both functions are correctly implemented, and the binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found, leading to the maximum profit.
