Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all buns under the given promotional conditions.
- The `func_1` function correctly calculates the total cost of selling `n` buns with the first `k` buns sold at a modified price and the remaining `n-k` buns sold at the usual price `a`.
- The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the optimal `k` that maximizes the profit. It iteratively narrows down the range of `k` values from `0` to `min(n, b)` using the `func_1` function to calculate the profit for each midpoint `mid` and its successor `mid + 1`. This ensures that the maximum profit is found efficiently.
- The logic in `func_2` correctly updates the `max_profit` variable and adjusts the search range based on whether the profit for `mid + 1` is greater than the profit for `mid`.

Given the correct implementation of both functions and their logical correctness, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
