### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns with different pricing strategies.
   - For the first \( k \) buns, the price is \( b - i + 1 \).
   - For the remaining \( n - k \) buns, the price is \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1, plus the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at price \( a \).
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence and the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values using binary search.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates the lower bound; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.
   - The function returns the maximum profit found.

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, ensuring that the range is properly narrowed until the optimal \( k \) is found.
   - The use of `func_1` within the binary search loop ensures that the profit calculation is accurate for each candidate \( k \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \) correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found even when the profit does not change significantly around the optimal point.

Given the correctness of both functions and the proper implementation of binary search, the program accurately determines the maximum profit for each test case.
