The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` represents the number of buns, `a` represents the usual price of a bun, and `b` represents the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price. It calculates and returns the maximum profit possible by selling some of the buns at the modified price (`b`) and the rest at the usual price (`a`).
