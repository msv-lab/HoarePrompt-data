### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the profit from selling \( n \) buns with different pricing strategies.
   - For the first \( k \) buns, the price is \( b - i + 1 \).
   - For the remaining \( n - k \) buns, the price is \( a \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the profit for a given \( k \).
   - It computes the sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) and decreasing by 1, plus the profit from the remaining \( n - k \) buns at price \( a \).
   - The formula used is:
     \[
     \text{profit} = k \cdot b - \frac{k \cdot (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \cdot a
     \]
   - This formula correctly accounts for the sum of the first \( k \) terms of the arithmetic sequence and the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.
   - It iteratively narrows down the range of possible \( k \) values using binary search.
   - For each midpoint \( mid \), it calculates the profit using `func_1` and compares it with the profit for \( mid + 1 \).
   - If the profit for \( mid + 1 \) is greater, it updates the lower bound; otherwise, it updates the upper bound.
   - The function returns the maximum profit found.

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, ensuring that the range is properly narrowed until the optimal \( k \) is found.
   - The use of `func_1` within the binary search loop ensures that the profit calculation is accurate for each candidate \( k \).

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles edge cases where \( k = 0 \) or \( k = \min(n, b) \) correctly.
   - The binary search ensures that the optimal \( k \) is found even when the profit does not change significantly around the optimal point.

However, there is a critical flaw in the binary search implementation. The binary search should ensure that the profit is maximized, but the current implementation might miss the optimal \( k \) if the profit changes very slightly between two consecutive \( k \) values. Specifically, the condition `if profit_next > profit_mid:` might not always guarantee that the optimal \( k \) is found.

To illustrate, consider the following scenario:
- \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)
- The profit for \( k = 0 \) is \( 5 \cdot 5 = 25 \)
- The profit for \( k = 1 \) is \( 1 \cdot 9 - \frac{1 \cdot 0}{2} + (5 - 1) \cdot 5 = 9 + 20 = 29 \)
- The profit for \( k = 2 \) is \( 2 \cdot 8 - \frac{2 \cdot 1}{2} + (5 - 2) \cdot 5 = 16 - 1 + 15 = 30 \)
- The profit for \( k = 3 \) is \( 3 \cdot 7 - \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2} + (5 - 3) \cdot 5 = 21 - 3 + 10 = 28 \)
- The profit for \( k = 4 \) is \( 4 \cdot 6 - \frac{4 \cdot 3}{2} + (5 - 4) \cdot 5 = 24 - 6 + 5 = 23 \)
- The profit for \( k = 5 \) is \( 5 \cdot 5 - \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2} + (5 - 5) \cdot 5 = 25 - 10 + 0 = 15 \)

In this case, the optimal \( k \) is 2, but the binary search might not find it because the profit changes slightly between \( k = 2 \) and \( k = 3 \).

### Conclusion:
The binary search implementation in `func_2` might not always find the optimal \( k \) due to the slight changes in profit between consecutive \( k \) values. Therefore, the program is not guaranteed to find the maximum profit in all cases.
