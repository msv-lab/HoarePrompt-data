Output State: **The value of `max_profit` is the maximum profit calculated by `func_1` for any `mid` value within the range of `low` to `high`.**

Explanation: The loop is designed to find the maximum profit by iteratively narrowing down the range of possible `mid` values using binary search. The variable `max_profit` keeps track of the highest profit found during these iterations. After the loop completes, `max_profit` will hold the best possible profit that can be achieved according to the logic defined in `func_1`.
