Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a list of lists `u2vs` where each element `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of vertices connected to vertex `i`. The function does not return any value.**

This means the function `func_2` takes an integer `n` and a list of lists `u2vs` as inputs, where `n` represents the number of vertices in a tree, and `u2vs` provides the connections between vertices. However, the function itself does not produce any output; it simply processes the inputs without returning any value.
