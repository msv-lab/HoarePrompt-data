Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the sequence of nodes from node `b` back to node 0 following the BFS traversal, `n` remains as the input integer, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists, `d` remains the result of BFS starting from node 0, `previous` remains a list containing the previous node for each node in the BFS traversal, `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`, and `path_ba` is updated to include all nodes from `b` to 0.

In simpler terms, after the loop finishes, `path_ba` will contain the path from the last added node (which starts with `b`) back to the starting node (node 0) as determined by the BFS traversal. The other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
