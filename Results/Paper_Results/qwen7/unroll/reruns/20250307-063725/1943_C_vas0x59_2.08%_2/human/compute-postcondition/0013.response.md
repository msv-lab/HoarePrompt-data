Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, and all other variables (`b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`) remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The given code initializes an empty list `ops`. However, the loop described in the Initial State does not modify the list `ops`. Therefore, the list `path_ba` remains unchanged, still containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, and all other variables (`b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`) remain unchanged.
