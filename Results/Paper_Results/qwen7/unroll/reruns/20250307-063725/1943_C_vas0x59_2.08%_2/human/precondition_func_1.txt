n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of lists where u2vs[i] contains the indices of vertices connected to vertex i, and (u, v) are integers representing the indices of vertices connected by an edge such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
