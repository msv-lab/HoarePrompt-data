Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, and all other variables (`b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`) remain unchanged.

Explanation: The loop iteratively appends the previous node (`n`) of the current last node in `path_ba` until it reaches node `0` (where `previous[0] == -1`). The loop constructs the path from `b` back to `0` by following the `previous` list, but since the path is built by appending nodes, the final `path_ba` will be in reverse order. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
