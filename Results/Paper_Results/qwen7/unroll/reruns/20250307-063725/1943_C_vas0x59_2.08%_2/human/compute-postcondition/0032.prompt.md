You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of lists where u2vs[i] contains the indices of vertices connected to vertex i, and (u, v) are integers representing the indices of vertices connected by an edge such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n and u ≠ v.
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        u, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        u -= 1
        
        v -= 1
        
        u2vs[u].append(v)
        
        u2vs[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its connected nodes as elements based on user inputs. Each pair `(u, v)` from the input is added to both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]`, with indices adjusted by subtracting 1.
    d, _ = bfs(0)
    a = func_1(d)
    d, previous = bfs(a)
    b = func_1(d)
    path_ba = [b]
    while True:
        n = previous[path_ba[-1]]
        
        if n == -1:
            break
        
        path_ba.append(n)
        
    #State: Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, and all other variables (`b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`) remain unchanged.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iteratively appends the previous node (`n`) of the current last node in `path_ba` until it reaches node `0` (where `previous[0] == -1`). The loop constructs the path from `b` back to `0` by following the `previous` list, but since the path is built by appending nodes, the final `path_ba` will be in reverse order. All other variables remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop.
    ops = []
    if (len(path_ba) % 2 == 1) :
        ci = len(path_ba) // 2
        c = path_ba[ci]
        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba` rounded down, and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
    else :
        c2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        c1 = c2 - 1
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - c1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            
            ops.append((c2, i))
            
        #State: Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, `b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a` remain unchanged, `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of 2.
    #State: `path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, and all other variables (`b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`) remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba` rounded down, and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by `2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
    print(len(ops))
    #This is printed: len(path_ba) // 2 + 1 if len(path_ba) is odd, else len(path_ba) // 2
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    #This is printed: d 0\nd 1\nd 2
    return None
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of vertices in the tree, and a list of lists `u2vs` where each element `u2vs[i]` contains the indices of vertices connected to vertex `i`. The function does not return any value.

Return Postconditions: The program returns None


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
