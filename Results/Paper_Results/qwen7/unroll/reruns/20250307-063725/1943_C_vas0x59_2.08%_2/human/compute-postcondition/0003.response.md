Output State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its corresponding index's connected indices after processing all the input pairs `(u, v)`. Each pair `(u, v)` adds both `u` and `v` to each other's lists, making `u2vs` represent an undirected graph with `n` nodes.
