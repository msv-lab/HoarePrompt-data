Output State: **`b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its connected nodes as elements based on user inputs, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0, `previous` is a list containing the previous node for each node in the BFS traversal, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The line `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling `func_1` with `d` as the argument to the variable `b`. All other variables (`n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
