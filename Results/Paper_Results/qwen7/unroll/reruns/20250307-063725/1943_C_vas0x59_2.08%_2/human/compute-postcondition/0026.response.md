Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, `b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a` remain unchanged, `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `c1` is `c2 - 1`, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of 2.
