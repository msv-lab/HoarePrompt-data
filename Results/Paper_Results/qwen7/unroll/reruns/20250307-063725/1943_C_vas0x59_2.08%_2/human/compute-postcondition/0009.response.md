Output State: **`b` is added to the list `path_ba`, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its connected nodes as elements based on user inputs, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0, `previous` is a list containing the previous node for each node in the BFS traversal, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a new list `path_ba` and adds the value of `b` to it. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
