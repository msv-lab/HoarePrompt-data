Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists where each element is a list of integers representing the indices of vertices connected to the corresponding vertex.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged, as no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The value of `n` is updated to the integer input, and the structure of `u2vs` is preserved.
