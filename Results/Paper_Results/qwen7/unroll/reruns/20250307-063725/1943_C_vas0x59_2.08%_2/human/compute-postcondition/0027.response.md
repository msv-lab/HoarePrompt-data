Postcondition: **`path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, and all other variables (`b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, `a`) remain unchanged. If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba` rounded down, and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`. If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by `2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**
