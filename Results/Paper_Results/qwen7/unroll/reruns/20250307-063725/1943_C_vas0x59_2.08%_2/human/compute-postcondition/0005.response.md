Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its connected nodes as elements based on user inputs, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0, `_` is the second return value of BFS which is not used.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the BFS (Breadth-First Search) function starting from node 0. The BFS function returns two values: the distance from the starting node to all other nodes (`d`) and a second value which is not used (denoted by `_`). The distances are stored in the variable `d`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged.
