Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order, `b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a` remain unchanged, `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns `c1` the value of `c2 - 1`. Since `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2, `c1` is simply `c2 - 1`. The other variables (`path_ba`, `b`, `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `a`) remain unchanged.
