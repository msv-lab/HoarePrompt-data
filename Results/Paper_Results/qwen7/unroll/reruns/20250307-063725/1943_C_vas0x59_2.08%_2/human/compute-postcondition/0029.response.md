Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `path_ba` is a list containing the path from node `b` back to node `0` in reverse order.
   - `ops` is defined based on the length of `path_ba`:
     - If the length of `path_ba` is odd, `ops` contains tuples `(c, i)` for each `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, where `ci` is half the length of `path_ba` rounded down, and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
     - If the length of `path_ba` is even, `ops` contains tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from `1` to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1` with a step of `2`, where `c2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by `2`, and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

2. **Determine the Structure of `ops`:**
   - Since the exact `path_ba` is not provided, let's consider both cases:
     - **Odd Length Case:**
       - Suppose `path_ba` has an odd length, say `len(path_ba) = 7`.
       - `ci` would be `3` (half of 7 rounded down).
       - `ops` would contain tuples like `(path_ba[3], 0)`, `(path_ba[3], 1)`, `(path_ba[3], 2)`.
     - **Even Length Case:**
       - Suppose `path_ba` has an even length, say `len(path_ba) = 6`.
       - `c2` would be `3` (length of `path_ba` divided by 2).
       - `c1` would be `2` (`c2 - 1`).
       - `ops` would contain tuples like `(path_ba[1], 1)`, `(path_ba[2], 3)`.

3. **Printing the Tuples:**
   - The `print` statement uses `map` to apply a lambda function to each tuple in `ops`, converting it into a string format `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`.
   - Each tuple `(c, i)` is transformed into a string `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.

Given the above analysis, let's assume an example with an odd-length `path_ba` for clarity:

- Suppose `path_ba = ['b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']`.
- `ci` would be `3` (half of 7 rounded down).
- `ops` would be `[('d', 0), ('d', 1), ('d', 2)]`.

The `print` statement would output:
```
d 0
d 1
d 2
```

Output: **d 0\nd 1\nd 2**
