Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of `n` empty lists. Each inner list represents the indices of vertices connected to the corresponding vertex. Since no connections are added, all inner lists remain empty. The value of `n` and its nature (an input integer) are preserved.
