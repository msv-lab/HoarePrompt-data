Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially. The logic in the loop where `start_year` is updated is flawed. Specifically, the line `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` does not correctly compute the next year when the next sign will occur.

To fix this, we need to use the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities to determine the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        # Compute LCM of all periodicities
        result = reduce(lcm, nums)
        print(result)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the `lcm` function to compute the least common multiple of all periodicities, which gives the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
