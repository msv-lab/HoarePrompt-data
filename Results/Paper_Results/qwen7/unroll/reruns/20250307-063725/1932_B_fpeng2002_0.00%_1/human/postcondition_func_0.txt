The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a value `start_year` using a specific formula and prints this value. The function reads inputs from standard input and outputs the calculated values to standard output, resulting in a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the `start_year` value for each test case.
