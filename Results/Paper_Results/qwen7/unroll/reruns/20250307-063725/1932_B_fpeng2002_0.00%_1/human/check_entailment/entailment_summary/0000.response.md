Reasoning:
The provided program aims to calculate the year in which all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. The logic used in the program is to iteratively update the `start_year` based on the current year and the periodicity of the next sign. Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case:
   - It reads the number of signs \( n \).
   - It reads the periodicities \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0.
   - It iterates through the periodicities and updates `start_year` to the least common multiple (LCM) of the current `start_year` and the next periodicity \( a_{x+1} \), ensuring that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

The key part of the logic is the calculation of `start_year`:
```python
start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
```
This formula ensures that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is greater than the current `start_year`. This is equivalent to finding the LCM of the current `start_year` and `nums[x]`.

Given the problem statement and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
