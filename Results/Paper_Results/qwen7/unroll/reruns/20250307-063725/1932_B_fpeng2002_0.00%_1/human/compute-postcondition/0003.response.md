Output State: The output state will be a list of integers where each integer represents the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case specified by `num_tests`, the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from the input. It then iterates through the list, calculating `start_year` based on the formula provided. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of `start_year` for each test case. Therefore, the output will consist of one line per test case, with each line containing the computed `start_year` value for that specific test case.
