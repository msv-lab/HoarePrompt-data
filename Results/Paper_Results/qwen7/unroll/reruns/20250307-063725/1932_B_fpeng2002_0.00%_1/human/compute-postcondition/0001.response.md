Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `num_tests` is an input integer.
3. **Check the condition for the first iteration**: For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Given that `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it is greater than 0 for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the state right before the loop needs to be modified to ensure that `num_tests` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**
