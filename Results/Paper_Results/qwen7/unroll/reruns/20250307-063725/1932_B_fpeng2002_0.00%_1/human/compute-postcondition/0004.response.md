Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, an integer `n` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function processes these inputs but does not specify any particular output.**

This means the function `func` takes three parameters: `t`, which is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive; and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n`, each of which is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive. The function processes these inputs but does not specify what kind of output it returns.
