Output State: The output state will consist of `num_tests` lines, each containing an integer value for `start_year` calculated based on the input provided for each test case.

To break it down:
- For each test case, the value of `n` (number of elements in the list `nums`) and the list `nums` itself are taken as inputs.
- A variable `start_year` is initialized to 0.
- For each element in the list `nums`, the value of `start_year` is updated using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`.
- After processing all elements in the list `nums` for a given test case, the final value of `start_year` is printed.

The process is repeated `num_tests` times, with each iteration starting from the initial `start_year` value of 0 and updating it based on the input for that specific test case.
