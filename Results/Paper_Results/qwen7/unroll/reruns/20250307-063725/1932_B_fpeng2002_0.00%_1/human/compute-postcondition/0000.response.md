Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and the initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. This means `num_tests` now holds the number of test cases. However, the initial conditions for `t` (which is stated to be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` (where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and each a_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6) remain unchanged.
