Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually. This ensures that the solution is applied to each test case separately, as required.

2. **Reading Test Case Data**: For each test case, the program reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a_i`) correctly. The periodicities are stored in a list called `nums`.

3. **Calculating Start Year**: The program initializes `start_year` to 0. It then iterates through the list of periodicities, updating `start_year` using the formula:
   ```python
   start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
   ```
   This formula ensures that `start_year` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities seen so far plus one, adjusted to the next multiple of the current periodicity. This correctly simulates waiting for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one.

4. **Output**: The program prints the final value of `start_year` for each test case, which is the correct year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and handles the input and output as specified, the annotated explanation accurately reflects the intended behavior.

Correctness: **True**
