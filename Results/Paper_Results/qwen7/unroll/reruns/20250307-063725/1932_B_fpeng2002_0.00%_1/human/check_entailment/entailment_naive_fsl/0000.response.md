Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. According to the problem description, the tribe waits for the next sign to occur strictly after the previous one. However, the program calculates `start_year` as the least common multiple (LCM) of all the periodicities, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
- The LCM of 3, 2, 4, 5, 9, and 18 is 180.
- However, according to the problem description, the sequence of occurrences should be:
  - First sign in year 3.
  - Second sign in year 4 (after the first sign).
  - Third sign in year 8 (after the second sign).
  - Fourth sign in year 10 (after the third sign).
  - Fifth sign in year 18 (after the fourth sign).
  - Sixth sign in year 36 (after the fifth sign).

The program incorrectly calculates the year as 180 instead of 36. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
