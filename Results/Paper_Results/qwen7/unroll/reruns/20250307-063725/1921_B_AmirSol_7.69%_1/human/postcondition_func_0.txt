The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It counts the number of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering either a single differing position or two consecutive differing positions. The function returns this count as an integer.
