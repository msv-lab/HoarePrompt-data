You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes respectively.
def func_1(n, s1, s2):
    counter = 0
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            if i < n - 1 and s1[i + 1] != s2[i + 1] and s1[i] != s1[i + 1]:
                counter += 1
                i += 2
            else:
                counter += 1
                i += 1
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State: The counter variable will be incremented for each position where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, and there are two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position. The final value of `counter` will be the count of such occurrences.
    return counter
    #The program returns the count of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `s1`, a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'; and `s2`, another string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the count of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the count of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
