Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive); `s1`, a string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'; and `s2`, another string of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the count of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position.**
