#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5, s1 and s2 are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes respectively.

    #State: The counter variable will be incremented for each position where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, and there are two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position. The final value of `counter` will be the count of such occurrences.
    return counter
    #The program returns the count of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering two consecutive differing positions or a single differing position followed by a non-matching next position.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and two strings `s1` and `s2` of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'. It counts the number of positions where `s1[i]` is different from `s2[i]`, considering either a single differing position or two consecutive differing positions. The function returns this count as an integer.
