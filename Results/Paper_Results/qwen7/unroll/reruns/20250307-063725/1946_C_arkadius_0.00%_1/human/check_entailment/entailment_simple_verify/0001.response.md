### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search function `func_4` is correctly implemented. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n \) (the number of vertices in the tree).

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree when considering a specific \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if the current value of \( x \) is feasible by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

4. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The tree is constructed using the input edges.
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`), which is not shown but assumed to be correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where \( k = 0 \) by directly returning \( n \) (since no edges are removed, all vertices are in one component).
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient and finds the correct maximum \( x \).

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if a given \( x \) is feasible (`func_3`) and the binary search (`func_4`) are correctly implemented.
   - The input reading and tree construction are standard and do not introduce errors.

However, upon closer inspection of the helper functions and the logic, we notice the following issues:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the nodes in the tree. However, the logic for updating these attributes is not entirely clear and may not correctly reflect the desired properties.
  - Specifically, the `good_components` attribute is incremented only when a subtree has a remaining size greater than or equal to \( x \). This might not accurately represent the number of good components in the context of the problem.

- **Function `func_3`:**
  - The function `func_3` relies on the results of `func_1` to determine if a given \( x \) is feasible. If `func_1` does not correctly update the attributes, then `func_3` may also produce incorrect results.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` is a recursive helper function that calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree. However, the logic here is also not clearly explained and may not be consistent with the intended behavior.

Given these potential issues, especially in the helper functions, we cannot be certain that the overall logic is correct without further validation.

### Conclusion:
While the overall structure of the solution appears sound, the implementation details of the helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) are not clearly validated or explained. There is a risk that these functions may not correctly reflect the desired properties of the tree, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was overly optimistic about the correctness of the helper functions without sufficient validation. Further detailed testing and verification of the helper functions are necessary to ensure the overall correctness of the program.
