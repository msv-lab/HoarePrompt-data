Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, and `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with `n` nodes.**

Explanation: The code `tree = Tree(n)` creates an instance of the `Tree` class with `n` nodes. This does not change the values of `n` and `k`, but it assigns a new instance of the `Tree` class to the variable `tree`.
