You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search function `func_4` is correctly implemented. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n \) (the number of vertices in the tree).

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree when considering a specific \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if the current value of \( x \) is feasible by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

4. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The tree is constructed using the input edges.
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`), which is not shown but assumed to be correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where \( k = 0 \) by directly returning \( n \) (since no edges are removed, all vertices are in one component).
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient and finds the correct maximum \( x \).

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if a given \( x \) is feasible (`func_3`) and the binary search (`func_4`) are correctly implemented.
   - The input reading and tree construction are standard and do not introduce errors.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum \( x \) and helper functions to check the feasibility of each \( x \).

Correctness: **True**
