To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Tree Structure**: The program assumes a `Tree` class is defined, which is not shown in the snippet. However, the functions rely on methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and properties like `vertices`.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Component Size**: The main function `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that removing `k` edges results in components of size at least `x`.

3. **Helper Functions**:
   - `func_1`: This function seems to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - `func_2`: This function is a recursive helper for `func_1`.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if the current `x` value allows removing `k` edges such that no component is smaller than `x`.
   - `func_4`: This function performs the binary search using `func_3`.

### Analysis:

1. **Tree Traversal and Component Calculation**:
   - `func_1` and `func_2` seem to correctly traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size. They use a post-order traversal approach to ensure all children are processed before the parent.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - `func_4` correctly implements binary search to find the maximum `x`. It uses `func_3` to check if a given `x` is feasible.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the tree is split into multiple components after removing edges.
   - The binary search ensures that the largest possible `x` is found efficiently.

### Potential Issues:

- **Tree Class Implementation**: The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) are assumed to be implemented correctly. If these methods are incorrect, the entire solution could fail.
- **Input Handling**: The input handling in `func_5` is correct, assuming the `Tree` class is properly defined.

Given the provided functions and the logic, the program appears to be correct in terms of the provided problem description. The binary search and tree traversal logic are sound.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem, assuming the underlying `Tree` class and its methods are implemented correctly.
