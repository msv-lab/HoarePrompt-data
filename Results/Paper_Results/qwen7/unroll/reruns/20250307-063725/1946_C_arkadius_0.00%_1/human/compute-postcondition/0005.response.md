Output State: **The tree now has `n` nodes, with each node from 0 to `n-1`. Node 0 is connected to no parent (since the root parent is -1), and each subsequent node `u` from 1 to `n-1` is connected to node `u-1` as its parent.**

This output state describes the structure of the tree after the function call. Initially, the tree had `n` nodes, and the function `root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` was called to set up the tree. This function connects each node `u` (where `u` ranges from 1 to `n-1`) to its predecessor node `u-1`, making the tree a simple linear structure where each node points to the node before it, except for node 0, which has no parent.
