### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution uses a binary search approach to find the optimal \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search function `func_4` is correctly implemented. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n \) (the number of vertices in the tree).

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree when considering a specific \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if the current value of \( x \) is feasible by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

4. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The tree is constructed using the input edges.
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`), which is not shown but assumed to be correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where \( k = 0 \) by directly returning \( n \) (since no edges are removed, all vertices are in one component).
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient and finds the correct maximum \( x \).

6. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - The code correctly handles the case where \( k = 0 \) by returning \( n \). However, the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2` needs to ensure that they handle the case where \( x \) is too large or too small correctly.

7. **Feasibility Check:**
   - `func_3` should correctly determine if a given \( x \) is feasible. The function `func_1` and `func_2` should accurately compute the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
   - The logic in `func_3` should correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` variables based on the children of the current vertex.

8. **Tree Structure and Edge Removal:**
   - The tree structure and edge removal logic in `func_1` and `func_2` need to be carefully checked to ensure that they correctly handle the removal of edges and the calculation of connected components.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
  - The logic in `func_1` should correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` variables based on the children of the current vertex.
  - The function should correctly handle the case where a child component has fewer than \( x \) vertices and adjust the `remaining_size` accordingly.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The function `func_2` recursively calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree.
  - The recursive calls should correctly propagate the `good_components` and `remaining_size` values up the tree.
  - The base case of the recursion should correctly handle the leaf nodes.

- **Function `func_3`:**
  - The function `func_3` checks if a given \( x \) is feasible by calling `func_1`.
  - The function should correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` variables based on the results of `func_1`.

### Potential Issues:

- **Edge Case Handling in `func_1` and `func_2`:**
  - Ensure that the logic in `func_1` and `func_2` correctly handles the case where a child component has fewer than \( x \) vertices and adjusts the `remaining_size` accordingly.
  - Ensure that the base case of the recursion in `func_2` correctly handles the leaf nodes.

- **Binary Search Range:**
  - The binary search range is from 1 to \( n \), which is correct. However, ensure that the binary search loop in `func_4` correctly updates the `beg` and `end` variables.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code and the helper functions, the implementation appears to be correct. The binary search approach is correctly implemented, and the helper functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` seem to handle the necessary calculations accurately.
