The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), three integers n, k, and x where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and x represents the size threshold for the connected components. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good connected components (`good_components`) and their total remaining size (`remaining_size`). If the number of good connected components is greater than k, it returns True. If the number of good connected components equals k and the total remaining size is at least x, it also returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
