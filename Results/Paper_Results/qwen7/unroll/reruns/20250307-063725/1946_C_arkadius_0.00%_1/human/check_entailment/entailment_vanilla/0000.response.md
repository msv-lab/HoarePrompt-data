### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search function `func_4` is correctly implemented. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n \) (the number of vertices in the tree).

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree when considering a specific \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if the current value of \( x \) is feasible by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

4. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The tree is constructed using the input edges.
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`), which is not shown but assumed to be correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where \( k = 0 \) by directly returning \( n \) (since no edges are removed, all vertices are in one component).
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient and finds the correct maximum \( x \).

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if a given \( x \) is feasible (`func_3`) and the binary search (`func_4`) are correctly implemented.
   - The input reading and tree construction are standard and do not introduce errors.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum \( x \) and helper functions to check the feasibility of each \( x \).

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
