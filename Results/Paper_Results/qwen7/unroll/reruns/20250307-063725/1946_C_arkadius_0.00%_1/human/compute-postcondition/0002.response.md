Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head specifies the range `range(1, n)`, which means the loop variable `i` will take values from 1 to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, the initial value of `i` should be set to 1.

3. **Determine the Value of `n`**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`k` and `tree`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution directly. They remain unchanged.

Based on these points, we can conclude that the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state after adjustment should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
