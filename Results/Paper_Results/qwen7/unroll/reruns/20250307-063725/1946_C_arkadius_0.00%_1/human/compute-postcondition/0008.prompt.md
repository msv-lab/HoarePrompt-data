You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure where methods like add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive are defined.
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` nodes in the tree with edges added based on user inputs during the loop iterations. Each iteration adds one edge to the tree by connecting node `u-1` to node `v-1`.
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
    #This is printed: [value returned by func_4(tree, n, k)]
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It performs operations on a tree structure where methods like add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive are defined, ensuring that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The function returns nothing (None).

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
