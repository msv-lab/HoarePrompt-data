    #The program returns the number of good components and the remaining size for the vertex with index 's' in the tree.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. It processes the tree to update each node's `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes based on the given conditions. Specifically, it calculates the number of good components (subtrees with a remaining size greater than or equal to `x`) and the total remaining size of these components for the subtree rooted at vertex `s`. After processing, the function returns the number of good components and the remaining size for the vertex with index `s` in the tree.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `tree` is an instance of a tree class representing a tree with `n` vertices, `v` is an integer such that `1 <= v <= n` and represents a vertex in the tree, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing exactly `k` edges.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree class), a vertex `v`, and an integer `x`. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex `v`, calculating two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is incremented for each subtree where the remaining size is at least `x`, and `remaining_size` accumulates the sizes of subtrees where the remaining size is less than `x`. The function returns these two calculated values.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), three integers n, k, and x where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and x represents the size threshold for the connected components. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good connected components (`good_components`) and their total remaining size (`remaining_size`). If the number of good connected components is greater than k, it returns True. If the number of good connected components equals k and the total remaining size is at least x, it also returns True.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of nodes \( n \) and a value \( k \) from user input, constructs a tree structure with \( n \) nodes based on additional user-provided edges, roots the tree non-recursively starting from node 0, and then calls another function `func_4` with the tree, \( n \), and \( k \) as arguments. The final output is the result returned by `func_4`.
