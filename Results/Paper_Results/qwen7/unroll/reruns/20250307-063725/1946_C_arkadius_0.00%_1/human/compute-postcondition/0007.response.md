Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It performs operations on a tree structure where methods like add_edge and root_tree_non_recursive are defined, ensuring that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. The function returns nothing (None).**

This means the function `func_5` does not take any parameters but works with a pre-defined tree structure. It uses methods such as `add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive` to manipulate the tree under the given constraints (1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5). After performing the necessary operations, the function does not return any value, indicated by returning `None`.
