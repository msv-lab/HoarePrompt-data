The function `func_1` takes a `Tree` object `tree`, an integer `s` representing the starting vertex, and an integer `x` representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges. It processes the tree to update each node's `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes based on the given conditions. Specifically, it calculates the number of good components (subtrees with a remaining size greater than or equal to `x`) and the total remaining size of these components for the subtree rooted at vertex `s`. After processing, the function returns the number of good components and the remaining size for the vertex with index `s` in the tree.
