Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated input, and tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input, separated by a space, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The values of `n` and `k` are specific integers where 1 â‰¤ k < n â‰¤ 10^5. The `tree` variable remains unchanged and is still an instance of a class representing a tree structure.
