Functionality: **The function reads the number of nodes \( n \) and a value \( k \) from user input, constructs a tree structure with \( n \) nodes based on additional user-provided edges, roots the tree non-recursively starting from node 0, and then calls another function `func_4` with the tree, \( n \), and \( k \) as arguments. The final output is the result returned by `func_4`.**
