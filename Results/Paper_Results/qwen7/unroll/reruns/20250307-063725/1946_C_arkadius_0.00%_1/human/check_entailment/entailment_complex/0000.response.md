Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Purpose**:
   - `func_1`: This function updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each node in the tree. It uses a post-order traversal to calculate these values.
   - `func_2`: This function is a recursive helper function used by `func_1` to traverse the tree and calculate `good_components` and `remaining_size`.
   - `func_3`: This function checks if it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges such that each remaining connected component has a size of at least `x`. It uses `func_1` to get the initial values and then checks the conditions.
   - `func_4`: This function performs a binary search to find the smallest `mid` such that `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` returns `True`.
   - `func_5`: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to compute the result.

2. **Correctness of Individual Functions**:
   - `func_1` correctly updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes using a post-order traversal.
   - `func_2` is a correct implementation of the recursive part of `func_1`.
   - `func_3` correctly checks the conditions for the given `x` and returns the appropriate boolean value.
   - `func_4` performs a binary search correctly to find the smallest `mid` that satisfies the condition.
   - `func_5` correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to produce the final output.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly constructs the tree from the input.
   - It uses the binary search approach to efficiently find the maximum `x` that satisfies the condition.
   - The logic for checking the conditions and updating the tree attributes is sound.

Given that all the individual functions are correctly implemented and logically consistent with the problem statement, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
