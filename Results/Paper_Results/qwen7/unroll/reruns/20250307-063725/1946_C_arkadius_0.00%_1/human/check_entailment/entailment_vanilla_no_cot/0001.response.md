### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution uses binary search to find the maximum \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The binary search is performed between `beg = 1` and `end = n`.
   - For each midpoint `mid`, we use `func_3` to check if it's possible to have more than `k` good components (each having at least `mid` vertices).

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function seems to be incorrectly named as it doesn't perform a post-order traversal as implied by its name.
   - It should be `func_2` since it recursively checks the subtree sizes and updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size`.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly performs a recursive post-order traversal.
   - It calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at `v`.

5. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function uses `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size.
   - It checks if the number of good components is greater than `k` or if the remaining size is at least `x` when the number of good components equals `k`.

6. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function implements binary search using `func_3` to find the maximum \( x \).
   - It correctly narrows down the search space based on the results of `func_3`.

7. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to find and print the result.

### Analysis:
- The main issue lies in `func_1`. It is supposed to perform a post-order traversal but does not do so correctly. Instead, it seems to be trying to count good components and update remaining sizes in a non-standard manner.
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it does not correctly handle the post-order traversal and the counting of good components.

### Conclusion:
Given that `func_1` is incorrectly implemented and does not perform a proper post-order traversal, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Correctness: **False**
