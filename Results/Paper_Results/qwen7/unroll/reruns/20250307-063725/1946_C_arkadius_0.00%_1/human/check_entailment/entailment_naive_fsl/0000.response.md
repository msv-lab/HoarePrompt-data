Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for finding the maximum number \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least \( x \). 

The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Tree Structure**: The program uses a custom `Tree` class, but the implementation of the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not correctly traverse and process the tree structure to determine the sizes of the connected components after removing edges.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_4` function attempts to use binary search to find the maximum \( x \), but it relies on the `func_3` function which itself is not correctly implemented. Specifically, `func_3` does not correctly simulate the removal of edges and check the sizes of the resulting connected components.

3. **Missing Edge Removal Logic**: The program does not have a mechanism to actually remove edges from the tree and check the sizes of the resulting components. Instead, it seems to be attempting to determine the sizes of components without actually performing the edge removals.

Given these issues, the program cannot correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
