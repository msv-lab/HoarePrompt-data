Based on the initial state provided:

- The tree has `n` nodes, numbered from 0 to `n-1`.
- Node 0 does not have a parent (since the root parent is -1).
- Each subsequent node `u` from 1 to `n-1` is connected to node `u-1` as its parent.

The function `func_4` is not defined in the provided code snippet, so we need to infer its behavior based on the given information. Since there is no specific definition of `func_4`, let's assume it is a function that takes the tree structure, the number of nodes `n`, and an integer `k` as arguments, and returns a value based on the tree structure.

Given the structure of the tree, where each node `u` (for `u` from 1 to `n-1`) is the child of node `u-1`, the tree forms a linear structure with node 0 as the root and each node pointing to its immediate successor.

Without the exact definition of `func_4`, we can only describe the general context. If `func_4` were to return a value related to the tree structure, such as the parent of a certain node or a traversal result, we would need more information.

However, since the problem does not specify the exact behavior of `func_4`, and we are asked to determine the output based on the given information, we can reasonably assume that `func_4` might return a value directly related to the tree structure.

Given this, if `func_4` returns a value based on the tree structure, and considering the simplest case where `func_4` might return the parent of a certain node (which in this case would always be `u-1` for node `u`), the output could be described as follows:

Output: **[value returned by func_4(tree, n, k)]**
