### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify that each function works as intended and collectively they solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **TreeNode Class**: This class defines the structure of a tree node, including its edges, children, subtree size, parent, good components, and remaining size. These attributes are used to store information about the tree structure and the state during the computation.

2. **Tree Class**: This class manages the tree structure and provides methods to add edges and root the tree. The `root_tree_non_recursive` method ensures that the tree is properly rooted, which is crucial for the subsequent computations.

3. **func_1**: This function processes the tree to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for the subtree rooted at a given vertex `s`. It uses a post-order traversal to ensure that all child subtrees are processed before the current subtree.

4. **func_2**: This recursive function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for the subtree rooted at a given vertex `v`. It is essentially a helper function for `func_1`.

5. **func_3**: This function checks if the number of good components is greater than or equal to `k` and if the remaining size is at least `x`. It uses `func_1` to gather the necessary information.

6. **func_4**: This binary search function finds the smallest integer `x` such that `func_3` returns `True`. It effectively determines the maximum possible value of `x` that satisfies the problem constraints.

7. **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and then calls `func_4` to compute the desired result.

### Verification:

- **func_1** and **func_2** are correctly implemented to traverse the tree and calculate the required attributes.
- **func_3** correctly uses the results from `func_1` to check if the conditions are met.
- **func_4** uses binary search to efficiently find the maximum `x` that satisfies the conditions.
- **func_5** correctly reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls the necessary functions to produce the output.

Given that each function performs its intended task and the overall logic aligns with the problem statement, the program should work as expected.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct.

**Correctness: **True**
