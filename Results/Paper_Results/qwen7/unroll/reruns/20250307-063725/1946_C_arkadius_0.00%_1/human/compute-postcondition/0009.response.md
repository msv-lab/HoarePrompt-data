Postcondition: `tree` is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree with n vertices, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k < n, `x` is an integer representing the size threshold for the connected components, `good_components` is the result returned by `func_1(tree, 0, x)`, and `remaining_size` is the second value returned by `func_1(tree, 0, x)`. `good_components` is less than k or remaining_size is less than x.
