### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search function `func_4` is correctly implemented. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum \( x \).
   - The search range is from 1 to \( n \) (the number of vertices in the tree).

3. **Helper Functions:**
   - `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree when considering a specific \( x \).
   - `func_3` checks if the current value of \( x \) is feasible by calling `func_1`.
   - `func_5` reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

4. **Tree Construction and Rooting:**
   - The tree is constructed using the input edges.
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive method (`root_tree_non_recursive`), which is not shown but assumed to be correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where \( k = 0 \) by directly returning \( n \) (since no edges are removed, all vertices are in one component).
   - The binary search ensures that the solution is efficient and finds the correct maximum \( x \).

6. **Overall Logic:**
   - The logic for checking if a given \( x \) is feasible (`func_3`) and the binary search (`func_4`) are correctly implemented.
   - The input reading and tree construction are standard and do not introduce errors.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1` and `func_2`. These functions are designed to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes, but they do not correctly handle the scenario where multiple edges need to be removed to achieve the desired connected components.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - This function attempts to update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes.
  - However, it only considers the removal of edges from the subtree rooted at `s` and does not account for the possibility of removing edges that would split the tree into multiple components.
  - The function updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes based on the current subtree, but it does not ensure that the entire tree is considered for the removal of exactly `k` edges.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - This function is a recursive helper function that should be used to traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and remaining size for a given subtree.
  - Similar to `func_1`, it does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple edges need to be removed to achieve the desired connected components.

- **Function `func_3`:**
  - This function checks if a given `x` is feasible by calling `func_1`.
  - Since `func_1` does not correctly handle the removal of multiple edges, `func_3` may incorrectly determine whether a given `x` is feasible.

- **Function `func_4`:**
  - This function uses binary search to find the maximum `x` that is feasible.
  - Given that `func_3` may be incorrect due to the issues in `func_1` and `func_2`, the binary search may not find the correct maximum `x`.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment concluded that the program correctly implements the solution, but the analysis reveals that the helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not correctly handle the scenario where multiple edges need to be removed to achieve the desired connected components. Therefore, the program is likely to produce incorrect results.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
