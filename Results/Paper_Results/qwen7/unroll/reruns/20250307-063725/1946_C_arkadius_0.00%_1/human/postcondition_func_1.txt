The function accepts a tree (an instance of a tree class), a vertex `v`, and an integer `x`. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex `v`, calculating two values: `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `good_components` is incremented for each subtree where the remaining size is at least `x`, and `remaining_size` accumulates the sizes of subtrees where the remaining size is less than `x`. The function returns these two calculated values.
