tree is an instance of a Tree class representing a tree with n vertices, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and the method func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, mid: int) exists and returns a boolean indicating whether it's possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid.
