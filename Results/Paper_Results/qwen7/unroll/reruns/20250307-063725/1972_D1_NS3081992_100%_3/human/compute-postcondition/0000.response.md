Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the expression `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will iterate based on the return value of `func_10()`. The only variable directly involved here is the loop counter `_`, but since we cannot adjust the state of `_` (it will be automatically set by the loop), we focus on the function call `func_10()`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Since the loop is iterating based on the return value of `func_10()`, the function `func_10()` must return a positive integer for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), the only state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`. We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**State:**
**`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
