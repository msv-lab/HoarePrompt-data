### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given code and its functionality step-by-step:

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - The code defines several utility functions like `func_1` to `func_16`, but none of them directly solve the problem at hand. Specifically, `func_15` is the only function that appears to be relevant to the problem statement.

2. **Relevant Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         n, m = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
     - This function reads two integers `n` and `m` using `func_7()`.
     - It then iterates from `i = 1` to `i <= m` and checks if `i * i <= n + i`.
     - If the condition holds, it adds `(n + i) // (i * i)` to the answer `ans`.
     - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

3. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Function 15 Implementation**:
   - The current implementation of `func_15` does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the `while` loop does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Instead, it simply counts certain values based on the relationship between `n`, `m`, and `i`.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation does not perform this check and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the required functionality. The function `func_15` does not count the valid pairs according to the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
