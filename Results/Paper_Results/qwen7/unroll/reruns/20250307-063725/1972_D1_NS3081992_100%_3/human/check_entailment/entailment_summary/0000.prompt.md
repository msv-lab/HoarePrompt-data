Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function reads an integer from standard input (stdin) and returns it as an integer. This integer could represent various things depending on the context in which the function is used, such as the number of test cases or any other numerical input required for further processing.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads two integers from standard input, splits them, and converts them to integers, then returns these two integers.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from the standard buffer, splits it into two integers, and returns them as a list. The first element of the list is the value of \( n \) and the second element is the value of \( m \).
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` (0 ≤ `rows_number` ≤ 10^4) and returns a list. This list contains the result of calling another function `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the modified line.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes the trailing newline character, and decodes the remaining bytes into a string before returning it.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a string input from the standard input, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `rows` representing the number of test cases. It returns a list containing the result of calling another function `func_7()` exactly `rows` times.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function `func_9` reads the number of test cases `t` and then reads `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m` from the standard input stream. It returns a string containing this input data.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function reads an integer input from the user, representing the number of test cases (t), and returns this integer value.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads input from the standard input, splits it into two parts, and returns them as a list of strings. The list contains the values of `n` and `m`, which are separated by spaces.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` and updates a list `rank` based on the values in `d`. It returns either 1 or 11. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `d[da]`, marks elements in the `processing` list, recursively calls itself for each element, and updates the `tmp` variable with the minimum value obtained from these recursive calls. Finally, it sets the corresponding element in the `rank` list to `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, both constrained such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). If `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates values using the Euclidean algorithm and returns `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x` and `y` are intermediate results derived from the inputs. The final output represents a solution to a particular mathematical problem, likely related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and Bézout coefficients.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and adjusts `k` based on the difference between each element and `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function accepts no parameters and calculates the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all valid \(i\) from 1 up to the maximum value of \(i\) where both \(i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\) hold true, then returns this sum minus 1.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_15()` to compute some value based on \( n \) and \( m \), and writes the result to the standard output followed by a newline. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.
