Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_15` Logic**:
   - The function attempts to count pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), where \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation in `func_15` does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\). It instead tries to count pairs based on a different heuristic which does not match the problem requirements.

2. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and then check if \(a + b\) is divisible by \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        n, m = func_7()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_16()
```

This code iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
