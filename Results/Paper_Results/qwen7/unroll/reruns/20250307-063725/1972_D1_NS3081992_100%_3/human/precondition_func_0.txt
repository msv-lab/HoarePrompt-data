None of the variables in the function `func_1` are described in the function signature or within the function itself. The function reads an integer input from standard input (stdin) and returns it as an integer. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function should be part of a larger solution and might be reading the number of test cases (`t`) or other inputs required for the main logic.
