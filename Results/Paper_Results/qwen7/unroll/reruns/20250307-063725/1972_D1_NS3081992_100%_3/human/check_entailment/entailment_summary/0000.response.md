Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the function `func_16` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Reading Input**: The function `func_10` reads the number of test cases `t`. However, the actual reading of `n` and `m` for each test case is handled by `func_15`, which in turn calls `func_7` to read two integers from the input. This part is correct.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The function `func_15` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The logic within `func_15` seems to be designed to count the number of pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Output**: The function `func_16` correctly processes each test case by calling `func_15` and writing the result to the standard output. This matches the problem requirement to print the number of valid pairs for each test case.

Given the execution summaries and the code snippets, the function `func_15` appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The logic inside `func_15` iterates over possible values of \(i\) and counts the number of valid pairs based on the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Since `func_16` correctly handles the input/output and calls `func_15` appropriately, and `func_15` seems to correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs, the overall program should be correct.

Correctness: **True**
