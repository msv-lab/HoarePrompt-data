Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_15()` to compute some value based on \( n \) and \( m \), and writes the result to the standard output followed by a newline. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.**
