### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.), but these functions are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15` and `func_16`.
   - `func_15` is responsible for the actual calculation.
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

3. **Analysis of `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` takes two arguments, `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through values of `i` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
   - For each `i`, it calculates how many multiples of \(i^2\) fit within `n + i` and adds this count to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not directly solve the given problem. Instead, it counts the number of multiples of \(i^2\) up to \(n + i\). This approach does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair. The current implementation does not do this.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described.
