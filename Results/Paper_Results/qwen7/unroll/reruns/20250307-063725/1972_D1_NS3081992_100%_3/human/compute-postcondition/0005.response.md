Output State: **The program returns the sum of (n + i) divided by i^2 for all valid i from 1 up to the maximum value of i where both i <= m and i^2 <= n + i, minus 1.**

This means the program calculates the sum of \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) for all valid \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\)) and then subtracts 1 from this sum before returning the result.
