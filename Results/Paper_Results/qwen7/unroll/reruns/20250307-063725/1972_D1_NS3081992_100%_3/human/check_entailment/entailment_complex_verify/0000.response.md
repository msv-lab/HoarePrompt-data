### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The provided code includes several utility functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., but none of these functions directly address the core problem.
   - Functions like `func_15` and `func_16` do not perform the necessary calculations for the problem.
   - `func_15` calculates a sum involving \(n\) and \(m\), but it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - `func_16` simply calls `func_15` for each test case, which means it is not solving the problem correctly.

3. **Test Case Example**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - The pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\) need to be checked.
     - Valid pairs include \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\).
     - The provided code does not contain any function to check these conditions.

Given that the code does not contain any function that implements the required logic to solve the problem, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem as described.
