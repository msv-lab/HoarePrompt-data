Output State: **The value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all valid `i` from 1 up to the maximum value of `i` where both `i <= m` and \(i^2 <= n + i` hold true.**

To explain further, the loop iterates over values of `i` starting from 1 until either `i` exceeds `m` or `i^2` exceeds `n + i`. For each valid `i`, it adds the integer division of `(n + i)` by `i^2` to the variable `ans`. The final value of `ans` is the sum of these divisions for all such `i`.
