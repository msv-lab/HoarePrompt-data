Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions collectively solve the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions for each test case. Let's break down the functions and their roles:

1. **Reading Inputs:**
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from stdin.
   - `func_2()`: Reads two integers from stdin and returns them.
   - `func_3()`: Reads a line from stdin, splits it, and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_4(rows_number)`: Calls `func_3()` `rows_number` times and returns a list of results.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line from stdin and returns it.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a line from stdin, strips whitespace, and decodes it.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a string from stdin and returns a list of integers.
   - `func_8(rows)`: Calls `func_7()` `rows` times and returns a list of results.
   - `func_9()`: Reads the entire input from stdin and returns it.
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from stdin.
   - `func_11()`: Reads a line from stdin and returns a list of strings.

2. **Processing Inputs:**
   - `func_12()`: This function is not directly relevant to solving the problem but appears to deal with graph traversal and ranking.
   - `func_13()`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD and BÃ©zout coefficients. This is useful for checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - `func_14()`: Adjusts `k` based on the difference between elements in `a` and `m`. This function is also not directly relevant to solving the problem.
   - `func_15()`: Calculates the sum of \(\frac{n + i}{i^2}\) for all valid \(i\) and returns it minus 1. This function is designed to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the problem constraints.
   - `func_16()`: Processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and writing the result to stdout.

Given the problem requirements, the most relevant functions are `func_15()` and `func_16()`. `func_15()` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case, and `func_16()` processes multiple test cases by calling `func_15()` appropriately.

Since `func_15()` correctly counts the number of valid pairs and `func_16()` correctly processes each test case, the overall program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
