You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_12` processes a dictionary `d` and updates a list `rank` based on the values in `d`. It returns either 1 or 11. If the length of `d[da]` is 1, the function immediately returns 1. Otherwise, it iterates through the list `d[da]`, marks elements in the `processing` list, recursively calls itself for each element, and updates the `tmp` variable with the minimum value obtained from these recursive calls. Finally, it sets the corresponding element in the `rank` list to `tmp + 1` and returns `tmp + 1`.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\).

    #State: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \neq 0\)
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, g
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`, both constrained such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). If `b` is zero, the function returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calculates values using the Euclidean algorithm and returns `(y, x - a // b * y, g)`, where `x` and `y` are intermediate results derived from the inputs. The final output represents a solution to a particular mathematical problem, likely related to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and Bézout coefficients.

    #State: a is a list of integers where each element is at least m, and k is the original value minus the total difference between each element in a less than m and m. Additionally, k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and adjusts `k` based on the difference between each element and `m`. If `k` is non-negative after the adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and n + m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.

        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The value of `ans` is the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all valid `i` from 1 up to the maximum value of `i` where both `i <= m` and \(i^2 <= n + i` hold true.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of (n + i) divided by i^2 for all valid i from 1 up to the maximum value of i where both i <= m and i^2 <= n + i, minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and calculates the sum of \((n + i)\) divided by \(i^2\) for all valid \(i\) from 1 up to the maximum value of \(i\) where both \(i \leq m\) and \(i^2 \leq n + i\) hold true, then returns this sum minus 1.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: t test cases are executed, and for each test case, the value returned by func_15() is written to the standard output followed by a newline.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \), where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 \). For each test case, it calls another function `func_15()` to compute some value based on \( n \) and \( m \), and writes the result to the standard output followed by a newline. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given code does not contain any function that calculates this value. Instead, it includes various utility functions that do not seem to be related to solving the problem.

To verify this, let's consider a simple test case:

- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - The pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\) need to be checked.
  - We need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

For example, for the pair \((2, 2)\):
- \(a + b = 2 + 2 = 4\)
- \(\gcd(2, 2) = 2\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)
- Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), the pair \((2, 2)\) is valid.

However, the provided code does not contain any function that performs these checks. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
