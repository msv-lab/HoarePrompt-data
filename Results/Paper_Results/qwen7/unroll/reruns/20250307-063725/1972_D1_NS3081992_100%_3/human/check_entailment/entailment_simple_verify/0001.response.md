### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.), but these functions are not used in the main logic.
   - The main logic is implemented in `func_15` and `func_16`.
   - `func_15` is responsible for the actual calculation.
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case.

3. **Analysis of `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` takes two arguments, `n` and `m`.
   - It initializes `i` to 1 and `ans` to 0.
   - It iterates through values of `i` from 1 to \(\sqrt{n + i}\).
   - For each `i`, it calculates how many multiples of \(i^2\) fit within `n + i` and adds this count to `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_15` does not directly solve the given problem. Instead, it counts the number of multiples of \(i^2\) up to \(n + i\). This approach does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair. The current implementation does not do this.

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Let's consider the example given in the problem statement:
     - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the valid pairs are:
       - \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(2\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\).
       - \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(3\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\).
       - \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 2\).
       - \((3, 1)\): \(3 + 1 = 4\) and \(4\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(3, 1) = 1\).
       - \((4, 1)\): \(4 + 1 = 5\) and \(5\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(4, 1) = 1\).
       - \((5, 1)\): \(5 + 1 = 6\) and \(6\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(5, 1) = 1\).
       - \((6, 1)\): \(6 + 1 = 7\) and \(7\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(6, 1) = 1\).
       - \((6, 2)\): \(6 + 2 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(6, 2) = 2\).
       - \((6, 3)\): \(6 + 3 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(3 \cdot \gcd(6, 3) = 3\).
       - \((7, 1)\): \(7 + 1 = 8\) and \(8\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(7, 1) = 1\).
       - \((8, 1)\): \(8 + 1 = 9\) and \(9\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(8, 1) = 1\).
       - \((9, 1)\): \(9 + 1 = 10\) and \(10\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(9, 1) = 1\).
       - \((10, 1)\): \(10 + 1 = 11\) and \(11\) is a multiple of \(1 \cdot \gcd(10, 1) = 1\).
       - \((10, 2)\): \(10 + 2 = 12\) and \(12\) is a multiple of \(2 \cdot \gcd(10, 2) = 2\).
     - The total number of valid pairs is 14, which matches the expected output.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem as described. The current implementation does not iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition for each pair.
