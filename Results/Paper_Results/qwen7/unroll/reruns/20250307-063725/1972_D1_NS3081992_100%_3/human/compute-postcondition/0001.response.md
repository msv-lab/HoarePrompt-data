Output State: **t test cases are executed, and for each test case, the value returned by func_15() is written to the standard output followed by a newline.**

Explanation: The loop runs `func_10()` times, and for each iteration, it writes the result of `func_15()` to the standard output followed by a newline. The number of test cases `t` is determined by the return value of `func_10()`, and for each test case, the output is the value returned by `func_15()`.
