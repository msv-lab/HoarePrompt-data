Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the given code does not contain any function that calculates this value. Instead, it includes various utility functions that do not seem to be related to solving the problem.

To verify this, let's consider a simple test case:

- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - The pairs \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\) need to be checked.
  - We need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

For example, for the pair \((2, 2)\):
- \(a + b = 2 + 2 = 4\)
- \(\gcd(2, 2) = 2\)
- \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b) = 2 \cdot 2 = 4\)
- Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), the pair \((2, 2)\) is valid.

However, the provided code does not contain any function that performs these checks. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
