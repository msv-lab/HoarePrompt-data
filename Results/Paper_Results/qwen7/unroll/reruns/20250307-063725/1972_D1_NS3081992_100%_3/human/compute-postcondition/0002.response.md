Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `m` such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `n` and `m`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `m`. It processes these values according to specified constraints and returns some form of output (though the exact nature of the return value isn't detailed here) based on the relationship between `n` and `m` within each test case.
