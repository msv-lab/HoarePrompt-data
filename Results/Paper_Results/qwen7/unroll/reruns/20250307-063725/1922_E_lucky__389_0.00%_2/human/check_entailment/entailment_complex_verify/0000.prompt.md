You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, X is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^{18}.

    x = int(input())

    #State: mx is the maximum value of i found during the loop, subseq_lens is a list containing all the values of i that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
    ansv = [i for i in range(mx)]
    for i in range(1, len(subseq_lens)):
        ansv.append(subseq_lens[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop; `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the conditions within the loop; `ansv` is a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, with each integer appended once from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end.
    print(len(ansv))
    #This is printed: mx + len(subseq_lens)
    for i in range(len(ansv)):
        print(ansv[i], end=' ')
        
    #State: The output state remains unchanged as no variables `mx`, `subseq_lens`, or `ansv` are modified within the loop. The loop simply prints the elements of `ansv` one by one.
    print()
    #This is printed: each element of the list `ansv` in sequence
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a single test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\). It calculates a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during a specific loop. Additionally, it appends elements from another list `subseq_lens` to this list. Finally, it prints the length of the resulting list followed by its elements in sequence.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle the case when `X` is a prime number. For a prime number `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because the number of increasing subsequences is closely related to the factorization of `X`. Specifically, if `X` is a prime number, there is no way to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences with any array.

To illustrate this, consider the case when `X = 37`. Since 37 is a prime number, the program should output `-1` indicating that it is impossible to construct such an array. However, the program does not check if `X` is prime and always tries to construct an array, which leads to incorrect results for prime values of `X`.

Here is an example input that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
37
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```

Since the program does not handle the case when `X` is a prime number correctly, the correctness is **False**.
