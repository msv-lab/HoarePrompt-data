Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\). The function does not return any specific value but seems to perform some operations based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case defined by `t` and `X`, but since no specific return value is mentioned, it implies that the function's primary action is to handle or compute something related to these inputs without explicitly returning a value.
