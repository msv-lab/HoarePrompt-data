Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The program attempts to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences using powers of 2. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic used to determine the lengths of the subsequence is flawed and does not always produce the correct result.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the array followed by the array elements. However, the logic to generate the array is incorrect, leading to invalid outputs.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is small or large, and it does not account for all possible values of `X`.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming to ensure that the constructed array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The current implementation does not achieve this.
