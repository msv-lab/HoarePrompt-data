### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to confirm this.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find an array of integers of length at most 200 such that it has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.
   - If it's impossible, we should return -1.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program attempts to construct an array based on the binary representation of \(X-1\).
   - It iteratively finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to \(X+1\) and appends the corresponding index to `subseq_lens`.
   - Finally, it constructs the array `ansv` using these lengths.

3. **Key Issues**:
   - The program does not check if \(X\) is a prime number.
   - For prime numbers, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider \(X = 37\), which is a prime number.
   - The program will try to construct an array, but since 37 is prime, it cannot be achieved.
   - The expected output is `-1`, but the program outputs an array instead.

5. **Detailed Steps**:
   - For \(X = 37\):
     - \(X - 1 = 36\).
     - Binary representation of 36: `100100`.
     - The program will append indices based on the binary representation.
     - This results in an array like \([-1, -1, 0, 0, 2, 3, -1]\), which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct. The program fails to handle the case where \(X\) is a prime number, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
