Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The solution provided attempts to construct such an array using a specific algorithm involving binary representation and powers of 2.

2. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes each test case.
   - It starts by decrementing `x` by 1.
   - It then iterates to find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `x + 1` and constructs a list `subseq_lens` which contains the exponents of these powers of 2 minus 1.
   - After constructing `subseq_lens`, it creates the final array `ansv` by initially filling it with integers from 0 to `mx-1` and then appending elements from `subseq_lens`.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The approach of using powers of 2 to construct the number of increasing subsequences is sound. Each unique integer in the array contributes to the count of increasing subsequences in a predictable manner.
   - The construction of `subseq_lens` ensures that the total number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.
   - The final array `ansv` is constructed correctly according to the problem requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `X = 2`, the array `[0]` is correctly generated since it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]`.
   - For larger `X`, the algorithm correctly constructs the array by leveraging the properties of binary numbers and powers of 2.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the length of the array followed by the elements of the array, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
