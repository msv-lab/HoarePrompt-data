Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle the case when `X` is a prime number. For a prime number `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because the number of increasing subsequences is closely related to the factorization of `X`. Specifically, if `X` is a prime number, there is no way to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences with any array.

To illustrate this, consider the case when `X = 37`. Since 37 is a prime number, the program should output `-1` indicating that it is impossible to construct such an array. However, the program does not check if `X` is prime and always tries to construct an array, which leads to incorrect results for prime values of `X`.

Here is an example input that demonstrates the issue:

**Input:**
```
1
37
```

**Expected Output:**
```
-1
```

**Actual Output:**
```
7
-1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1
```

Since the program does not handle the case when `X` is a prime number correctly, the correctness is **False**.
