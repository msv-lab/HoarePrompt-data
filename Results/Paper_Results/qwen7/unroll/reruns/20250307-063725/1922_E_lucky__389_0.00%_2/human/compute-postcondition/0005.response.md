Output State: **mx is the maximum value of i found during the loop, subseq_lens is a list containing all the values of i that satisfy the conditions within the loop.**

Explanation: The loop iterates as long as `x` is not zero. In each iteration, it calculates the highest power of 2 (represented by `2 ** (i + 1)`) that is less than or equal to `x + 1`, and then checks if this power corresponds to a valid step. If `i` is greater than 0, it means a valid step was found, and `i` is added to `subseq_lens`. Then, `x` is decreased by `2 ** i - 1`, and `mx` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `i`. This process continues until `x` becomes 0. Therefore, `mx` will hold the largest `i` found during the loop, and `subseq_lens` will contain all such `i` values that were valid during the iterations.
