Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a mathematical approach to construct such an array.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The number of increasing subsequences of a sequence can be determined by its structure. Specifically, the number of increasing subsequences of a sequence can be related to the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences formed by the unique elements in the sequence.
   - The code attempts to construct such a sequence by breaking down the target number of increasing subsequences (`X`) into powers of 2, which helps in determining the lengths of the required subsequences.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly calculates the necessary lengths of the increasing subsequences using powers of 2.
   - It constructs the array by ensuring that the number of increasing subsequences matches the target (`X`).
   - The logic for constructing the array seems to be correct, as it ensures that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 2 by returning `[0]`.
   - For other values of `X`, the code correctly constructs the array by appending the necessary elements to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences.

5. **Output**:
   - The code outputs the length of the constructed array followed by the array elements, which is consistent with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly solve the problem for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
