Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `x` is now an integer input from the user.
