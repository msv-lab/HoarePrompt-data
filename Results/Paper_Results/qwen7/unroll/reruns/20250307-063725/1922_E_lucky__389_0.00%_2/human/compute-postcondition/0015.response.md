Functionality: **The function processes a single test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\). It calculates a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, where `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during a specific loop. Additionally, it appends elements from another list `subseq_lens` to this list. Finally, it prints the length of the resulting list followed by its elements in sequence.**
