Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i` that satisfy the conditions within the loop.
- `ansv` is a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, with each integer appended once from `subseq_lens` starting from index 1 to the end.

To determine what will be printed, we need to focus on the length of the list `ansv`.

Since `ansv` is constructed by appending each integer from `subseq_lens` to the range of integers from 0 to `mx-1`, the length of `ansv` will be the sum of the number of elements in the range 0 to `mx-1` and the number of elements in `subseq_lens`.

The range 0 to `mx-1` contains `mx` elements. Therefore, the length of `ansv` is `mx + len(subseq_lens)`.

However, since the exact values of `mx` and `subseq_lens` are not provided, we can only express the length of `ansv` in terms of these variables.

Output: **mx + len(subseq_lens)**
