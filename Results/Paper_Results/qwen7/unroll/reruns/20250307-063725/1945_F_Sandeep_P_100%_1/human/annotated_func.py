#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.
def func_1(fillvalue):
    """Decorator to make a repr function return fillvalue for a recursive call."""
    return decorating_function
    #The program returns the decorating_function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `fillvalue` and returns a `decorating_function`. This function is designed to modify the behavior of another function by providing a specific value (`fillvalue`) when a recursive call is made to its `repr` method.
