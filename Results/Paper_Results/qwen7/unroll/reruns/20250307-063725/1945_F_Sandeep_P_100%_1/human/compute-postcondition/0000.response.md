Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, v is a list of n integers where each integer v_i satisfies 1 <= v_i <= 10^9, and p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.**

The provided code is a docstring for a decorator function and does not actually modify any variables or perform any operations that would change the initial state. Therefore, the values of `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.
