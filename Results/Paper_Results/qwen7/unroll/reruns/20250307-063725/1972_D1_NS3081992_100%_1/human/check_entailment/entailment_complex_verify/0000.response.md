### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Observations:
1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - **Function 15 (`func_15`)**: This function attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic.
   - **Function 16 (`func_16`)**: This function is supposed to handle multiple test cases and call `func_15` for each test case. However, `func_15` does not correctly solve the problem.

3. **Function 15 (`func_15`)**:
   - **Logic**: The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to the maximum value of \(i\) where \(i \leq m\) and \(i * i \leq n + i\), and then subtracts 1 from this sum.
   - **Issue**: This logic does not address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating some other unrelated value.

4. **Function 16 (`func_16`)**:
   - **Logic**: This function calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result.
   - **Issue**: Since `func_15` does not correctly implement the required logic, the output will be incorrect.

5. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotation for `func_15` states that it calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to the maximum value of \(i\) where \(i \leq m\) and \(i * i \leq n + i\), and then subtracts 1 from this sum. This does not match the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given these observations, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem. The function `func_15` does not address the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), and therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
