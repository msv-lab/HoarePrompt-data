Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the list `a` and adjusts the value of `k` based on whether each element is less than `m`. If `k` is non-negative after adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.**
