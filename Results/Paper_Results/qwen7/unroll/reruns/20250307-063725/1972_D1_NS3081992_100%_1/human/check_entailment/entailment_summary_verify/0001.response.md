### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes several utility functions for reading input, but the core logic for solving the problem is encapsulated in `func_15`.
   - `func_15` attempts to count the number of valid pairs by iterating through possible values of \(i\) and adding to the answer based on a formula. However, the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not correctly implement the problem's constraints.

3. **Verification of `func_15`**:
   - Let's analyze the formula in `func_15`:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         (n, m) = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - The formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\) does not check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). It simply counts the number of multiples of \(i^2\) up to \(n + i\), which is not equivalent to the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation in `func_15` does not perform this check and thus will not yield the correct results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, the solution is indeed incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
