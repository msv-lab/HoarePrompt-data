Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any implementation that addresses this specific condition.

For example, consider the test case \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):

- The valid pairs should be \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 1)\).
- The output for this test case should be `3`.

However, the provided code does not contain any logic to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
