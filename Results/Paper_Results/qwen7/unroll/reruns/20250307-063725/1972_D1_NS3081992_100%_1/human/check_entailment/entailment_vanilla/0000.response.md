### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement. Instead, it includes various utility functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., which are used for reading input but do not perform the required calculation.
   - The only function that seems relevant is `func_15`, which calculates the number of valid pairs using a specific formula. However, this formula might not be correct for the given problem since it does not involve checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

3. **Verification of `func_15`**:
   - `func_15` attempts to count the number of valid pairs by iterating through possible values of \(i\) and adding to the answer based on a formula. This approach does not seem to correctly implement the problem's constraints.
   - Specifically, the formula `(n + i) // (i * i)` does not account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, the solution is incorrect.
