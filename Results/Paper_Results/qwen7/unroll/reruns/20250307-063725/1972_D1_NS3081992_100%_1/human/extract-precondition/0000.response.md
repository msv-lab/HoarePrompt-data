Precondition: **func_10 returns an integer representing the number of test cases (t), and for each test case, two integers n and m are provided such that 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6 and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^6.** 

Additionally, for each test case:
- **n and m are positive integers.**
- **func_15 calculates and returns the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions: 1 \leq a \leq n, 1 \leq b \leq m, and a + b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a, b).**
