The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers with `b` being non-zero. Depending on the value of `b`, it either returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` as a non-negative integer, or it recursively computes and returns values `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results of calling itself with `b` and `a % b`.
