### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several utility functions for reading input, but the primary function `func_15` is responsible for solving the problem.
   - `func_15` attempts to count the number of valid pairs by iterating through possible values of \(i\) and adding to the answer based on a formula. However, the formula used in `func_15` does not correctly implement the problem's constraints.

3. **Verification of `func_15`**:
   - Let's analyze the logic in `func_15`:
     ```python
     def func_15():
         n, m = func_7()
         i = 1
         ans = 0
         while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
             ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
             i += 1
         return ans - 1
     ```
   - The loop iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and checks if \(i^2 \leq n + i\). If true, it adds \((n + i) // (i^2)\) to the answer.
   - This formula does not account for the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it uses a heuristic that does not guarantee correctness.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The provided `func_15` does not implement this logic and instead uses a heuristic that does not satisfy the problem's constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that `func_15` does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, the solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, and the function `func_15` does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
