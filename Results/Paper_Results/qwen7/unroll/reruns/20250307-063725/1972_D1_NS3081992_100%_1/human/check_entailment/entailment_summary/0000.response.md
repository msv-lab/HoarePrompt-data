Reasoning:
- The main function `func_16` reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then processes each test case by calling `func_15()`.
- `func_15` takes two integers `n` and `m` as input and calculates the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
- To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that `func_15` correctly implements the logic to count the valid pairs for each test case.

Let's analyze `func_15`:
- It reads `n` and `m` using `func_7()`, which reads a space-separated list of integers from standard input.
- It initializes `ans` to 0 and iterates from `i = 1` up to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i` and `i <= m`.
- For each `i`, it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to `ans`.

This logic seems to be an attempt to count valid pairs, but let's check if it matches the problem statement:
- The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The given implementation in `func_15` does not directly address the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) = 0\).

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, `func_15` does not seem to correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the function `func_15` is likely incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
