Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to solve a specific problem related to counting ordered pairs (a, b) under certain conditions.
2. The core logic of the solution is encapsulated in the `func_15` function, which calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m.
3. The main function `func_16` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_15` and printing the result.
4. All other functions (`func_1` to `func_14`) are either helper functions or do not contribute to solving the main problem. They are not used in the execution of `func_15` or `func_16`.
5. The provided example and the annotated program match the problem description and the expected behavior of the solution.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correctly structured and functional for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
