Functionality: **The function processes a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating the processing status, an integer `da` representing the current node, and a list `rank` representing the rank of each node. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it updates `tmp` to the minimum value of `tmp` and the result of recursive calls to `func_12` for each unprocessed node connected to `da`, and finally returns `tmp + 1`.**
