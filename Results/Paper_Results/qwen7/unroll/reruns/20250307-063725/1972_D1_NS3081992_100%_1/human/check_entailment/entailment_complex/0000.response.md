Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The core logic of the solution is encapsulated in `func_15()`, which handles the calculation for a single pair \((n, m)\).
- `func_16()` correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and printing the result.
- All other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input, and they do not affect the correctness of the solution as long as they correctly read the input.
- Given that `func_15()` is designed to solve the problem for a single pair \((n, m)\) and `func_16()` correctly iterates over all test cases and prints the results, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
