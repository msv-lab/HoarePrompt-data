Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns an integer representing the number of test cases (t). For each test case, two integers n and m are provided such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2·10^6 and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^6.**

This means the function `func_16` does not take any input parameters but instead generates or retrieves the number of test cases (t) that follow specific constraints. Each test case involves two integers, n and m, both within the range of 1 to 2·10^6, and the total sum of these integers across all test cases does not exceed 2·10^6.
