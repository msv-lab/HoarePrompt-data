Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: The functions defined (1 through 16) do not match the requirements of the problem. Specifically, the function `func_15` and `func_16` do not correctly implement the logic needed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Logic Error in `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` attempts to count valid pairs but uses a different approach that doesn't align with the problem statement. It calculates something related to the number of multiples but does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop and the calculation of `ans` do not correctly reflect the required conditions.

3. **Missing Core Logic**:
   - The core logic needed to solve the problem involves iterating over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This is missing from the provided code.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) within the given constraints.
- For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
- Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Count the number of such pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from math import gcd

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def main():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the problem statement.
