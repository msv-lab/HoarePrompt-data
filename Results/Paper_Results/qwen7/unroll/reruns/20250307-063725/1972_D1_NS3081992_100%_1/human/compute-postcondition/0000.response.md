Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. Here, the loop variable `_` is used, but it doesn't matter since it's just a placeholder. The important part is the function call `func_10()` which returns the number of iterations for the loop.

2. **Understand the Function `func_10()`**: The function `func_10()` returns an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases. This means the loop will run `t` times.

3. **Determine the State Adjustments**: Since the loop will run `t` times, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since `range(t)` requires `t` to be a non-negative integer). Additionally, the loop body processes `n` and `m` for each test case, but these variables are not mentioned in the loop head, so they don't need to be adjusted here.

4. **State Before the Loop Starts**: The state before the loop starts includes the result of `func_10()`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`, ensuring it returns a positive integer.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
