Output State: **The program returns the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all integers i from 1 to the maximum value of i where i <= m and i * i <= n + i, minus 1.**

To break this down:
- We start with the initial state where `ans` is defined as the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all integers `i` from 1 up to the largest integer `i` such that `i * i <= n + i`.
- The code snippet `return ans - 1` simply subtracts 1 from the value of `ans`.
- Therefore, the final output is the calculated `ans` value minus 1.
