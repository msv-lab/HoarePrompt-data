### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
We need to calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
- The code includes several utility functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., but none of these functions directly address the core logic required to solve the problem.
- The main function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and then calls `func_15` for each test case.
- `func_15` is supposed to handle the logic for calculating the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\).

#### Function `func_15` Analysis:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:
1. It initializes \((n, m)\) using `func_7()`, which reads space-separated integers from input.
2. It iterates through values of \(i\) from 1 up to \(m\) and checks if \(i^2 \le n + i\).
3. For each valid \(i\), it adds \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\) to `ans`.
4. Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

This approach does not account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be counting something else, likely related to the distribution of squares within a certain range.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we would need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). This involves:
1. Reading \(n\) and \(m\).
2. Iterating through all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
3. Checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Counting the number of valid pairs.

Given that `func_15` does not implement this logic, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem.
