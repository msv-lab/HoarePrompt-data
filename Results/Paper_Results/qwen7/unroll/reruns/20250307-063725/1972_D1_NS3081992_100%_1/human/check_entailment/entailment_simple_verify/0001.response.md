### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes several utility functions for reading input, but the core functionality is encapsulated in `func_15`.
   - `func_15` attempts to count the number of valid pairs using a specific formula. Let's analyze this function in detail.

3. **Verification of `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` iterates through possible values of \(i\) from 1 to the maximum value where \(i \le m\) and \(i^2 \le n + i\).
   - For each \(i\), it adds \((n + i) // (i * i)\) to the answer. This part of the logic is somewhat related to the problem but does not fully capture the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

4. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - The condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\) needs to be checked for every pair \((a, b)\). The current implementation in `func_15` does not check this condition.
   - The formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\) is derived from a different problem and does not directly address the given condition.

5. **Correct Implementation**:
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The current implementation in `func_15` does not perform this check, leading to incorrect results.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem, the solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate because the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. The function `func_15` does not check the necessary condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\), making the solution incorrect.
