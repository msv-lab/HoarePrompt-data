Output State: **mx is the maximum value between its original value (0) and the sum of cur plus k times a[s], considering all iterations; cur is the cumulative sum of a[s] from the start until the last iteration where k becomes 0 or vis[s] becomes 1; k is 0; s is the final node index where the loop exits.**

This means:
- `mx` will hold the highest value it reached during any iteration of the loop, which is the maximum of its original value (0) and the expression `cur + k * a[s]`.
- `cur` will be the total sum of `a[s]` added up from the start until the last iteration where `k` becomes 0 or `vis[s]` becomes 1.
- `k` will be 0 after the loop ends.
- `s` will be the final node index that caused the loop to exit, i.e., either `vis[s]` became 1 or `k` became 0.
