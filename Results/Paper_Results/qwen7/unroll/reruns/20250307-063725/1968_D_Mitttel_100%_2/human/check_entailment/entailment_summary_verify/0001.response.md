### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It parses the input for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It also correctly parses the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The line `for i in range(n): p[i] -= 1; a[i] -= 1` adjusts the indices of the permutation and the array to be zero-based, which is necessary since Python uses zero-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions).
   - It iterates while the current position has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current position's value to the current score (`cur`), decrements the remaining turns (`k`), and updates the current position (`s`).
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints the appropriate result based on the comparison:
     - "Draw" if the scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the player might stay at the same position multiple times without moving to another position.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the player might not move at all during the game.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a potential issue with the function `func_1`. The function assumes that the player will always move to the next position in the permutation until the end of the game, even if it means staying in the same position repeatedly. This assumption might not always yield the optimal strategy for maximizing the score, especially when the permutation and the array values are such that staying in the same position could potentially yield a higher score than moving.

To verify this, consider the following scenario:
- Suppose `p = [1, 2, 3]` and `a = [10, 1, 1]`.
- If a player starts at position 0, they would get 10 points initially and then stay at position 0 because moving to position 1 would only add 1 point, which is less than staying at position 0.

In this case, the function `func_1` might not correctly handle scenarios where staying in the same position could yield a higher score. The function should consider the possibility of staying in the same position to maximize the score.

### Conclusion:
While the overall structure of the program seems correct, the function `func_1` might not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly those involving the optimal strategy for maximizing the score. Therefore, the original assessment might be slightly inaccurate due to this potential oversight.
