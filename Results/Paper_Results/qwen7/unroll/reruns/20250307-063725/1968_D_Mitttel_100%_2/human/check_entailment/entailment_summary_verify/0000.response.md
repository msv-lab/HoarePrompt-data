### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` in detail to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The game involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, taking turns based on a permutation and an array of scores.
- Each player starts at a given position and can either stay or move to the position indicated by the permutation.
- The goal is to determine the winner after `k` turns.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the maximum score a player can achieve starting from a given position `s` for `k` turns. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Length of the permutation `p`.
   - `mx`: Maximum score achievable.
   - `cur`: Current cumulative score.
   - `vis`: Visited positions to avoid infinite loops.

2. **Loop**:
   - Iterate as long as `k > 0` and the current position `s` has not been visited.
   - Mark the current position `s` as visited.
   - Update `mx` with the maximum of its current value and the sum of `cur` and `k * a[s]`.
   - Add `a[s]` to `cur` to update the cumulative score.
   - Decrement `k` by 1.
   - Move to the next position `p[s]`.

3. **Return**:
   - Return the maximum value between `mx` and `cur`.

#### Correctness of `func_1`
The function `func_1` correctly simulates the game logic by ensuring that a player can stay at the same position if they choose to do so. The loop ensures that the player follows the permutation until `k` turns are completed, and the maximum score is updated accordingly.

#### Main Program Analysis
The main program reads the input, processes the permutation and scores, and calls `func_1` for both players' starting positions. Based on the returned scores, it determines the winner.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, read `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - Read the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Processing**:
   - Adjust indices in `p` and `a` to be zero-based.
   - Call `func_1` for both players' starting positions.
   - Compare the scores and print the result.

#### Example Verification
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  - Bodya starts at position 3, and Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5\) (since \(a_3 = 5\)).
    - Bodya's new position: \(3\) (stays at the same position).
    - Sasha's score: \(2\) (since \(a_2 = 2\)).
    - Sasha's new position: \(1\) (moves to \(p_2 = 1\)).
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5\) (no change since Bodya stays at position 3).
    - Sasha's score: \(2 + 7 = 9\) (since \(a_1 = 7\)).

- **Actual Output**:
  - The program correctly calculates the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha by considering all possible moves and staying at the same position if beneficial.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" and handles all scenarios accurately.

### Final Evaluation
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game," and the function `func_1` properly accounts for all possible moves and staying at the same position if beneficial.
