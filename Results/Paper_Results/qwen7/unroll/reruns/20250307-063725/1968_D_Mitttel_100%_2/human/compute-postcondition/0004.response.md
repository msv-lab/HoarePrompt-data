Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while not vis[s] and k > 0:`. The variables involved are `vis[s]` and `k`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The condition `not vis[s]` means that the loop will execute as long as `vis[s]` is `False`.
   - The condition `k > 0` means that the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `mx` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `cur` is 0 (this variable is not part of the loop head).
   - `vis` is a list of `n` elements, each element being 0. This means `vis[s]` is `False` because all elements in `vis` are 0.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `vis[s]` is already `False` (because all elements in `vis` are 0), no adjustment is needed for `vis[s]`.
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. Currently, the state does not specify the value of `k`, but it must be greater than 0 for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `k` to ensure it is greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`mx` is 0, `cur` is 0, `k` must be greater than 0**
