### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to simulate the game for each test case and determine the winner based on the scores of Bodya and Sasha after `k` turns.
   - Each player starts at a specified position and alternates between staying at their current position or moving to the position indicated by the permutation `p`.
   - The score is incremented by the value of `a` at the current position.

2. **Analyze the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
   - It then calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha to compute their respective maximum possible scores.
   - The function `func_1` simulates the game for one player, updating the score and position according to the rules until `k` turns are completed or the player has visited all positions.

3. **Check Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` for `k` turns.
   - It uses a while loop to iterate through the turns, updating the score (`cur`) and checking if the player should stay or move based on the permutation `p`.
   - The variable `mx` keeps track of the maximum score achieved during the simulation.

4. **Verify the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that the player's score is updated correctly and the maximum score is tracked accurately.
   - The function handles the case where the player might revisit positions multiple times within the `k` turns.

5. **Overall Program Flow:**
   - The main part of the program correctly calls `func_1` for both players and compares their scores to determine the winner.
   - The conditions for drawing, Bodya winning, and Sasha winning are handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the provided problem description and constraints. There are no apparent errors in the implementation.

### Correctness:
**True**
