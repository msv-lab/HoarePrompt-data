### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It parses the input for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It also correctly parses the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The line `for i in range(n): p[i] -= 1; a[i] -= 1` adjusts the indices of the permutation and the array to be zero-based, which is necessary since Python uses zero-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions).
   - It iterates while the current position has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current position's value to the current score (`cur`), decrements the remaining turns (`k`), and updates the current position (`s`).
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints the appropriate result based on the comparison:
     - "Draw" if the scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the player might stay at the same position multiple times without moving to another position.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the player might not move at all during the game.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.
