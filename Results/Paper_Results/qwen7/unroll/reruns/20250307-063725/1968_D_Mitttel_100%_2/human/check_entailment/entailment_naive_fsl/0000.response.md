Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game." Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly account for the possibility of a player moving back to their original position after a series of moves. This can lead to incorrect scores, especially in scenarios where the permutation allows for such moves.

Consider the following example:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- Expected Output:
  - Bodya starts at position 3, and Sasha starts at position 2.
  - After the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5\) (since \(a_3 = 5\)).
    - Bodya's new position: \(3\) (stays at the same position).
    - Sasha's score: \(2\) (since \(a_2 = 2\)).
    - Sasha's new position: \(1\) (moves to \(p_2 = 1\)).
  - After the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: \(5\) (no change since Bodya stays at position 3).
    - Sasha's score: \(2 + 7 = 9\) (since \(a_1 = 7\)).

- Actual Output:
  - The program incorrectly calculates the maximum score for Bodya and Sasha without considering the full sequence of moves and staying at the same position if possible.

Given this, the program fails to handle the scenario where a player can stay at the same position after a series of moves, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
