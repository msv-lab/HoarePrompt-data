### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of `func_1` Function

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n = len(p)` sets the length of the permutation.
   - `mx = 0` initializes the maximum score.
   - `cur = 0` initializes the current score.
   - `vis = [0 for _ in range(n)]` initializes a list to keep track of visited positions.

2. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop runs as long as the current position `s` has not been visited (`not vis[s]`) and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - `vis[s] = 1` marks the current position as visited.
   - `mx = max(mx, cur + k * a[s])` updates the maximum score considering the current position's contribution.
   - `cur += a[s]` adds the score from the current position to the cumulative score.
   - `k -= 1` decreases the remaining turns.
   - `s = p[s]` moves to the next position in the permutation.

3. **Return Statement**:
   - The function returns `mx`, which is the maximum score achievable starting from the given position `s`.

#### Correctness of the Program

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps`.
   - It also correctly converts the permutation and array into zero-indexed lists.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha, passing the appropriate parameters.
   - It then compares the results and prints the correct output.

3. **Handling of Moves**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly handles the movement according to the permutation and updates the score accordingly.
   - The function ensures that the player does not revisit a position more than once by marking it as visited.

4. **Final Comparison**:
   - The program correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.

#### Validation Using Annotated Code

The annotated code confirms that the function correctly simulates the game for a single player, considering the constraints of the permutation and the remaining turns. The function updates the score and keeps track of visited positions to avoid revisiting the same position multiple times.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic for the "Permutation game" as described in the problem statement. The original assessment incorrectly identified a flaw that does not exist in the provided code.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct and accurately implements the logic for the "Permutation game."
