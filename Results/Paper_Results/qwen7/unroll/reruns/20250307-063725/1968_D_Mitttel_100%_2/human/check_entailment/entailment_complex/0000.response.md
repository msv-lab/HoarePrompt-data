Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, Bodya and Sasha, moving through a permutation array `p` for `k` turns. Each player starts at a specific position and gains points based on the values at their current positions. They can choose to stay at their current position or move to the position indicated by the permutation.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s`.
   - It uses a loop to simulate the game for `k` turns, updating the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`) based on the player's moves.
   - The loop continues as long as `k` is greater than 0 and the position `s` has not been visited before.
   - The function correctly handles the logic of staying at the current position or moving to the next position based on the permutation.

3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes each test case by calling `func_1` for both players' starting positions.
   - It compares the scores obtained from `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.
   - The logic for determining the winner is correct: if the scores are equal, it prints "Draw"; if Bodya's score is higher, it prints "Bodya"; otherwise, it prints "Sasha".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where the starting positions are the same and the game duration is zero (both players get 0 points).
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the game duration is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by using the loop to simulate the game steps.

5. **Code Correctness**:
   - The code accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum score for a given starting position.
   - The main program correctly uses the function results to determine the winner.

Given the analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
