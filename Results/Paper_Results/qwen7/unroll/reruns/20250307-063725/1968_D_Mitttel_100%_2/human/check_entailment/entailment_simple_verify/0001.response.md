### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It parses the input for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It also correctly parses the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
   - The line `for i in range(n): p[i] -= 1; a[i] -= 1` adjusts the indices of the permutation and the array to be zero-based, which is necessary since Python uses zero-based indexing.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score for a player starting at position `s` over `k` turns.
   - It initializes variables `mx` (maximum score), `cur` (current score), and `vis` (visited positions).
   - It iterates while the current position has not been visited and there are still turns left (`k > 0`).
   - Inside the loop, it updates the maximum score (`mx`), adds the current position's value to the current score (`cur`), decrements the remaining turns (`k`), and updates the current position (`s`).
   - The function returns the maximum score calculated.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic correctly calls `func_1` for both Bodya and Sasha.
   - It compares the scores returned by `func_1` for Bodya and Sasha.
   - It prints the appropriate result based on the comparison:
     - "Draw" if the scores are equal.
     - "Bodya" if Bodya's score is greater.
     - "Sasha" if Sasha's score is greater.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the player might stay at the same position multiple times without moving to another position.
   - The program correctly handles the case where the player might not move at all during the game.

Upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the function `func_1`, there is a potential issue with the way the `vis` list is initialized. The annotation states that `vis` is initialized as `[0 for _ in range(n)]`, but the code actually initializes it as `[0] * n`. This means that `vis` is a list of `n` zeros instead of a list of `n` lists, which could lead to incorrect behavior if the function were to modify the inner list.

However, the function `func_1` does not modify the `vis` list itself; it only sets individual elements to 1 when a position is visited. Therefore, the initialization of `vis` as a list of `n` zeros should not cause any issues in this specific context.

Given that the rest of the logic seems correct and the function `func_1` behaves as expected, the original assessment is accurate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is correct.
