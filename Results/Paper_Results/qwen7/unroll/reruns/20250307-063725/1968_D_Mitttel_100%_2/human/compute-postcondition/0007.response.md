Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a list of integers `a`, a permutation of integers from 1 to n `p`, a list of integers `s` representing starting positions, and a positive integer `k` representing the duration of the game. It returns the maximum value between its original value (0) and the sum of `cur` plus `k` times `a[s]` after considering all iterations.**
