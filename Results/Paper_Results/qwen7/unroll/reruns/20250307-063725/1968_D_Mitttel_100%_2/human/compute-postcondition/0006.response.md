Output State: **The program returns mx, which is the maximum value between its original value (0) and the sum of cur plus k times a[s], considering all iterations.**

In this scenario, since `k` is 0, the term `k * a[s]` will always be 0. Therefore, `mx` will essentially be the maximum value of `cur` across all iterations. Since `s` is the final node index where the loop exits, `cur` represents the cumulative sum of `a[s]` from the start until the last iteration where `vis[s]` becomes 1 or `k` becomes 0. Given that `k` is already 0, the only consideration for `mx` is the value of `cur` at the end of the loop. Hence, `mx` is the maximum value of `cur` obtained during the iterations.
