Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. The `func_1` function simulates the game for a given starting position and calculates the final score.
3. The logic within `func_1` is sound:
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the current score (`cur`) and the maximum score (`mx`).
   - It uses a `vis` list to avoid revisiting positions, ensuring that each position is only considered once per turn.
   - It iterates while `k` is positive and the current position has not been visited.
   - During each iteration, it updates the current score and the maximum score, then moves to the next position according to the permutation.
4. The main part of the program correctly compares the scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result based on the comparison.
5. The only potential issue could be in the handling of large values of `k` and the number of iterations, but the provided code handles these by decrementing `k` in each iteration and stopping when `k` becomes zero or a position is revisited.

Given that the logic in both the main part and the helper function `func_1` aligns with the problem statement and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
