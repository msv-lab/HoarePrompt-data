Functionality: **The function processes a series of inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s`. It prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on specific conditions related to the value of `n` and the content of `s`. If `n` is 2, it checks if `s` equals '00'. Otherwise, it counts the number of '1's in `s` and checks if the count is even and if there are no two consecutive '1's. The function does not return any value; it only prints the results of its checks.**
