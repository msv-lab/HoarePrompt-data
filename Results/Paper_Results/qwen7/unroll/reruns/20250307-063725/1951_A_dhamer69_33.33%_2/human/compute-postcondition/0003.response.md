Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration where `t` is greater than 0.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. Inside the loop, the program reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. Based on the value of `n`, it checks specific conditions and prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. If `n` is 2, it checks if `s` is '00'; if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. If the count of '1's is odd or there is exactly one occurrence of '11', it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.
