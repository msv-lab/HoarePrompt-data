Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration where `n` and `s` are provided as inputs.

For each iteration of the loop:
- If `n` equals 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, if `n` is not 2, it checks if the number of '1's in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11'. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed during the loop executions, depending on the values of `n` and `s` provided in each iteration.
