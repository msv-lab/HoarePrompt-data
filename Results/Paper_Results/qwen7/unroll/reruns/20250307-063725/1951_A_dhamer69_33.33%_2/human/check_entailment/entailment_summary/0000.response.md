Reasoning:
The given program (function `func`) is not related to the provided problem description and the code snippet that needs to be evaluated. The problem description and the execution summary describe a different program that deals with generating `.py` files from `.html` files in specified directories. However, the provided function `func` is designed to process a series of inputs involving integers and strings and print 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. 

Since the function `func` does not perform any operations related to the original problem description and instead performs a completely different set of operations, it cannot be considered correct for the given task.

Correctness: **False**
