Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a boolean value indicating whether the start directory name is less than or equal to the end directory name. Both start and end are integer strings representing valid directory names in the current working directory.**

This means the function checks if the `start` directory name (a digit string) is less than or equal to the `end` directory name (another digit string) based on their lexicographical order, and returns `True` if true, otherwise `False`.
