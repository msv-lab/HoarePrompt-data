Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks to generate `.ac.py` and `.wa.py` files for each `.html` file in the specified range of folders. However, the provided code is a function `func()` that reads input and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. It does not generate any files. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
