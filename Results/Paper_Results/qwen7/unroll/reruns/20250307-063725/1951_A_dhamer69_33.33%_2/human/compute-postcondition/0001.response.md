Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while t > 0:`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer.
   - `t` is an input integer.

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `t` is initially greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be greater than 0**
