Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed by choosing vertices from a regular polygon.
2. For a polygon with \( n \) sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is \( n - 2 \). This is a well-known geometric property.
3. Given that Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices, the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose is limited by \( y \). However, since \( y = 0 \) in this version, no additional vertices can be chosen.
4. Therefore, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out is simply the number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) chosen vertices, which is \( x - 2 \).
5. The provided code correctly prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case, which matches the expected solution.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
