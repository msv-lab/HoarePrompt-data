Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing additional vertices. However, the current implementation simply prints `x - 2`, where `x` is the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. This is a constant value and does not depend on the values of the chosen vertices or the constraints provided by `n`, `x`, and `y`.

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  8 4 0
  1 6 2 5
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output (from the provided program):
  ```
  2
  ```

While the output is correct for this specific test case, the program does not account for the fact that the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces can vary depending on the positions of the chosen vertices. For instance, if the chosen vertices were `1, 3, 5, 7`, the program would still output `2`, which is incorrect because we can form 4 non-intersecting triangular pieces.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces, making it incorrect.
