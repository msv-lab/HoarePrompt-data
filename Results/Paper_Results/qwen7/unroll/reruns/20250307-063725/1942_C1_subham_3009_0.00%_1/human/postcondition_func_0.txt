The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers t, n, x, and y, where t indicates the number of test cases, n and x have specific constraints, and y is always 0. It then reads x distinct integers representing vertices and prints the value of x - 2. After processing all test cases, it ensures that the variable t is set to 0.
