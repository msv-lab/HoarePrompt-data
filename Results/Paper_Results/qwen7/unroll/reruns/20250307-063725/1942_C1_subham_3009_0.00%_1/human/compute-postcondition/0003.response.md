Output State: **The value of `t` is 0, and the loop has printed the value of `x-2` for each test case.**

Explanation: The loop runs as long as `t` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1, and then the loop processes the input for the current test case. After processing all test cases (i.e., when `t` becomes 0), the loop terminates. For each test case, the loop prints the value of `x - 2`. Therefore, after all iterations, `t` will be 0, and the loop will have printed `x - 2` for each test case.
