Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each test case, it processes integers n, x, and y (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 ⋅ 10^5), y = 0). The vertices are represented as x distinct integers from 1 to n, and the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. For each test case, the function returns information based on the values of n, x, and y.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific integers, and returns information derived from these integers without needing any parameters passed directly to the function.
