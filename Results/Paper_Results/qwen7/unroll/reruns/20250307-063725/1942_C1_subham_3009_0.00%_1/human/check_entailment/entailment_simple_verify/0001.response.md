### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - The cake is a regular polygon with \( n \) sides.
   - Bessie has already chosen \( x \) vertices.
   - We can choose up to \( y \) additional vertices, but in this version, \( y = 0 \).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices.
   - If we have \( x \) chosen vertices, we can form at most \( x - 2 \) triangles because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and we need to leave at least 2 vertices unused to ensure non-intersecting diagonals.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), but since \( y = 0 \), it is ignored.
   - It then reads the chosen vertices and prints \( x - 2 \).

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code is correct for the given constraints. Since \( y = 0 \), the code correctly calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the \( x \) chosen vertices.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the implementation:
     - The code reads the chosen vertices but does not use them to form triangles. Instead, it simply prints \( x - 2 \) for each test case, regardless of the actual vertices chosen.
     - This means the code does not actually check if the chosen vertices can form non-intersecting triangles. It assumes that any set of \( x \) vertices can always form \( x - 2 \) triangles, which is not necessarily true.

5. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided:
     - Test Case 1: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 0 \). Chosen vertices: \( 1, 6, 2, 5 \).
       - According to the code, the output is \( 4 - 2 = 2 \).
     - However, the correct number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with these vertices is 2, which matches the output.
     - But consider another scenario where the chosen vertices do not form non-intersecting triangles:
       - Test Case 2: \( n = 8 \), \( x = 8 \), \( y = 0 \). Chosen vertices: \( 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8 \).
         - According to the code, the output is \( 8 - 2 = 6 \).
         - However, the correct number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed with these vertices is 0, not 6.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. While the logic for calculating the maximum number of triangles is correct, the program does not verify if the chosen vertices can actually form non-intersecting triangles. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
