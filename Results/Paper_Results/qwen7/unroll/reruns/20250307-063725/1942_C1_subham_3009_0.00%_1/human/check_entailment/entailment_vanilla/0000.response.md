### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.
   - The cake is a regular polygon with `n` sides.
   - Bessie has already chosen `x` vertices.
   - We can choose up to `y` additional vertices, but in this version, `y = 0`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To form a triangle, we need 3 vertices.
   - If we have `x` chosen vertices, we can form at most `x - 2` triangles because each triangle uses 3 vertices, and we need to leave at least 2 vertices unused to ensure non-intersecting diagonals.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y`, but since `y = 0`, it is ignored.
   - It then reads the chosen vertices and prints `x - 2`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the code is correct for the given constraints. Since `y = 0`, the code correctly calculates the maximum number of triangles that can be formed using the `x` chosen vertices.
   - The formula `x - 2` is correct for forming non-intersecting triangles.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
