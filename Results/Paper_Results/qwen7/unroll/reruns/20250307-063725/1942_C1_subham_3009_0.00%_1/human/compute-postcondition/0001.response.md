Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and we have read one test case value for `t`.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer value for `t` from the input, which is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. After executing this line, the value of `t` is updated to the input value, and the remaining conditions and constraints on `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged.
