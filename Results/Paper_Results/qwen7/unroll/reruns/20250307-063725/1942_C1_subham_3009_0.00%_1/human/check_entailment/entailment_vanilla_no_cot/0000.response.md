Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program attempts to print `x - 2` for every test case, which is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the goal is to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing up to `y` additional vertices, where `y = 0` in this version. 

Given that `y = 0`, the only way to form triangles is to use the vertices Bessie has already chosen. For a polygon with `n` sides, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed using any subset of its vertices is `n - 3`. However, since we are limited to the `x` vertices Bessie has chosen, the maximum number of triangles we can form is `x - 2` if `x >= 3`.

The program should calculate and print `x - 2` only if `x >= 3`, otherwise, it should print `0` because fewer than 3 vertices cannot form a triangle. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        t = int(input())
        while t > 0:
            t -= 1
            [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
            arr = input().split()
            arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
            if x >= 3:
                print(x - 2)
            else:
                print(0)
```

This corrected version checks if `x` is at least 3 before attempting to form triangles and prints the appropriate number of triangles accordingly.
