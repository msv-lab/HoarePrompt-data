Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1` which takes the necessary parameters (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`) and aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets.
2. It initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the ticket prices and their respective days. This helps in always processing the cheapest tickets first.
3. The program iteratively pops the cheapest ticket from the priority queue, calculates the effective price considering the price increase, and buys up to `m` tickets (or the remaining tickets needed to reach `k`).
4. The price increase is correctly applied after each purchase, ensuring that the price for subsequent tickets increases as per the problem statement.
5. The logic to ensure that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any given day is correctly implemented.
6. The total cost is accumulated correctly, and the function returns the final total cost.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
