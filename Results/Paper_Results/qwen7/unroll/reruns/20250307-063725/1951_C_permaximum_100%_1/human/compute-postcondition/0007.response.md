Output State: **The program returns total_cost which is the sum of prices for buying k tickets, with the price increasing by k for each subsequent ticket.**

This means that if the initial cost of the first ticket is \( x \), then the total cost would be calculated as \( x + (x+k) + (x+2k) + ... \) up to k terms. However, since the initial cost \( x \) is not provided, we only know that the total cost increases by k for each additional ticket bought.
