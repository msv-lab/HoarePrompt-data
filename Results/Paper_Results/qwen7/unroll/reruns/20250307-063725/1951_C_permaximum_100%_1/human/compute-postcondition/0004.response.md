Output State: **`tickets_bought` is 0, `total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `price_increase` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `price_increase` to 0. This does not affect the values of `tickets_bought`, `total_cost`, `pq`, `n`, `m`, or `k`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
