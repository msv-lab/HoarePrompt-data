Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end.**

The code creates a list of tuples named `pq`. Each tuple in this list contains two elements: the price of a ticket for a specific day (taken from the `prices` list) and the index of that day. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and the corresponding price for each day. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged.
