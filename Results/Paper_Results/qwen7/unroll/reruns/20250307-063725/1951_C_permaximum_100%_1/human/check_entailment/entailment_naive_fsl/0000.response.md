Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of tickets to be bought (`k`) is greater than the product of `m` and `n`. In such cases, the program will attempt to buy more tickets than allowed per day, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
5 2 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will attempt to buy 7 tickets with a maximum of 2 tickets per day. However, after buying 4 tickets (2 tickets on each of the first two days), the price increase will make it impossible to buy the remaining 3 tickets within the constraints. The program will not handle this scenario correctly and will likely produce an incorrect result.
