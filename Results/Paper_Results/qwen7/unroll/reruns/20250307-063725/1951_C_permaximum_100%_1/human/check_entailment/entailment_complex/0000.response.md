Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints.
2. The function initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with the prices and indices of the tickets, ensuring that the lowest price tickets are considered first.
3. It iteratively pops the smallest price from the priority queue, calculates the number of tickets to buy (up to `m` or `k - tickets_bought`, whichever is smaller), updates the total cost, and increases the price increase factor.
4. The logic inside the while loop ensures that the price increases appropriately after purchasing tickets on a given day.
5. The function correctly handles the constraints and calculates the total cost accurately.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the function appears to be correctly implementing the logic required to find the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets.

Correctness: **True**
