You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, m is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, k is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and prices is a list of n positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.
def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    pq = [(price, i) for i, price in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        price, day = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        price += price_increase
        
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
        
    #State: tickets_bought is k, total_cost is the sum of prices for buying k tickets considering the price increase per iteration, pq is empty, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, price_increase is k
    return total_cost
    #The program returns total_cost which is the sum of prices for buying k tickets, with the price increasing by k for each subsequent ticket.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sale days), `m` (a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days). It returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of prices for buying `k` tickets, with the price increasing by `k` for each subsequent ticket.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns total_cost which is the sum of prices for buying k tickets, with the price increasing by k for each subsequent ticket.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
