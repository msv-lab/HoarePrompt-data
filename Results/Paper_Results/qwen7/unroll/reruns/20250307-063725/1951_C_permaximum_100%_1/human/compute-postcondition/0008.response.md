Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer representing the number of sale days), `m` (a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end), and `prices` (a list of `n` positive integers representing the price per ticket for each of the upcoming `n` days). It returns `total_cost`, which is the sum of prices for buying `k` tickets, with the price increasing by `k` for each subsequent ticket.**
