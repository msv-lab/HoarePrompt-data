Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` followed by the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Usage**: It uses a priority queue (min-heap) to efficiently get the lowest-priced tickets first. This ensures that the tickets are bought at the lowest possible cost initially.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**: For each day, it calculates the effective price of buying tickets considering the increase in price due to previous purchases. It then buys the maximum number of tickets possible without exceeding `k` tickets in total.

4. **Price Increase Mechanism**: After buying tickets on a particular day, the price for all subsequent days increases by the number of tickets bought on that day.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total cost of purchasing exactly `k` tickets.

Given the structure and logic, the program should work correctly for the provided constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
