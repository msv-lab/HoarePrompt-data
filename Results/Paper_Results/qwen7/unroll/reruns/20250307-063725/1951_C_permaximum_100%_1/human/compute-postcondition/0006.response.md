Output State: **tickets_bought is k, total_cost is the sum of prices for buying k tickets considering the price increase per iteration, pq is empty, n remains unchanged, m remains unchanged, k remains unchanged, price_increase is k**.

Explanation: After the loop finishes executing, `tickets_bought` will be exactly equal to `k` because the loop continues to buy tickets until `tickets_bought` reaches `k`. The `total_cost` will be the sum of the prices for these `k` tickets, taking into account the increasing price per ticket due to the `price_increase` mechanism. The `pq` list will be empty as all elements will have been processed. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The `price_increase` variable will be equal to `k` since it increases by the number of tickets bought (`tickets_to_buy`) in each iteration.
