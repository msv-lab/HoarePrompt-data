The function accepts four parameters: `n` (the number of sale days), `m` (the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day), `k` (the number of tickets to be bought), and `prices` (a list of ticket prices for each day). It calculates and returns the total cost of buying `k` tickets, with the price increasing by `k` for each subsequent ticket. The function uses a priority queue to manage the ticket prices and ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any given day.
