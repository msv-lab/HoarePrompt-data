### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- We need to buy `k` tickets over `n` days.
- Each day, we can buy up to `m` tickets.
- Buying `x` tickets on a day increases the price of tickets on subsequent days by `x`.

#### Provided Program:
```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    prices = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, m, k, prices)
    print(result)

def func_1(n, m, k, prices):
    import heapq
    pq = [(price, i) for (i, price) in enumerate(prices)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    total_cost = 0
    tickets_bought = 0
    price_increase = 0
    while tickets_bought < k:
        (price, day) = heapq.heappop(pq)
        price += price_increase
        tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)
        total_cost += price * tickets_to_buy
        tickets_bought += tickets_to_buy
        price_increase += tickets_to_buy
    return total_cost
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` uses a priority queue to manage ticket prices.
- It ensures that no more than `m` tickets are bought on any given day.
- The price increase is managed correctly, ensuring that the price of tickets increases by the number of tickets bought on the current day.

#### Analysis:
1. **Priority Queue Usage**: The use of a priority queue ensures that the lowest price tickets are bought first, which is optimal.
2. **Ticket Purchase Limit**: The function correctly limits the number of tickets bought per day to `m`.
3. **Price Increase Handling**: The price increase is handled correctly by adding the number of tickets bought to the `price_increase` variable, which is then added to the price of tickets on subsequent days.

Given the above points, the function should handle all scenarios correctly, including when `k` is greater than `m * n`. The function summary accurately describes the behavior of the function, and the implementation matches the described behavior.

#### Example Verification:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
```
1
5 2 7
1 2 3 4 5
```

- Day 1: Buy 2 tickets (cost = 1 * 2 = 2), total cost = 2, tickets bought = 2, price_increase = 2.
- Day 2: Buy 2 tickets (cost = (2 + 2) * 2 = 8), total cost = 2 + 8 = 10, tickets bought = 4, price_increase = 4.
- Day 3: Buy 3 tickets (cost = (3 + 4) * 3 = 21), total cost = 10 + 21 = 31, tickets bought = 7, price_increase = 7.

This example shows that the function correctly handles the scenario where `k` exceeds `m * n` by distributing the purchases across multiple days.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is **inaccurate**. The provided program correctly handles the constraints and scenarios described in the problem statement.

**Final: True**
