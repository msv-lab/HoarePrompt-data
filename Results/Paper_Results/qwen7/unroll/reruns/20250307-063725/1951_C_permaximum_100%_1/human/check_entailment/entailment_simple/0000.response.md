Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets over `n` days, considering the constraints and the price increases.
2. The function `func_1` initializes a priority queue (`pq`) with tuples containing the price and the index of the day.
3. It then iteratively pops the cheapest ticket from the priority queue, calculates the new price considering the price increase, and buys the maximum possible tickets without exceeding `k`.
4. The price increase is updated accordingly after each purchase.
5. The loop continues until `tickets_bought` equals `k`, ensuring that exactly `k` tickets are purchased.
6. The final state of the variables matches the expected behavior, and the function returns the total cost, which is the minimum amount required to buy `k` tickets.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the implementation appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
