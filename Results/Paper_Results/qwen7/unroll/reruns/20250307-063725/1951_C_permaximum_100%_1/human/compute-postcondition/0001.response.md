Output State: **`pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap.**

The `heapq.heapify()` function transforms the list `pq` into a heap in-place, which means it reorganizes the elements of `pq` so that they satisfy the heap property. However, the specific values of the elements in `pq` remain unchanged; only their order within the list is adjusted to meet the heap requirements. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain in their original states as they were not affected by the operation.
