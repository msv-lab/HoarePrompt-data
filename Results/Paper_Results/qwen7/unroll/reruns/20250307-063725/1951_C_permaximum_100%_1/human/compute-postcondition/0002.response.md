Output State: **`total_cost` is 0, `pq` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a price from the `prices` list and its index, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of sale days, `m` is a positive integer representing the maximum amount of tickets purchasable each day, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of tickets to be bought at the end, and `pq` has been transformed into a heap.**

Explanation: The code initializes `total_cost` to 0. No other operations are performed, so the values of `pq`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The heap property of `pq` is also preserved.
