### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it correctly reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the list of ticket prices `prices`.

2. **Priority Queue Usage**:
   - The program uses a priority queue (`heapq`) to keep track of the ticket prices along with their indices.
   - This ensures that the program always processes the cheapest available tickets first, which is crucial for minimizing the total cost.

3. **Ticket Purchase Logic**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of tickets to buy each day (`tickets_to_buy = min(m, k - tickets_bought)`), ensuring that no more than `m` tickets are purchased on any single day.
   - The program updates the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets purchased on the current day.
   - It also correctly updates the `price_increase` for subsequent days based on the number of tickets purchased on the current day.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the number of tickets to be bought exceeds the product of `n` and `m`.
   - The logic ensures that the total cost calculation is accurate even when the number of tickets to be bought is large.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the total cost for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the function summary provided in the original assessment is slightly misleading. Specifically, the function summary states that the function calculates the total cost by increasing the price by `k` for each subsequent ticket, which is not accurate. Instead, the price increases by the number of tickets purchased on the current day (`tickets_to_buy`).

Let's verify this with the example provided:

#### Example Verification:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 3`, `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
  - Day 1: Buy 0 tickets, prices remain [8, 6, 4, 2].
  - Day 2: Buy 0 tickets, prices remain [8, 6, 4, 2].
  - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket, price becomes 4, total cost = 4, remaining prices [3, 4, 2].
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets, price becomes 6, total cost = 4 + 2*6 = 16, remaining prices [3, 4].

- **Test Case 2**: `n = 4`, `m = 2`, `k = 8`, `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`
  - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets, price becomes 16, total cost = 16, remaining prices [16, 6, 4].
  - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets, price becomes 16, total cost = 16 + 2*16 = 48, remaining prices [16, 12].
  - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets, price becomes 16, total cost = 48 + 2*16 = 80, remaining prices [16, 12].
  - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets, price becomes 16, total cost = 80 + 2*16 = 112, remaining prices [16].

The provided function correctly updates the price increase based on the number of tickets purchased each day, not by a fixed increment of `k`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum amount of money needed to purchase exactly `k` tickets under the given constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

Final: **True**
