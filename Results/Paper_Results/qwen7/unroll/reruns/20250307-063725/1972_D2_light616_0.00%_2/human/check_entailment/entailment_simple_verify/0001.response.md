### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the annotated code step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Initial State**: `x` starts from 1, and `cnt` is initialized to 0. `n` and `m` are read from the input.
- **Outer Loop**: Iterates `x` from 1 to the square root of `n` (`x * x <= n`).
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates `y` from 1 to a value such that `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- **GCD Check**: Checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
- **Count Update**: Adds `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` to `cnt`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- Calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

#### Calculation of Valid Pairs
- The logic in `func_1` attempts to find pairs `(x, y)` where `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` ensures that `x` and `y` are coprime.
- The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is used to count valid pairs, but it does not directly relate to the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b`.

#### Example Test Cases
- **Test Case 1**: `n = 1, m = 1`
  - No valid pairs exist, which is correct.
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 2, m = 3`
  - The only valid pair is `(2, 2)`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 3, m = 5`
  - The only valid pair is `(3, 3)`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 4**: `n = 10, m = 8`
  - Valid pairs are `(2, 2)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 4)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 6)`, `(8, 8)`, which is correct.
- **Test Case 5**: `n = 100, m = 1233`
  - The output is `423`, but this seems incorrect because the expected output should be `423` based on the problem statement, but the logic might be flawed.
- **Test Case 6**: `n = 1000000, m = 1145141`
  - The output is `5933961`, but again, the logic might be flawed.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Condition**: The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is too restrictive and does not guarantee that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
2. **Expression Usage**: The expression `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` does not directly relate to the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b`.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
2. Check if `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

### Final Evaluation
Given the issues identified, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
