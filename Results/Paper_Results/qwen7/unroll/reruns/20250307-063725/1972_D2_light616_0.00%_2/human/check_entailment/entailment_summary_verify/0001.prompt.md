You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases, each involving two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and an integer \(t\). For each test case, it invokes `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - For each valid pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to the count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

#### Calculation of Valid Pairs
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be attempting to find pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
- However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
  - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` does not necessarily ensure that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. This condition is too restrictive.
  - The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` might not be appropriate. This expression does not directly relate to the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b`.

#### Example Test Cases
- Let's verify the example test cases provided:
  - **Test Case 1**: `n = 1, m = 1`
    - No valid pairs exist, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 2**: `n = 2, m = 3`
    - The only valid pair is `(2, 2)`, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 3**: `n = 3, m = 5`
    - The only valid pair is `(3, 3)`, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 4**: `n = 10, m = 8`
    - Valid pairs are `(2, 2)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 4)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 6)`, `(8, 8)`, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 5**: `n = 100, m = 1233`
    - The output is `423`, but this seems incorrect because the expected output should be `423` based on the problem statement, but the logic might be flawed.
  - **Test Case 6**: `n = 1000000, m = 1145141`
    - The output is `5933961`, but again, the logic might be flawed.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. The current implementation has logical errors and does not accurately solve the problem as described.
