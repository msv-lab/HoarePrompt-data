Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` for a given `n` and `m`.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of `x` and `y` such that `x * x <= n` and `(x + y) * x <= n` and `(x + y) * y <= m`.
   - For each valid pair `(x, y)`, it checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - If the condition is met, it adds the minimum of `n / ((x + y) * x)` and `m // ((x + y) * y)` to the count `cnt`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then calls `func_1` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

#### Calculation of Valid Pairs
- The logic in `func_1` seems to be attempting to find pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`.
- However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
  - The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` does not necessarily ensure that `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. This condition is too restrictive.
  - The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` might not be appropriate. This expression does not directly relate to the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b`.

#### Example Test Cases
- Let's verify the example test cases provided:
  - **Test Case 1**: `n = 1, m = 1`
    - No valid pairs exist, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 2**: `n = 2, m = 3`
    - The only valid pair is `(2, 2)`, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 3**: `n = 3, m = 5`
    - The only valid pair is `(3, 3)`, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 4**: `n = 10, m = 8`
    - Valid pairs are `(2, 2)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 4)`, `(6, 3)`, `(6, 6)`, `(8, 8)`, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 5**: `n = 100, m = 1233`
    - The output is `423`, but this seems incorrect because the expected output should be `423` based on the problem statement, but the logic might be flawed.
  - **Test Case 6**: `n = 1000000, m = 1145141`
    - The output is `5933961`, but again, the logic might be flawed.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` where `b * gcd(a, b)` is a multiple of `a + b`. The current implementation has logical errors and does not accurately solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
