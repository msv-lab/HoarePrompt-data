### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function aims to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
- The logic iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) using nested loops.
- The condition `x * x <= n` ensures that \(x\) is within the valid range.
- The inner loop iterates over \(y\) such that \((x + y) * x \leq n\) and \((x + y) * y \leq m\).
- For each valid pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\text{gcd}(x, y) == 1\).
- If the condition is met, it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) to the count `cnt`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Input Handling
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.

#### Calculation of Valid Pairs
- The logic in `func_1` attempts to find pairs \((a, b)\) where \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The condition `math.gcd(x, y) == 1` is intended to ensure that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, but it does not guarantee that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The use of `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not directly related to the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Example Test Cases
- Let's verify the example test cases provided:
  - **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1, m = 1\)
    - No valid pairs exist, which is correct.
  - **Test Case 2**: \(n = 2, m = 3\)
    - The only valid pair is \((2, 2)\), which is correct.
  - **Test Case 3**: \(n = 3, m = 5\)
    - The only valid pair is \((3, 3)\), which is correct.
  - **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10, m = 8\)
    - Valid pairs are \((2, 2)\), \((3, 6)\), \((4, 4)\), \((6, 3)\), \((6, 6)\), \((8, 8)\), which is correct.
  - **Test Case 5**: \(n = 100, m = 1233\)
    - The output is `423`, but this seems incorrect because the expected output should be `423` based on the problem statement, but the logic might be flawed.
  - **Test Case 6**: \(n = 1000000, m = 1145141\)
    - The output is `5933961`, but again, the logic might be flawed.

### Conclusion

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\). The current implementation has logical errors and does not accurately solve the problem as described.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
