Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not properly checked in the inner loop. Specifically, the current implementation checks if `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is not the correct condition. Instead, it should check if `(x + y) * y * math.gcd(x, y)` is a multiple of `a + b`.

2. **Boundary Conditions**: The current implementation calculates `cnt` using `min(n / ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))`, which does not correctly count the number of valid pairs. It should be checking the condition more accurately.

3. **Efficiency**: The current approach is inefficient due to the nested loops and the way the gcd is checked. A more efficient approach would involve iterating through possible values of `d = gcd(a, b)` and then counting the valid pairs.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    return math.gcd(a, b)

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for d in range(1, n + 1):
        # Find the smallest a such that d divides a
        a = d
        while a <= n:
            b = (a + d - 1) // d  # Find the smallest b such that d divides b
            while b * d <= m:
                if (a + b) % d == 0:
                    cnt += 1
                b += d
            a += d
    return cnt

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version uses a more efficient approach to count the valid pairs by iterating through possible values of `d = gcd(a, b)` and checking the conditions more accurately.
