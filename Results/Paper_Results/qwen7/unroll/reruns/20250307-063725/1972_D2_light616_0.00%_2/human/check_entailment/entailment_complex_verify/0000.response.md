### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts at 1.
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0.
   - `n` and `m` are read from the input.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - The loop runs while \( x \times x \leq n \).
   - This ensures that \( x \) is within a reasonable range.

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - `y` starts at 1.
   - The inner loop runs while \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).
   - This ensures that both \( x \) and \( y \) are within their respective bounds.

4. **GCD Check**:
   - If \(\text{gcd}(x, y) == 1\), the pair \((x, y)\) is considered.
   
5. **Calculation**:
   - The expression \(\text{min}(n / ((x + y) \times x), m // ((x + y) \times y))\) is calculated.
   - This expression checks if \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \) (where \( a = x \) and \( b = y \)) is a multiple of \( a + b \).
   - The result is added to `cnt`.

6. **Output**:
   - After the loops complete, `cnt` is printed, which represents the total count of valid pairs for the given \( n \) and \( m \).

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from the input, representing the number of test cases.

2. **Loop for Test Cases**:
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, `func_1` is called with the current test case's \( n \) and \( m \).

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all test cases, the program ends without returning any value.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points.
- The logic in `func_1` accurately checks the conditions for valid pairs \((x, y)\).
- The bounds and gcd check are correctly implemented.
- The overall structure of the program matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\), checks the conditions, and counts the valid pairs. The logic is sound, and the program handles the constraints appropriately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
