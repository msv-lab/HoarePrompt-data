Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a given \(n\) and \(m\). It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) under the constraints and checks the condition using the greatest common divisor (gcd).
   - **func_2()**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it calls `func_1()` with the appropriate \(n\) and \(m\).

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, ensuring that the calculations do not exceed the limits specified (i.e., \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and the sum of \(n\) and \(m\) does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\)).
   - The use of `math.gcd` ensures that the gcd condition is checked correctly.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The output for each test case is the correct count of valid pairs, as verified by the example provided in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution for the problem and handles all the constraints and edge cases as required.

Correctness: **True**
