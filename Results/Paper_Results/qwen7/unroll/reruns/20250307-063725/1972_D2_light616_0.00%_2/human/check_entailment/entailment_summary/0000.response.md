Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy specific conditions.
- There are two functions provided: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
- `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The provided execution summaries correctly describe the behavior of both functions.
- `func_1` iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) within the constraints and checks if \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\). If true, it adds the minimum of \(\frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x}\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\) to the count.
- `func_2` correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one.
- Given the constraints and the logic, both functions together should correctly solve the problem as described.

Based on the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
