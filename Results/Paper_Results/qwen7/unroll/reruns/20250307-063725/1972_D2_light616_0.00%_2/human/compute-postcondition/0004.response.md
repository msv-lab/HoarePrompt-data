Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two integers, n and m, and an integer t. The integer t ranges from 1 to 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers between 1 and 2⋅10^6, with the constraint that n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases. The function returns results based on the values of n, m, and t for each test case.**
