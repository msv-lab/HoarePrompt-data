State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(0)` would result in no iterations.
3. Additionally, `t` is constrained by the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
4. Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it satisfies these conditions.

Thus, the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
