Reasoning:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the constraints \(x \cdot x \leq n\), \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\), and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). It also ensures that \(\text{gcd}(x, y) = 1\) before counting the pair. The result is printed at the end of the function.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function correctly handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. Since `func_1()` is designed to handle individual pairs \((n, m)\), calling it \(t\) times per test case will process all required test cases correctly.

Given the problem description and the provided annotations, both functions together correctly implement the solution. They handle the input, process each test case appropriately, and produce the correct output as per the example provided.

Correctness: **True**
