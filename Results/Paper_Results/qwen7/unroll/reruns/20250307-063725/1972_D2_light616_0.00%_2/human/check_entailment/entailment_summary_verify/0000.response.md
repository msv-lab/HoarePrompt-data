### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to validate the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Function Summaries:
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function processes a series of test cases, each involving two integers \(n\) and \(m\), and an integer \(t\). It calls `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times for each test case.

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - The function uses nested loops to iterate through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It checks if \(x + y \leq \sqrt{n}\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - If \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), it increments the count by the minimum of \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\).

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Bounds Check**: The loop bounds for \(x\) and \(y\) are set such that \(x \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\). These bounds ensure that the values of \(x\) and \(y\) do not exceed the limits of \(n\) and \(m\).
- **GCD Check**: The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime, which is a necessary condition for the problem.
- **Count Calculation**: The count is incremented by the minimum of \(n / ((x + y) \cdot x)\) and \(m // ((x + y) \cdot y)\). This ensures that the count is adjusted based on the smallest possible value that satisfies the condition.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to be correct. The function summaries also align with the expected behavior of the functions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the solution for the given problem, and the function summaries support this conclusion.
