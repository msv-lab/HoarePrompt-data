Output State: **i is greater than j.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Inside the loop, if the elements at positions `i` and `j` are the same, both `i` and `j` are adjusted (`i` is incremented and `j` is decremented). If they are not the same, the loop breaks immediately. After the loop completes, `i` will always be greater than `j`, meaning the condition `i <= j` is no longer true, which is the natural conclusion of the described loop operation.
