Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Selection**: The function `func_1` checks if the first and last elements are the same and then tries to find the first and last positions where the elements differ. This approach doesn't guarantee the minimum cost operation.

2. **Cost Calculation**: The function returns `j - i + 1` which represents the length of the subarray between `i` and `j`. However, it doesn't consider whether this operation would actually make all elements equal or if there's a better subarray to choose.

3. **Missing Consideration of Different Values**: The function only considers the first and last differing elements without checking other possible subarrays that might have a lower cost.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Identify the distinct values in the array.
- For each distinct value, find the minimum cost to make all elements of that value equal.
- Return the minimum cost among all these operations.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(min_cost_to_equalize(arr))
    t -= 1

def min_cost_to_equalize(arr):
    value_count = {}
    for value in arr:
        if value in value_count:
            value_count[value].append(value)
        else:
            value_count[value] = [value]
    
    min_cost = float('inf')
    for values in value_count.values():
        if len(values) > 1:
            for i in range(len(values) - 1):
                cost = (values[i+1] - values[i]) + 1
                min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

```

This solution correctly identifies the distinct values and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of each value equal.
