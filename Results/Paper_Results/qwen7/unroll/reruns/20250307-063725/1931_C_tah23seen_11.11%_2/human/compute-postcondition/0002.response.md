Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1.
3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.

Given the current state:
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is the length of `arr` minus 1.

For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 0) must be less than or equal to `j` (which is the length of `arr` minus 1).

Since `i` is already 0, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that `j` is at least 0. If `j` were negative, the loop condition would never be satisfied.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `j` is non-negative.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 0; `j` must be greater than or equal to 0**
