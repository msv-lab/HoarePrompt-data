Output State: i points to the first element in arr that is different from the previous element or is out of bounds.

Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. This means that `i` will keep increasing until it reaches an index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or until `i + 1` exceeds the length of the array `arr`. After the loop finishes, `i` will point to either the first element that is different from its predecessor or it will be out of bounds if all elements were identical.
