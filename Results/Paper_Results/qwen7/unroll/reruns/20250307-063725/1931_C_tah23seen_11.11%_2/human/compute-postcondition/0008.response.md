Output State: i points to the first element in arr that is different from the previous element or is out of bounds.

Explanation: The loop increments `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. This means that after the loop finishes executing, `i` will be at the position of the first element that is different from its predecessor, or it will have exceeded the array bounds if all elements were the same.
