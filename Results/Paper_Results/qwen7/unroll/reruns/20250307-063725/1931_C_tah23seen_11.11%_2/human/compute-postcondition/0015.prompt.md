You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i is greater than j.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: i is greater than j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: i points to the first element in arr that is different from the previous element or is out of bounds.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues to increment `i` as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. This means that `i` will keep increasing until it reaches an index where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`, or until `i + 1` exceeds the length of the array `arr`. After the loop finishes, `i` will point to either the first element that is different from its predecessor or it will be out of bounds if all elements were identical.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the number of elements from index `i` to index `j-1` in the list `arr`
    #State: `i` points to the first element in `arr` that is different from the previous element or is out of bounds, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` - 1
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the length of list 'arr' minus 1 and the index 'i' that points to the first element in 'arr' which is different from the previous element or is out of bounds.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. It returns 0 in some cases, the count of elements from index i to index j-1 in the list arr in other cases, and the difference between the length of list arr minus 1 and the index i pointing to the first element in arr which is different from the previous element or is out of bounds in yet another case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the number of elements from index `i` to index `j-1` in the list `arr`

Case_3: The program returns the difference between the length of list 'arr' minus 1 and the index 'i' that points to the first element in 'arr' which is different from the previous element or is out of bounds.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
