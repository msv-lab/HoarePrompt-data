### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the array `arr` correctly from the input.
3. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` which is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail using the provided annotations:

- **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
  - The function starts by finding the first mismatch from both ends of the array.
  - If the entire array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same), it returns 0.
  - If there is a mismatch, it calculates the cost of making all elements between the first mismatched indices equal to the element at index `i`.
  - The function logic is flawed because:
    - It incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost is simply the distance between the first mismatched indices (`j - i + 1`).
    - It does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing different segments of the array.
    - It does not handle cases where the array can be made uniform by a single operation effectively.

To verify the correctness, let's consider some examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
- Expected Output: `4`

- **Function Execution**:
  - `i = 0`, `j = 5`
  - First mismatch found at `i = 0` and `j = 5` (1 ≠ 1)
  - `j - i + 1 = 5 - 0 + 1 = 6`
  - Return `6`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
- Expected Output: `0`

- **Function Execution**:
  - `i = 0`, `j = 5`
  - Entire array is uniform, so return `0`.

#### Example 3:
- Input: `[8, 8, 8, 1, 2, 8, 8, 8]`
- Expected Output: `2`

- **Function Execution**:
  - `i = 3`, `j = 5`
  - Mismatch found at `i = 3` and `j = 5` (1 ≠ 8)
  - `j - i + 1 = 5 - 3 + 1 = 3`
  - Return `3`

From these examples, it is clear that the function is not correctly calculating the minimum cost. The function only considers the first mismatch and does not explore other possible segments or operations to minimize the cost.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to consider all possible ways to make the array uniform with the minimum cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
