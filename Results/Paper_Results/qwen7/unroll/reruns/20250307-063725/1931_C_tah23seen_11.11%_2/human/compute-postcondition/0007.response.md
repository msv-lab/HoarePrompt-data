Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Determine the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `arr`.
3. **Current state before the loop**: `i` is greater than `j`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must be true.

Given that `i` is greater than `j`, we need to ensure that the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` holds true for the first iteration of the loop. Since `i` is already greater than `j`, we need to make sure that `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are equal.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `arr[i]` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is greater than `j` and `arr[i]` must be equal to `arr[i + 1]`**
