Output State: **The program returns the number of elements from index `i` to index `j-1` in the list `arr`**.

This means that the program calculates the length of the sublist starting from the index pointed to by `i` (inclusive) to the index `j` (exclusive). Since `j` is not equal to the length of `arr` - 1, `j` is within the bounds of the list, and thus the calculation `j - i + 1` gives the number of elements in this sublist.
