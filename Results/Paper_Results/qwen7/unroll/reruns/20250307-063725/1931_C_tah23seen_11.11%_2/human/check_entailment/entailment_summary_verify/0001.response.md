### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct and well-implemented.

2. **Array Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the array `arr` correctly from the input. This is also correct.

3. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` which is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. However, the function `func_1` has several issues as described in the original assessment.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by finding the first mismatch from both ends of the array. This part is correct.
   - If the entire array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same), it returns 0. This is correct.
   - If there is a mismatch, it calculates the cost of making all elements between the first mismatched indices equal to the element at index `i`. This is where the function is flawed.
   - The function logic assumes that the minimum cost is simply the distance between the first mismatched indices (`j - i + 1`). This is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing different segments of the array.
   - The function does not handle cases where the array can be made uniform by a single operation effectively. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]` and we choose `i = 2`, `j = 4`, and `x = 8`, the cost would be 3 burles, but the function returns 4 burles.

The function `func_1` does not explore all possible ways to make the array uniform with the minimum cost. It only considers the first segment and does not account for other potential operations that could result in a lower cost.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach should involve identifying the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which might require considering multiple operations or different segments of the array. The current implementation only considers the first segment and does not explore other possibilities.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to consider all possible ways to make the array uniform with the minimum cost.

**Final: False**
