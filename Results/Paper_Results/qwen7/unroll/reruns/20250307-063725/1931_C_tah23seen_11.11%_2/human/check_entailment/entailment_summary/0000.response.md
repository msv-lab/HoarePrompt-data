Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where all elements from index `i` to `j` are set to `x`. The cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by checking if the entire array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it returns 0.
   - It then checks if there are consecutive elements that are the same starting from the beginning of the array. If such elements exist, it increments the index `i` until it finds a different element.
   - Finally, it checks if there are any elements left in the array after `i`. If there are, it returns `j - i + 1` (the length of the remaining part of the array), otherwise, it returns `j - i`.

3. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The function does not consider the possibility of setting all elements to a specific value `x` within the range `[i, j]` to minimize the cost.
   - The logic does not handle the case where the array needs to be made uniform by setting a segment of the array to a common value `x` and then possibly another segment to a different value `y`.
   - The function only checks for uniform segments from the start and end of the array and does not explore other possible segmentations.

Given these points, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
