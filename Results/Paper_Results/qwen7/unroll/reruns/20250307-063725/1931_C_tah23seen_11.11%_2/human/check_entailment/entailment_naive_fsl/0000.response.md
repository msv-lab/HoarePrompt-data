Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in `func_1` does not account for the actual operations needed to make all elements equal. Specifically, the function only checks if the first and last elements are equal and then tries to find the longest sequence of equal elements starting from the first element. This approach does not consider the optimal way to perform the operations to minimize the cost.

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The correct solution would involve selecting `i = 1`, `j = 4`, and `x = 2` to change the array to `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]`, and then selecting `i = 5`, `j = 5`, and `x = 2` to change the last element to 2. The total cost would be `(4 - 1 + 1) + 1 = 5` burles. However, the provided function would incorrectly return `4` because it only considers the longest sequence of equal elements starting from the first element.

To correctly solve this problem, a more complex algorithm is needed, such as identifying the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculating the optimal segments to change to these values.
