Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then checks if the elements at these pointers are equal. If they are, it moves both pointers inward. If not, it breaks the loop.
   - After exiting the loop, if `i` is greater than `j`, it means all elements are the same, so it returns `0`.
   - Otherwise, it enters another loop to skip consecutive identical elements starting from `i`.
   - Finally, it checks if `j` is still within bounds and returns the distance between `i` and `j` if so, otherwise it returns `j - i`.

3. **Output**:
   - The function correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by identifying the longest subarray with the same value and calculating the cost of changing the rest of the array to match this subarray.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios including arrays with all elements the same, arrays with some elements the same, and arrays with no elements the same.
   - The function passes all these test cases as indicated by the expected outputs.

Given the analysis, the function logic is sound and it correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
