The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0, the count of elements from index `i` to index `j-1` in the list `arr`, or the difference between the length of list `arr` minus 1 and the index `i` pointing to the first element in `arr` which is different from the previous element or is out of bounds.
