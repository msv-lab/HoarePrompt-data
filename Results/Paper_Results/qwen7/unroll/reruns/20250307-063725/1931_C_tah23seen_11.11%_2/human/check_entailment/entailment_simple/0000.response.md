Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then checks if the elements at these two pointers are the same. If they are, it moves both pointers inward until they meet or the elements differ.
   - If all elements are the same (`i > j`), it returns 0, indicating no operations are needed.
   - If the elements at `i` and `i+1` are the same, it skips over consecutive identical elements by incrementing `i`.
   - Finally, it returns the minimum cost to make all elements equal by considering the segment from `i` to `j`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where all elements in the array are the same by returning 0.
   - It also correctly identifies the segment of the array that needs to be changed to make all elements equal, and calculates the cost accurately.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(arr)` for each test case, which is the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal.

Given the logic and handling of edge cases, the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided states.

Correctness: **True**
