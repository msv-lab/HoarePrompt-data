Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes the array `arr` correctly from the input.
3. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1(arr)` which is supposed to calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.
4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by finding the first mismatch from both ends of the array.
   - If the entire array is uniform (i.e., all elements are the same), it returns 0.
   - If there is a mismatch, it calculates the cost of making all elements between the first mismatched indices equal to the element at index `i`.
   - The function logic seems to be flawed because:
     - It incorrectly assumes that the minimum cost is simply the distance between the first mismatched indices (`j - i + 1`).
     - It does not account for the possibility of making all elements equal by choosing different segments of the array.
     - It does not handle cases where the array can be made uniform by a single operation effectively.

Given the problem statement, the correct approach should involve identifying the minimum cost to make all elements equal, which might require considering multiple operations or different segments of the array. The current implementation only considers the first segment and does not explore other possibilities.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to consider all possible ways to make the array uniform with the minimum cost.
