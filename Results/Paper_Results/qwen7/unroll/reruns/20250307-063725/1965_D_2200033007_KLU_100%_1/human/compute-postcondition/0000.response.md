Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `len(smallList) > 0` and `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`.
2. **Analyze the conditions**:
   - The first part of the condition, `len(smallList) > 0`, checks if `smallList` has at least one element.
   - The second part of the condition, `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]`, checks if the last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For `len(smallList) > 0` to be true, `smallList` must have at least one element. This means `smallList` cannot be empty.
   - For `bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]` to be true, the last elements of both lists must be equal.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums.
- `smallList` is a list of integers representing the given list of subarray sums excluding one of the sums.

To satisfy the loop condition, we need to ensure that:
- `smallList` is not empty.
- The last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure `smallList` is not empty.
- Ensure `bigList[-1]` is equal to `smallList[-1]`.

State: **`bigList` is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums, and `smallList` is a list of integers representing the given list of subarray sums excluding one of the sums. Both lists contain positive integers, and `smallList` must not be empty and `bigList[-1]` must be equal to `smallList[-1]`.**
