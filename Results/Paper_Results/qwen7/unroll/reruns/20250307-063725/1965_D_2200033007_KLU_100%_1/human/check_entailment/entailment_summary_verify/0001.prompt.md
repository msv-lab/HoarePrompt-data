You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    cts = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        sm = 0
        for j in range(i, len(a)):
            sm = sm + a[j]
            cts.append(sm)
    cts.sort()
    return cts

#Function 2:
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
    return odds

#Function 3:
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        prev = x
        idx = idx - 1
    return a

#Function 4:
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        smallList.pop()
    return bigList[-1]



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 4 : The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`, both containing positive integers. It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as their last elements are equal. After performing these operations, it returns the last element of `bigList`.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a`. It iterates through all possible starting points and ending points of subarrays, calculates their sums, and stores them in a list `cts`. However, it does not handle palindromic properties or ensure that the generated sums are unique.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to filter out duplicate subarray sums from the list `cts`. It uses a simple approach where it checks if the current sum `ct` is equal to the last element in the `odds` list. If they are equal, it removes the last element; otherwise, it appends the current sum to `odds`. This logic assumes that the last element in `odds` is the most recent unique sum, which might not be accurate if the sums are not sorted correctly.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from the filtered list of unique subarray sums `odds`. It starts from the middle of the array and works towards both ends, ensuring symmetry. However, the logic for setting the values in the array might not always produce a valid palindrome, especially if the unique sums do not correspond to valid subarray sums of the palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the provided code and seems to be a placeholder or an unused helper function.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_2`**: The filtering logic in `func_2` assumes that the list `cts` is already sorted, which is not the case. The function should sort the list before filtering duplicates.
- **Function `func_3`**: The logic in `func_3` might not always produce a valid palindrome. For example, if the unique sums do not correspond to valid subarray sums of the palindrome, the constructed array will not be a palindrome.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement using the given functions:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 1]`

1. **Subarray sums**: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
2. **Filtered sums**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
3. **Palindrome construction**: `[1, 2, 1]`

This example works correctly.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 4`, subarray sums: `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
- Expected output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

1. **Subarray sums**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 11, 9, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1]`
2. **Filtered sums**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1]`
3. **Palindrome construction**: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

This example also works correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions have issues with sorting and constructing the palindrome correctly. However, based on the examples provided, the functions seem to work correctly for the given test cases. Given the constraints and the problem statement, the functions might still produce a valid solution.
