Output State: **bigList contains all subarray sums except for the last one, and smallList is empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as `smallList` is not empty and the last elements of both `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. In each iteration, both lists have their last elements removed. This process continues until either `smallList` becomes empty or the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal. Therefore, `bigList` will end up with all its elements except the last one (which was equal to the last element of `smallList` when the loop stopped), and `smallList` will be empty.
