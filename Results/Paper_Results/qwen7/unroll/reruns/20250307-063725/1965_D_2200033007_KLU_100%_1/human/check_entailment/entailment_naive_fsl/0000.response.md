Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's analyze the functions step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums and sorts them. However, it does not handle the input constraints effectively, especially when dealing with large inputs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to remove duplicate subarray sums. However, it does not correctly handle the logic to ensure that only unique sums are retained, leading to potential issues in identifying the missing sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. However, the logic for reconstructing the array is flawed. Specifically, the way indices are handled and the values are assigned do not guarantee that the resulting array will be a palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the provided solution and seems to be a helper function for removing matching elements from two lists, which is not relevant to the main problem.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  1 2 3 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**: Any valid palindrome array, e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`.

- **Actual Output**:
  - Using the provided functions, the output might not be a valid palindrome due to the flawed logic in `func_3`.

For instance, if we run the provided functions with the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, the reconstructed array might not be a palindrome due to incorrect handling of indices and values.

Therefore, the program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
