### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a`. It iterates through all possible starting points and ending points of subarrays, calculates their sums, and stores them in a list `cts`. However, it does not handle palindromic properties or ensure that the generated sums are unique. The function itself is correct in generating all subarray sums, but it does not consider the palindromic nature of the array.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to filter out duplicate subarray sums from the list `cts`. It uses a simple approach where it checks if the current sum `ct` is equal to the last element in the `odds` list. If they are equal, it removes the last element; otherwise, it appends the current sum to `odds`. This logic assumes that the last element in `odds` is the most recent unique sum, which might not be accurate if the sums are not sorted correctly. The function should sort the list before filtering duplicates, but since the input is guaranteed to be sorted, this step is not strictly necessary. However, the logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the last element in `odds` might be a duplicate of a previous element.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from the filtered list of unique subarray sums `odds`. It starts from the middle of the array and works towards both ends, ensuring symmetry. However, the logic for setting the values in the array might not always produce a valid palindrome, especially if the unique sums do not correspond to valid subarray sums of the palindrome. The function assumes that the sums can be split evenly, which is not always true. For example, if the sum of a subarray is odd, it cannot be split evenly into two halves.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the provided code and seems to be a placeholder or an unused helper function.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_2`**: The filtering logic in `func_2` assumes that the list `cts` is already sorted, which is not the case. The function should sort the list before filtering duplicates.
- **Function `func_3`**: The logic in `func_3` might not always produce a valid palindrome. For example, if the unique sums do not correspond to valid subarray sums of the palindrome, the constructed array will not be a palindrome. Additionally, the function assumes that the sums can be split evenly, which is not always true.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement using the given functions:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 1]`

1. **Subarray sums**: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
2. **Filtered sums**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (incorrect, should be `[1, 2, 3, 4]` without duplicates)
3. **Palindrome construction**: `[1, 2, 1]`

This example works correctly, but the filtering logic is flawed.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 4`, subarray sums: `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
- Expected output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

1. **Subarray sums**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 11, 9, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1]`
2. **Filtered sums**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` (incorrect, should be `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` without duplicates)
3. **Palindrome construction**: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

This example also works correctly, but the filtering logic is flawed.

### Conclusion:
The provided functions have issues with sorting and constructing the palindrome correctly. The filtering logic in `func_2` and the assumption in `func_3` that sums can be split evenly are problematic. Based on the examples provided, the functions seem to work correctly for the given test cases, but the logic is flawed and may not always produce a valid solution.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
