### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums for a given array `a`. It iterates through all possible starting points and ending points of subarrays, calculates their sums, and stores them in a list `cts`. However, it does not handle palindromic properties or ensure that the generated sums are unique.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to filter out duplicate subarray sums from the list `cts`. It uses a simple approach where it checks if the current sum `ct` is equal to the last element in the `odds` list. If they are equal, it removes the last element; otherwise, it appends the current sum to `odds`. This logic assumes that the last element in `odds` is the most recent unique sum, which might not be accurate if the sums are not sorted correctly. Additionally, the function does not sort the list `cts` before filtering, which is a critical issue.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from the filtered list of unique subarray sums `odds`. It starts from the middle of the array and works towards both ends, ensuring symmetry. However, the logic for setting the values in the array might not always produce a valid palindrome, especially if the unique sums do not correspond to valid subarray sums of the palindrome. The function assumes that the sums can be split symmetrically, which is not always true.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the provided code and seems to be a placeholder or an unused helper function.

### Issues:
- **Function `func_2`**: The filtering logic in `func_2` assumes that the list `cts` is already sorted, which is not the case. The function should sort the list before filtering duplicates.
- **Function `func_3`**: The logic in `func_3` might not always produce a valid palindrome. For example, if the unique sums do not correspond to valid subarray sums of the palindrome, the constructed array will not be a palindrome.

### Example Analysis:
Let's analyze the example provided in the problem statement using the given functions:

#### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 3`, subarray sums: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 1]`

1. **Subarray sums**: `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
2. **Filtered sums**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]` (after sorting and filtering)
3. **Palindrome construction**: `[1, 2, 1]`

This example works correctly.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 4`, subarray sums: `[18, 2, 11, 9, 7, 11, 7, 2, 9]`
- Expected output: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

1. **Subarray sums**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 11, 9, 9, 7, 7, 5, 5, 3, 3, 1, 1]`
2. **Filtered sums**: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, 1]` (after sorting and filtering)
3. **Palindrome construction**: `[7, 2, 2, 7]`

This example also works correctly.

### Conclusion:
While the provided functions seem to work correctly for the given test cases, the logic in `func_2` and `func_3` is flawed. Specifically, `func_2` should sort the list before filtering duplicates, and `func_3` might not always produce a valid palindrome due to the assumptions made about the sums.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
