You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n, where n is an odd integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, where `a` is now a list of length `n` with elements calculated based on the values in `odds`. The first half of the array `a` is filled such that each element at index `i` (where `0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2`) corresponds to `(odds[i] - prev) // 2` when `i ≠ (n-1)//2`, and directly equals `odds[i]` when `i = (n-1)//2`. The second half of the array `a` mirrors the first half due to the palindrome property. `prev` is the last value from `odds`. `idx` is -1 after the loop completes.
    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where the first half of the list is constructed based on the values in 'odds' and the variable 'prev'. Each element at index 'i' (where '0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2') is calculated as follows: if 'i ≠ (n-1)//2', then 'a[i] = (odds[i] - prev) // 2'; otherwise, 'a[i] = odds[i]'. The second half of the list 'a' is a mirror of the first half due to the palindrome property. The variable 'idx' is set to -1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list 'odds' of integers and an integer 'n'. It returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where the first half is constructed based on the values in 'odds' and a variable 'prev'. Each element at index 'i' (where '0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2') is calculated as (odds[i] - prev) // 2 if 'i ≠ (n-1)//2', and simply as odds[i] if 'i = (n-1)//2'. The second half of the list 'a' mirrors the first half due to the palindrome property.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where the first half of the list is constructed based on the values in 'odds' and the variable 'prev'. Each element at index 'i' (where '0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2') is calculated as follows: if 'i ≠ (n-1)//2', then 'a[i] = (odds[i] - prev) // 2'; otherwise, 'a[i] = odds[i]'. The second half of the list 'a' is a mirror of the first half due to the palindrome property. The variable 'idx' is set to -1 after the loop completes.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
