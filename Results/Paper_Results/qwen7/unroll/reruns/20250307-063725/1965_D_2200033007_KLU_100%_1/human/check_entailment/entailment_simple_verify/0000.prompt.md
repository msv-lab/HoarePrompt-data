You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    500000000 1000000000 500000000 500000000 1000000000

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums. Let's analyze the functions step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function generates all subarray sums and sorts them. However, it does not handle the input constraints effectively, especially when dealing with large inputs.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function aims to remove duplicate subarray sums. However, it does not correctly handle the logic to ensure that only unique sums are retained, leading to potential issues in identifying the missing sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array from the unique subarray sums. However, the logic for reconstructing the array is flawed. Specifically, the way indices are handled and the values are assigned do not guarantee that the resulting array will be a palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is not used in the provided solution and seems to be a helper function for removing matching elements from two lists, which is not relevant to the main problem.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case
- **Input**:
  ```
  3
  1 2 3 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**: Any valid palindrome array, e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`.

- **Actual Output**:
  - Using the provided functions, the output might not be a valid palindrome due to the flawed logic in `func_3`.

For instance, if we run the provided functions with the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 1]`, the reconstructed array might not be a palindrome due to incorrect handling of indices and values.

Therefore, the program does not correctly recover a palindrome array from the given subarray sums for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
