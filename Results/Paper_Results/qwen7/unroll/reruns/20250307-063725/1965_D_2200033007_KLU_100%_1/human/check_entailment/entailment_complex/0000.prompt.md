Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Output

    1 2 1 
    7 2 2 7 
    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of a is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where \(n\) is the size of the original palindrome array.

    #State: Output State: `cts` is a list containing all possible subarray sums of the list `a`. The list `a` contains the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\). Each element in `cts` represents the sum of a subarray from index `i` to index `j` (inclusive) of `a`, where `i` ranges from `0` to `len(a) - 1` and `j` ranges from `i` to `len(a) - 1`.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns the sorted list containing all possible subarray sums of the list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `a` of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. It calculates all possible subarray sums of `a` and stores them in a new list `cts`. After sorting `cts`, the function returns the sorted list containing all these subarray sums.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a. Each element in cts is an integer within the range \(1 \leq s_i \leq 10^9\).

    #State: odds is a list containing all elements from `cts` except those that are equal to the last element of `odds` at the time of their addition.
    return odds
    #The program returns the list `odds` which contains all elements from `cts` except those that are equal to the last element of `odds` at the time of their addition.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `cts` and returns a new list `odds`. This list `odds` contains all elements from `cts` except those that are the same as the last element added to `odds` at the time of their addition.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n, where n is an odd integer (3 ≤ n ≤ 1000).
def func_3(odds, n):

        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, where `a` is now a list of length `n` with elements calculated based on the values in `odds`. The first half of the array `a` is filled such that each element at index `i` (where `0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2`) corresponds to `(odds[i] - prev) // 2` when `i ≠ (n-1)//2`, and directly equals `odds[i]` when `i = (n-1)//2`. The second half of the array `a` mirrors the first half due to the palindrome property. `prev` is the last value from `odds`. `idx` is -1 after the loop completes.
    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of length 'n', where the first half of the list is constructed based on the values in 'odds' and the variable 'prev'. Each element at index 'i' (where '0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2') is calculated as follows: if 'i ≠ (n-1)//2', then 'a[i] = (odds[i] - prev) // 2'; otherwise, 'a[i] = odds[i]'. The second half of the list 'a' is a mirror of the first half due to the palindrome property. The variable 'idx' is set to -1 after the loop completes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `odds` of integers and an integer `n`. It constructs a list `a` of length `n` where the first half of the list is populated based on the values in `odds` and a variable `prev`. Each element at index `i` (where `0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2`) is calculated as `(odds[i] - prev) // 2` if `i ≠ (n-1)//2`, and simply as `odds[i]` if `i = (n-1)//2`. The second half of the list `a` mirrors the first half to maintain the palindrome property. After completing the loop, the variable `idx` is set to -1.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums, and smallList is a list of integers representing the given list of subarray sums excluding one of the sums. Both lists contain positive integers.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State: bigList contains all subarray sums except for the last one, and smallList is empty.
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of bigList
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `bigList` and `smallList`, both containing positive integers. It repeatedly removes the last elements from both lists as long as their last elements are equal. After performing these operations, it returns the last element of `bigList`.
