Output State: `odds` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, where `a` is now a list of length `n` with elements calculated based on the values in `odds`. The first half of the array `a` is filled such that each element at index `i` (where `0 ≤ i ≤ (n-1)//2`) corresponds to `(odds[i] - prev) // 2` when `i ≠ (n-1)//2`, and directly equals `odds[i]` when `i = (n-1)//2`. The second half of the array `a` mirrors the first half due to the palindrome property. `prev` is the last value from `odds`. `idx` is -1 after the loop completes.
