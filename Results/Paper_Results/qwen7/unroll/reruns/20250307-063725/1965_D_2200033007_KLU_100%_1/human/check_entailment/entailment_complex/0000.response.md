Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes all possible subarray sums of the given list `a` and returns them in a sorted list `cts`. This is crucial for further processing to find the missing subarray sum.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies and removes duplicate consecutive elements from the list `cts` to form the list `odds`. This step is necessary to identify the unique contributions of subarrays to the overall sum.

3. **Function `func_3`**: This function constructs a palindrome array `a` from the list `odds`. It ensures that the first half of the array is correctly populated based on the values in `odds` and the palindrome property is maintained. This function handles both odd and even-sized arrays correctly.

4. **Function `func_4`**: This function correctly identifies the missing subarray sum by comparing the complete list of subarray sums (`bigList`) with the given list of subarray sums (`smallList`). It ensures that the missing sum is identified accurately by removing matching elements from both lists until the last elements differ.

Given the problem constraints and the logical flow of the program, each function plays a critical role in ensuring that the program can recover a valid palindrome array `a` from the given subarray sums. The program iteratively processes the subarray sums to identify the missing sum and then constructs the palindrome array accordingly.

Therefore, the program is logically sound and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
