Output State: **`n` is an input integer - 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is calculated as (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2 for each testcase, and the result of `s` is printed for each testcase.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `n` and decreases its value by 1. The values of `l` and the calculation for `s` remain unchanged from the initial state. The calculation for `s` is dependent on the value of `l`, which is an input integer, and the result of `s` is printed for each testcase.
