### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and has a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting is not necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distance between two adjacent corners to determine the side length of the square.
   - It computes the distances `p1` and `p2` between pairs of points, which should be equal since all sides of a square are equal.
   - It then calculates the side length using the Pythagorean theorem and multiplies the side lengths to get the area.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to calculate the side length of the square is correct. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will give the side length.
   - However, the code incorrectly calculates the distances `p1` and `p2`. Specifically, it uses the coordinates of the first and second points and the third and fourth points, which may not necessarily be adjacent corners. This could lead to incorrect side length calculations.
   - The correct approach would be to identify the correct pairs of adjacent corners. For example, if the coordinates are sorted, the side length can be calculated as the distance between the first and second points or the third and fourth points, whichever pair is adjacent.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The input constraints are respected (coordinates within the specified range).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation of the code is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the pairs of adjacent corners. The distances `p1` and `p2` should be calculated between adjacent corners, not just any two points.

### Correctness:
**False**
