You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `n` printed results from the loop, where each result is the rounded product of the Euclidean distances between specific pairs of points in a set of 4 points provided by the user. Each set of 4 points is sorted, and the distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points are calculated. These distances are then multiplied together, and the square root of the product is taken before rounding to the nearest integer.
    #
    #The exact numerical values of the output depend on the input coordinates provided within each iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify any particular input values for `n` and `l`, or any specific sets of coordinates, the output can only be described in terms of its general form as outlined above.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and has a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting is not necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distance between two adjacent corners to determine the side length of the square.
   - It computes the distances `p1` and `p2` between pairs of points, which should be equal since all sides of a square are equal.
   - It then calculates the side length using the Pythagorean theorem and multiplies the side lengths to get the area.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to calculate the side length of the square is correct. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will give the side length.
   - The calculation of the area by squaring the side length is also correct.
   - The rounding of the result is appropriate as the area should be an integer.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The input constraints are respected (coordinates within the specified range).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement without any logical errors.
