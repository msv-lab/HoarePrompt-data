Reasoning:

The provided code aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Coordinates**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates, storing them in a list called `coord`.
3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted, which is necessary because the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Sorting helps identify the correct pairs of points that define the sides of the square.
4. **Calculating Distances**: The code calculates the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second points and between the third and fourth points. This is done using the formula \((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2\).
5. **Determining Side Length**: The side length of the square is found by taking the square root of the product of these two distances. This is because the distances represent the lengths of the diagonals of the smaller squares formed by the sides of the original square.
6. **Rounding the Result**: The final result is rounded to the nearest integer before being printed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the code appears to correctly calculate the area of the square for each test case. The sorting step ensures that the correct pairs of points are used to compute the side length, and the rest of the steps logically follow to find the area.

Correctness: **True**
