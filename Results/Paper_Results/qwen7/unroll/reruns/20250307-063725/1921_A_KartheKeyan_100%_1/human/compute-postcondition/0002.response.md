Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `n`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is non-zero (`n != 0`).

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `n` is an input integer - 1.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `s` is calculated as `(l // 4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each testcase, and the result of `s` is printed for each testcase.

4. **Adjust the state of `n`**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is given as "an input integer - 1", it means `n` could be zero if the input integer is 1. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
