Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes \(t\) test cases, where each test case consists of four lines of input. Each line contains two integers \(x_i, y_i\) such that \(-1000 \le x_i, y_i \le 1000\), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. The function returns nothing, but it processes each test case to validate the coordinates and determine if they form a valid square.**

This functionality describes a function that takes no direct parameters but handles multiple test cases, each involving coordinates of a square's corners, to check their validity.
