Output State: The output state will consist of `n` printed results from the loop, where each result is the rounded product of the Euclidean distances between specific pairs of points in a set of 4 points provided by the user. Each set of 4 points is sorted, and the distances between the first and second points and the third and fourth points are calculated. These distances are then multiplied together, and the square root of the product is taken before rounding to the nearest integer.

The exact numerical values of the output depend on the input coordinates provided within each iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify any particular input values for `n` and `l`, or any specific sets of coordinates, the output can only be described in terms of its general form as outlined above.
