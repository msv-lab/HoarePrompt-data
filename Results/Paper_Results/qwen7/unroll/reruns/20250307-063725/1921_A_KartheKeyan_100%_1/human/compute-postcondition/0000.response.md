Output State: **`n` is decreased by 1, `l` is an input integer, `s` is calculated as (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2 for each testcase, and the result of `s` is printed for each testcase.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and calculates `s` as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`. This calculation depends on the value of `l`, which is the side length of a square. The value of `s` is then printed. After processing all test cases, `n` is decreased by 1. The initial values of `x_i` and `y_i` are not used in the code and remain unchanged.
