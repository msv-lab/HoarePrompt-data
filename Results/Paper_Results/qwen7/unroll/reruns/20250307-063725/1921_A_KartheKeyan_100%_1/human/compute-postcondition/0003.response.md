Output State: The output state will consist of `n` printed results from the loop, where each result is the rounded product of the Euclidean distances between two pairs of points, calculated from four input coordinates provided in each iteration of the loop.

Each iteration of the loop processes four pairs of coordinates `(x, y)` provided by the user. It calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second points, and between the third and fourth points, takes the square root of these distances, multiplies them together, and then rounds the result to the nearest integer before printing it. This process repeats `n` times, with `n` being the initial value of the variable `n`.

The output state will be a list of `n` integers, each representing the calculated and rounded product of the distances as described above for each set of four coordinate pairs entered by the user during the loop's iterations.
