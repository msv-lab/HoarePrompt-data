### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and has a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting is not necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distance between two adjacent corners to determine the side length of the square.
   - It computes the distances `p1` and `p2` between pairs of points, which should be equal since all sides of a square are equal.
   - It then calculates the side length using the Pythagorean theorem and multiplies the side lengths to get the area.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to calculate the side length of the square is correct. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will give the side length.
   - However, the code calculates `p1` and `p2` as follows:
     ```python
     p1 = (coord[1][0] - coord[0][0]) ** 2 + (coord[1][1] - coord[0][1]) ** 2
     p2 = (coord[3][0] - coord[2][0]) ** 2 + (coord[3][1] - coord[2][1]) ** 2
     ```
   - This approach assumes that the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, are adjacent corners. However, this is not necessarily true. The correct approach would be to identify the correct pairs of adjacent corners.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly identify the side length, we should check all possible pairs of adjacent corners. For example, we can check the distances between `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, `(x2, y2)` and `(x3, y3)`, etc., and ensure they are equal.
   - The correct way to do this is to find the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates, as the side length of the square will be the same along both axes.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary correctly describes the process of calculating the side length of the square and then computing the area.
   - However, the summary does not mention the need to check all possible pairs of adjacent corners, which is crucial for ensuring the correct side length.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The current implementation may not always correctly identify the side length of the square, especially if the corners are not in a specific order.
   - The code needs to be modified to correctly identify the side length by checking all possible pairs of adjacent corners.
