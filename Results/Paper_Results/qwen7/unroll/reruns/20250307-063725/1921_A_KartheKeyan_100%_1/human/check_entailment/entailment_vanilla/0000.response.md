### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners.
   - The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and has a positive area.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting is not necessary for finding the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the distance between two adjacent corners to determine the side length of the square.
   - It computes the distances `p1` and `p2` between pairs of points, which should be equal since all sides of a square are equal.
   - It then calculates the side length using the Pythagorean theorem and multiplies the side lengths to get the area.
   - The result is rounded and printed.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to calculate the side length of the square is correct. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will give the side length.
   - The calculation of the area by squaring the side length is also correct.
   - The rounding of the result is appropriate as the area should be an integer.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - The input constraints are respected (coordinates within the specified range).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement without any logical errors.
