Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of four pairs of coordinates \((x_i, y_i)\) representing the corners of a square. For each test case, it calculates the Euclidean distance between the first and second points and between the third and fourth points, multiplies these distances, takes the square root of the product, and rounds the result to the nearest integer. It then prints this rounded value for each test case.**
