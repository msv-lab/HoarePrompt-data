Output State: The output state will be a series of strings either "Alice" or "Bob" printed based on the conditions inside the loop.

Explanation: The loop processes `tc` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, then a list of integers, sorts the unique elements in descending order, appends a zero, and checks a condition using dynamic programming (DP) to determine if "Alice" or "Bob" should be printed. After processing all `tc` test cases, the output will consist of "Alice" or "Bob" printed for each test case, depending on whether the condition `dp` was met or not.
