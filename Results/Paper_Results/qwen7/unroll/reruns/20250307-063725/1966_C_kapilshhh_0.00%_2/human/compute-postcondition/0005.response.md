Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` representing the number of piles and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it sorts the unique stones in descending order, appends a zero, and uses a condition to determine if "Alice" or "Bob" should be printed. The function prints "Alice" or "Bob" for each test case based on the outcome of the condition.**
