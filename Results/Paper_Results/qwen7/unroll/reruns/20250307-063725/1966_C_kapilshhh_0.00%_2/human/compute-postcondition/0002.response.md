Output State: The output state will be a series of "Alice" printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `tc`.

Explanation: For each value of `tc`, the loop reads an integer `n`, then takes a space-separated list of integers as input, sorts it in descending order, and appends a `0`. It then checks a condition using dynamic programming (`dp`) to determine if "Alice" should be printed. If the condition is met, "Alice" is printed; otherwise, "Alice" is also printed due to the logical structure of the condition. Since `tc` is decremented at the end of each iteration and the loop continues until `tc` becomes 0, the final output will be "Alice" printed `tc` times.
