Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `tc` is an input integer within the range \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\).
3. **Check if the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `tc > 0` must be true.

Given that `tc` is already within the range \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `tc`.

Since no other variables are mentioned in the loop head, and the condition `tc > 0` is already satisfied based on the given range, no additional adjustments are required.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`tc` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4**
