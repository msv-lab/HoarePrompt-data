Output State: **`tc` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ tc ≤ 10^4. All other variables retain their initial states.**

Explanation: The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `tc` is not known initially, but it is guaranteed to be within the specified range. The initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile remain unchanged.
