Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) integers representing the number of stones in each of n piles (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operations inside the function.
