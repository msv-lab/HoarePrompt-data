You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the initial number of stones in each pile. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        arr = sorted(list(set([int(x) for x in input().split(' ')])), reverse=True) + [
            0]
        
        dp = True
        
        n = len(arr) - 1
        
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            dp = arr[i] - (arr[i + 1] if i < n else 0) > 1 or not dp
        
        print('Alice' if dp else 'Alice')
        
        tc -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of strings either "Alice" or "Bob" printed based on the conditions inside the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop processes `tc` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, then a list of integers, sorts the unique elements in descending order, appends a zero, and checks a condition using dynamic programming (DP) to determine if "Alice" or "Bob" should be printed. After processing all `tc` test cases, the output will consist of "Alice" or "Bob" printed for each test case, depending on whether the condition `dp` was met or not.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) integers representing the number of stones in each of n piles (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
