You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `num_tests` lines, each containing an integer representing the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case (indicated by the value of `num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (`nums`). It then calculates the value of `start_year` based on the formula provided in the loop body. After calculating `start_year` for each test case, it prints the result. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, there will be `num_tests` printed results, one for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a sequence of positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given values of `t` and the sequence `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
