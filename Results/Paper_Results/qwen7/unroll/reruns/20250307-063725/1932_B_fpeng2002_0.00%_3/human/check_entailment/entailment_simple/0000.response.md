Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the nth sign of the apocalypse will occur based on the given periodicities. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`nums`).
   - It initializes `start_year` to 0, which will be updated to the next year where all signs can occur sequentially.
   - It iterates through the list of periodicities and updates `start_year` using the formula `(start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. This ensures that `start_year` is always a multiple of the current periodicity and accounts for the sequential occurrence of signs.
3. **Output**: The program correctly prints the `start_year` for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the annotated program accurately calculates the required year for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
