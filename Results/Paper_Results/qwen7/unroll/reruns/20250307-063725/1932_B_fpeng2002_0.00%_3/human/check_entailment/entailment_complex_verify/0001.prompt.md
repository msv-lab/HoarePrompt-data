You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        start_year = 0
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        
        start_year = 0
        
        for x in range(0, len(nums)):
            start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]
        
        print(start_year)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of `num_tests` lines, each containing an integer representing the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.
    #
    #Explanation: For each test case (indicated by the value of `num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (`nums`). It then calculates the value of `start_year` based on the formula provided in the loop body. After calculating `start_year` for each test case, it prints the result. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, there will be `num_tests` printed results, one for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a sequence of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `start_year` based on the formula `((start_year + 1) // a[x] + 1) * a[x]`, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0. After processing all test cases, it outputs `num_tests` lines, each containing the calculated `start_year` for each respective test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to calculate the year when all `n` signs will occur sequentially.
   - For each sign, the tribe waits until the next occurrence after the previous sign has occurred.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a_i`).
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is incorrect because the first sign should start at year 0 or 1 depending on the context. However, the logic in the loop should handle this correctly.
   - The loop iterates over each periodicity `nums[x]` and updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign after the last sign has occurred.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The update logic `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is correct. This ensures that `start_year` is always a multiple of `nums[x]` and accounts for the fact that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - This logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - It correctly calculates the year for each test case.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.
