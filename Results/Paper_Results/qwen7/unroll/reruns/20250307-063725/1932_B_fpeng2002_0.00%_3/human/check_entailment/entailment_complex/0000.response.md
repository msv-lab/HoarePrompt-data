Reasoning:
The provided program logic aims to calculate the year when all \( n \) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially. The approach taken in the program is to initialize `start_year` to 0 and iteratively update it using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` for each sign's periodicity. This formula essentially finds the smallest year greater than or equal to `start_year + 1` that is a multiple of `nums[x]`.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation of the formula. Specifically, the formula should be `start_year = (start_year + nums[x] - 1) // nums[x] * nums[x]` instead of `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`. The current formula does not correctly handle the sequential nature of the signs' occurrences.

To fix this, we need to ensure that `start_year` is updated to the next multiple of `nums[x]` after the previous `start_year` plus one. The corrected formula ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

Given the explanation in the annotated program and the provided example, the program logic needs to be adjusted to correctly calculate the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

Correctness: **False**
