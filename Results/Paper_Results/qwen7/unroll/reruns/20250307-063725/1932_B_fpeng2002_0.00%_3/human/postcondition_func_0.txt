The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `n` and a sequence of `n` positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `start_year` based on the formula `((start_year + 1) // a[x] + 1) * a[x]`, starting with `start_year` initialized to 0. After processing all test cases, it outputs `num_tests` lines, each containing the calculated `start_year` for each respective test case.
