### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to calculate the year when all `n` signs will occur sequentially.
   - For each sign, the tribe waits until the next occurrence after the previous sign has occurred.

2. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It reads the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a_i`).
   - The variable `start_year` is initialized to 0, which is incorrect because the first sign should start at year 0 or 1 depending on the context. However, the logic in the loop should handle this correctly.
   - The loop iterates over each periodicity `nums[x]` and updates `start_year` to the next occurrence of the current sign after the last sign has occurred.

3. **Logic Verification:**
   - The update logic `start_year = ((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]` is correct. This ensures that `start_year` is always a multiple of `nums[x]` and accounts for the fact that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
   - This logic correctly handles the sequential occurrence of signs.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly by using a loop.
   - It correctly calculates the year for each test case.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The program logic is sound and correctly implements the required functionality.
