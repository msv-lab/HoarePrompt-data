State: **`num_tests` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop condition is `num_tests > 0`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.
3. Given that `num_tests` is an input integer, we need to ensure that it meets the condition specified by the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_tests` must be greater than 0.
