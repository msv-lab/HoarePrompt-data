Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `start_year` computed for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case (determined by the value of `num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `nums`. It then calculates `start_year` based on the formula provided in the loop body. The final value of `start_year` for each test case is printed. After processing all test cases, the output state consists of these calculated `start_year` values for each test case in a list.
