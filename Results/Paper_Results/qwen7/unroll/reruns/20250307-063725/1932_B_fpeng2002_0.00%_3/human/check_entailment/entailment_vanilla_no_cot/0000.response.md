Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the way the `start_year` is being updated is incorrect. Here's why:

- The program tries to update `start_year` using the formula `((start_year + 1) // nums[x] + 1) * nums[x]`, but this does not correctly find the next multiple of `nums[x]` that is strictly greater than `start_year`.

To fix this, we need to use a different approach to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the sequence of numbers, as the year when all signs will occur is essentially the LCM of their periodicities. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def func():
    num_tests = int(input())
    while num_tests > 0:
        num_tests -= 1
        n = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
        current_lcm = nums[0]
        for x in nums[1:]:
            current_lcm = lcm(current_lcm, x)
        print(current_lcm)

func()
```

This corrected program uses the `gcd` function to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, ensuring that the tribe waits for the next occurrence of the signs in the correct order.
