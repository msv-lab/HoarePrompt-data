Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases (`num_tests`) from the input. This changes the value of `num_tests` to an integer input, while the other variables remain unchanged according to their initial state.
