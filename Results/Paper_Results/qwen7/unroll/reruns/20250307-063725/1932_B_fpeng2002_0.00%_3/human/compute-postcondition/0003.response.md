Output State: The output state will consist of `num_tests` lines, each containing an integer representing the value of `start_year` calculated for each test case.

Explanation: For each test case (indicated by the value of `num_tests`), the code reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers (`nums`). It then calculates the value of `start_year` based on the formula provided in the loop body. After calculating `start_year` for each test case, it prints the result. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, there will be `num_tests` printed results, one for each test case.
