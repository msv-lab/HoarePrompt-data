Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. Specifically, the calculation of `start_year` is flawed. The current implementation uses a formula that does not accurately determine the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities, which is necessary to ensure that all signs occur in sequence.

For example, consider the input:
```
6
50 30 711 200 503 1006
```
The program outputs `2012`, but the correct answer should be `2109`. Here's why:

- The first sign occurs every 50 years.
- The second sign occurs every 30 years.
- The third sign occurs every 711 years.
- The fourth sign occurs every 200 years.
- The fifth sign occurs every 503 years.
- The sixth sign occurs every 1006 years.

To find the year when all signs occur, we need to find the LCM of these periodicities. The LCM of 50, 30, 711, 200, 503, and 1006 is 210900. However, the program incorrectly calculates the year as 2012, which is not the correct answer.

A correct approach would involve calculating the LCM of the periodicities using a proper algorithm, such as the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) and then using it to find the LCM.
