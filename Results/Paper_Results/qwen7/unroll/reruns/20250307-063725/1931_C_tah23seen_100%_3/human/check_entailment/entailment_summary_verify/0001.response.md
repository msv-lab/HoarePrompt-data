### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled well.

2. **Array Processing**: The program calls a function `func_1(arr)` to process each array and calculate the minimum cost. However, the function `func_1(arr)` is incomplete and does not implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

3. **Function `func_1(arr)` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It then uses two while loops to skip over consecutive identical elements at the beginning and end of the array.
   - Finally, it checks if the first and last elements are the same and returns the maximum of `j - i - 1` or 0. If they are different, it returns the maximum of the minimum cost to change the entire array to the first element or the last element.

4. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation where all elements between indices `i` and `j` are set to a value `x`.
   - The cost of such an operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

5. **Missing Logic**:
   - The current implementation of `func_1(arr)` does not account for the actual cost calculation based on the problem statement.
   - It only considers the cost of changing the entire array to either the first or last element, which is not the complete solution.

6. **Correct Solution**:
   - The solution should involve iterating through the array to find the minimum cost of making all elements equal by considering all possible operations.
   - The function should keep track of the minimum cost by comparing the cost of setting all elements to the current element with the previously calculated minimum cost.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The function `func_1(arr)` does not properly handle the logic required to determine the minimum cost based on the problem constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
