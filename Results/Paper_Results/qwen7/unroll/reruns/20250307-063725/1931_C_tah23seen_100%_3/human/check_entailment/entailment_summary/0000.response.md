Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the boundaries within which the array needs to be made uniform through a single operation. However, there are some issues with the logic used in the `func_1` function:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Boundaries**: The function tries to find the first and last differing elements to calculate the cost of making the array uniform. But the current implementation does not correctly identify these boundaries.
2. **Logic Flaw**: The function assumes that the array can be made uniform by changing a segment starting from the first differing element to the last differing element. This approach might not always yield the optimal solution.

Let's analyze the provided execution summary and the actual requirements:

- The goal is to minimize the cost of making all elements equal using at most one operation.
- The cost of the operation is the length of the segment being changed.
- The optimal strategy involves finding the minimum cost of changing the array to a single value.

Given the execution summary, the function seems to be trying to find the minimum cost by considering the boundary conditions but fails to correctly implement the logic.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    min_cost = float('inf')
    value_counts = {}
    
    # Count occurrences of each value
    for value in arr:
        if value in value_counts:
            value_counts[value] += 1
        else:
            value_counts[value] = 1
    
    # Find the minimum cost to make all elements equal to the most frequent value
    for value in value_counts:
        cost = n - value_counts[value]
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost
```

This function correctly identifies the most frequent value and calculates the cost of making all elements equal to that value.

Given the above analysis, the original function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
