Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case by reading the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the array to find the first pair of unequal elements (`i`) and the last pair of unequal elements (`j`).
   - The logic to set `i` and `j` is correct. `i` is set to the index where the first pair of unequal elements is found, and `j` is set to the index of the last element that is different from the next one.
   - The condition `if (arr[0] == arr[-1])` checks if the first and last elements of the array are the same. If they are, it calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This is correct because if all elements are the same, no operation is needed, and if there is a segment that needs to be changed, the cost is the length of that segment minus one.
   - If the first and last elements are not the same, the function returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This is also correct because it calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal by either changing the prefix or the suffix of the array.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the array might already be uniform (all elements are the same) or where the first and last elements are different but the rest are the same.

Given the analysis above, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.

Correctness: **True**
