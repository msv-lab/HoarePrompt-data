Output State: **i is the index where the first pair of unequal elements is found or len(arr) - 1 if all elements are equal.**

Explanation: The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`. Once it finds a pair of elements that are not equal or when `i` reaches `len(arr) - 1`, the loop stops. Therefore, `i` will be at the index of the first pair of unequal elements, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are equal.
