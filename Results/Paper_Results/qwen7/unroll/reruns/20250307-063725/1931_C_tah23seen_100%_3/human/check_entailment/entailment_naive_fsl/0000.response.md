Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not handle cases where the array has multiple distinct values that need to be made equal through the allowed operations.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```

Expected Output:
```
4
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This is incorrect because the minimum cost to make all elements equal would be to change the entire array to either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, which would require at least 4 operations (changing all elements to the most frequent element).

The logic in `func_1` does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal, especially when there are multiple distinct values. It only checks if the first and last elements are the same and then calculates the cost based on that, which is insufficient for determining the minimum cost in all cases.
