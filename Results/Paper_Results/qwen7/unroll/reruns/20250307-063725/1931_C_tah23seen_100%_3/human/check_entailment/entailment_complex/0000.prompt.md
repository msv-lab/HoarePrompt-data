Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index where the first pair of unequal elements is found or len(arr) - 1 if all elements are equal.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: j is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns the maximum value between (j - i - 1) and 0, where `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same, and `i` is the index of the first element of the array `arr` which is also its last element since `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.
    #State: j is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same. The first element of `arr` is not equal to the last element of `arr`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - j - 1) and (j), where n is the length of the array `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the maximum value between two possible calculations. In the first case, it calculates the maximum value between (j - i - 1) and 0, where `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same, and `i` is the index of the first element of the array `arr` which is also its last element since `arr[0] == arr[-1]`. In the second case, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - j - 1) and (j), where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.
