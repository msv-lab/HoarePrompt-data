Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns the maximum value between (j - i - 1) and 0, where `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same, and `i` is the index of the first element of the array `arr` which is also its last element since `arr[0] == arr[-1]`. It also returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - j - 1) and (j), where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.**
