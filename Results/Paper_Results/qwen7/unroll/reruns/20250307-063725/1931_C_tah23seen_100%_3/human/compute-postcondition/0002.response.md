Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of the list `arr` - 1**

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value of `len(arr) - 1`. The initial value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The length of the list `arr` is represented by `n`, but since `n` is not used in the code snippet, we directly use `len(arr)` to represent the updated value of `j`.
