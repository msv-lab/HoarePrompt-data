Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between (j - i - 1) and 0, where `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same, and `i` is the index of the first element of the array `arr` which is also its last element since `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.**

Given that `i` is the index of the first (and last) element of the array `arr`, and `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same, the expression `max(j - i - 1, 0)` calculates the length of the longest subarray starting from `i` where all elements are the same. If `j` is 0 (meaning all elements are the same), then `j - i - 1` would be -1, but `max(-1, 0)` returns 0. Therefore, the program effectively returns the length of the longest subarray of identical elements starting from the first element.
