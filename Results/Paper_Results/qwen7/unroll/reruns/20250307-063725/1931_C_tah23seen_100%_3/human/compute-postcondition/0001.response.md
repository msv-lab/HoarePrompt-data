Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `arr`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(arr)` calculates the length of the list `arr` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `i` remains unchanged and is still 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and the unchanged value of `i`.
