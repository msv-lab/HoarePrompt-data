Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the array to find the first index `i` where the elements are unequal and the last index `j` where the elements are unequal.
   - The logic for setting `i` and `j` is correct. It ensures that `i` points to the first position where the sequence breaks and `j` points to the last position where the sequence breaks.
   - The function then checks if the first and last elements of the array are the same. If they are, it calculates the cost as `max(j - i - 1, 0)`.
   - If the first and last elements are not the same, it calculates the cost as `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`.

3. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation logic is correct. It considers the minimum cost to make all elements equal by either starting from the beginning or the end of the array.
   - The formula `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)` ensures that the cost is always non-negative and accounts for the smallest segment of the array that needs to be changed.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the calculated cost, which is printed in the main program.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation.

Correctness: **True**
