The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.

The function returns the maximum value between two cases:
- Case_1: The maximum value between (j - i - 1) and 0, where `j` is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same, and `i` is the index of the first element of the array `arr` which is also its last element since `arr[0] == arr[-1]`.
- Case_2: The maximum value between the minimum of (n - j - 1) and (j), where `n` is the length of the array `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the maximum value calculated based on the specified conditions involving indices and element comparisons within the list.
