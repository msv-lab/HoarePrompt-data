Output State: **`i` is 0, arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element in the list is an integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code initializes the variable `i` to 0. No changes are made to the list `arr`, so its state remains the same as the initial state.
