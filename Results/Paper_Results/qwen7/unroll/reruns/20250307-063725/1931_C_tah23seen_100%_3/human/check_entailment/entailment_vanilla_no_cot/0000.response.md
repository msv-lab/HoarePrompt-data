Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The function `func_1` does not accurately calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The logic in the function does not properly account for the cost of the operation, which is dependent on the length of the segment being modified. The current implementation only checks for adjacent equal elements and does not consider the optimal position for the operation to minimize the cost.
