Output State: **j is the index of the last element that is different from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same.**

Explanation: The loop decrements `j` while the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means it continues until it finds an element that is different from its predecessor or until `j` becomes 0 (which happens when it reaches the start of the array). Thus, `j` will be the index of the last element that is different from the one before it, or 0 if all elements are the same.
