Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with a predefined tree structure consisting of n vertices and n-1 edges, where 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5. It roots the tree and returns nothing (None).**

This means the function `func_5` operates on a pre-defined tree structure that has been initialized with `n` vertices and `n-1` edges. The function roots the tree at a vertex `k` (where `1 ≤ k < n`) and does not return any value, hence returning `None`.
