Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the maximum number \( x \) such that removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree results in each remaining connected component having at least \( x \) vertices.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for a given starting vertex. However, the provided implementation seems incomplete and does not fully align with the problem requirements. It should be used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size for each subtree.
   - **func_2**: This function is a recursive helper function for calculating the number of good components and the remaining size for a subtree rooted at a given vertex. It correctly counts good components and accumulates the remaining size.
   - **func_3**: This function checks if the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the number of good components equals \( k \) and the remaining size is at least \( x \). It uses the results from `func_1`.
   - **func_4**: This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \) that satisfies the conditions. It uses `func_3` to check the validity of the midpoint in the binary search.
   - **func_5**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, roots it, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the core logic appears to be correctly implemented. The binary search in `func_4` ensures that the maximum \( x \) is found efficiently. The recursive traversal in `func_2` and the initial calculation in `func_1` seem to be correctly designed to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
