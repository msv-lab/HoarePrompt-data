### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly initializes a tree structure using the `Tree` class.
   - It reads the number of vertices `n` and the number of edges to remove `k` from the input.
   - It then reads the edges and adds them to the tree.

2. **Tree Rooting**:
   - The tree is rooted using a non-recursive approach (`root_tree_non_recursive`), which ensures that the tree structure is properly set up with parent-child relationships.

3. **Finding Good Components**:
   - The program uses two functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component.
   - Both functions traverse the tree and update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes based on the conditions specified in the problem statement.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Size**:
   - The `func_4` function performs a binary search to find the maximum size `x` such that it is possible to remove exactly `k` edges and ensure that each remaining connected component has at least `x` vertices.
   - The function `func_3` checks if a given `x` is feasible by calling `func_1` and verifying the conditions.

5. **Output**:
   - The final result is printed, which is the maximum size `x` found by the binary search.

### Analysis of Correctness:

- **Tree Initialization and Rooting**: The tree is correctly initialized and rooted, ensuring that the structure is valid.
- **Component Calculation**: The functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component.
- **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search in `func_4` is implemented correctly, and it converges to the correct maximum size `x`.

Given that all parts of the program are logically sound and correctly implement the required functionality, the program should produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
