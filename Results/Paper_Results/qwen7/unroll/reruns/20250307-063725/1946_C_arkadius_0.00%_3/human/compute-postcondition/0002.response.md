State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `k` must be an integer, `i` must be 1, `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree initialized with `n` nodes**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop runs from `1` to `n-1`, so `n` must be greater than `0` for the loop to execute at least once.
2. The variable `i` is initialized to `1` in the loop header (`range(1, n)`), so `i` must be `1` at the start of the loop.
3. The variable `k` is not used directly in the loop header but could be used within the loop body. However, since no specific use of `k` is mentioned in the loop header, we do not need to adjust its state here.
4. The object `tree` is already initialized with `n` nodes, so no adjustment is needed for `tree`.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` (to ensure the loop can execute) and `i` (to match the initialization in the loop header).
