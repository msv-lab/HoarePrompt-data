Output State: `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `k` is an integer value entered by the user, `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree. After the loop executes all iterations, `tree` contains `n` nodes with edges added based on user inputs, where each iteration adds an edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`.
