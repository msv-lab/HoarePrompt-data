You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search is performed between `beg = 1` and `end = n`. This is because the smallest possible value of \( x \) is 1 (each component must have at least one vertex), and the largest possible value of \( x \) is \( n \) (if we only remove edges to separate all vertices into individual components).

3. **Checking Feasibility with `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to achieve at least `k` good components (components with at least `x` vertices) by using `func_1`.
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex.
   - `func_2` is a helper function used within `func_1` to recursively traverse the tree and calculate the required values.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - For each midpoint `mid`, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to have at least `k` good components where each component has at least `mid` vertices.
   - If `func_3` returns `True`, it means we can achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the lower bound `beg` up to `mid`.
   - If `func_3` returns `False`, it means we cannot achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the upper bound `end` down to `mid - 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the search range is reduced to a single value (`beg == end`), which correctly identifies the maximum feasible value of \( x \).

6. **Tree Representation and Operations:**
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and access to vertex information.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to set the root of the tree, but its implementation details are not provided here.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \) using binary search and the necessary helper functions. The code structure and logic align with the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
