### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution uses binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search is performed between `beg = 1` and `end = n`. This is because the smallest possible value of \( x \) is 1 (each component must have at least one vertex), and the largest possible value of \( x \) is \( n \) (if we only remove edges to separate all vertices into individual components).

3. **Checking Feasibility with `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to achieve at least `k` good components (components with at least `x` vertices) by using `func_1`.
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex.
   - `func_2` is a helper function used within `func_1` to recursively traverse the tree and calculate the required values.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - For each midpoint `mid`, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to have at least `k` good components where each component has at least `mid` vertices.
   - If `func_3` returns `True`, it means we can achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the lower bound `beg` up to `mid`.
   - If `func_3` returns `False`, it means we cannot achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the upper bound `end` down to `mid - 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the search range is reduced to a single value (`beg == end`), which correctly identifies the maximum feasible value of \( x \).

6. **Tree Representation and Operations:**
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and access to vertex information.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to set the root of the tree, but its implementation details are not provided here.

### Analysis of Functions:

- **`func_1(tree, s, x)`**: This function performs a post-order traversal of the tree to count the number of good components and update the remaining size for each vertex. The logic seems correct, but it might be overly complex due to the use of `postorder` flag.
- **`func_2(tree, v, x)`**: This function is a helper function for `func_1` and recursively calculates the number of good components and remaining size for a subtree. The logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
- **`func_3(tree, n, k, x)`**: This function checks if it's possible to have at least `k` good components with each component having at least `x` vertices. The logic is correct and uses `func_1` to perform the necessary calculations.
- **`func_4(tree, n, k)`**: This function performs the binary search to find the maximum feasible value of \( x \). The logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.
- **`func_5()`**: This function reads input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result. The logic is correct and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Annotations Validation:

- **`func_1`**: The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the purpose of the function.
- **`func_2`**: The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the purpose of the function.
- **`func_3`**: The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the purpose of the function.
- **`func_4`**: The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the purpose of the function.
- **`func_5`**: The annotations correctly describe the state transitions and the purpose of the function.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \) using binary search and the necessary helper functions. The code structure and logic align with the problem requirements.
