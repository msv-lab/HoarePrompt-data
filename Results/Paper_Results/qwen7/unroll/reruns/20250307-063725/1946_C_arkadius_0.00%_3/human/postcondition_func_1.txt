The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), a vertex \(v\) in the tree, and an integer \(x\) representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing \(k\) edges. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex \(v\), counting the number of good components (where the size of the component is at least \(x\)) and accumulating the sizes of the remaining components. Finally, it returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of good components, and `remaining_size`, which is the total size of the remaining components that do not meet the size requirement.
