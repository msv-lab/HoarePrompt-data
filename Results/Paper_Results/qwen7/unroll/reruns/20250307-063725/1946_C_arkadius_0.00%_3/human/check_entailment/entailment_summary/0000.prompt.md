Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

    return (tree.vertices[s].good_components, tree.vertices[s].remaining_size)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function processes a tree structure to determine the number of good components and the remaining size for a given starting vertex `s`. A good component is defined as a connected component with a remaining size greater than or equal to `x`. The function updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex in the tree, ultimately returning these values for the starting vertex `s`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(tree: Tree, v: int, x: int) -> (int, int):
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1

        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
    return (good_components, remaining_size)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), a vertex \(v\) in the tree, and an integer \(x\) representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing \(k\) edges. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex \(v\), counting the number of good components (where the size of the component is at least \(x\)) and accumulating the sizes of the remaining components. Finally, it returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of good components, and `remaining_size`, which is the total size of the remaining components that do not meet the size requirement.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int, x: int) -> bool:
    (good_components, remaining_size) = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if good_components > k:
        return True
    if good_components == k and remaining_size >= x:
        return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, it also returns `True`. In all other cases, it returns `False`.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(tree: Tree, n: int, k: int) -> int:
    beg = 1
    end = n

        mid = (beg + end + 1) // 2
        if func_3(tree, n, k, mid):
            beg = mid
        else:
            end = mid - 1
    return beg
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a tree instance, an integer n, and an integer k. It performs a binary search to find the value of `beg` (which becomes equal to `end`) that satisfies the condition `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` for the last time before the loop terminates. The function returns this value.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    [n, k] = map(int, input().split())
    tree = Tree(n)
    for i in range(1, n):
        [u, v] = map(int, input().split())
        tree.add_edge(u - 1, v - 1)
    tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)
    print(func_4(tree, n, k))
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads the number of vertices \( n \) and a value \( k \) from user input, constructs a tree structure with \( n \) vertices and \( n-1 \) edges based on further user inputs, roots the tree using a non-recursive method, and then calls another function `func_4` with the tree, \( n \), and \( k \) as arguments. The final output is the result returned by `func_4`.
