### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.

#### Function Analysis:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function seems to be intended to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component after removing edges.
   - It uses a post-order traversal to process each node and its children.
   - However, the logic inside the function is flawed. For example, it incorrectly updates the `remaining_size` and `good_components` without properly handling the removal of edges.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is a recursive helper function for `func_1`.
   - It also has issues similar to `func_1` in terms of how it handles the remaining size and good components.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function checks if the conditions for \( x \) are met by calling `func_1`.
   - If the number of good components is greater than \( k \) or if the remaining size of the root component is at least \( x \) when the number of good components equals \( k \), it returns `True`.
   - Otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Function 4 (`func_4`)**:
   - This function performs a binary search to find the maximum \( x \).
   - It calls `func_3` with different values of \( x \) until it finds the correct \( x \).

5. **Function 5 (`func_5`)**:
   - This function reads input, constructs the tree, roots the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result.

#### Detailed Issues:
- **Function 1 and Function 2**: These functions do not correctly simulate the removal of edges. They simply traverse the tree and update some variables without actually removing any edges.
- **Function 3**: This function assumes that `func_1` correctly calculates the number of good components and remaining size, which is not true.
- **Function 4**: This function performs a binary search, but since `func_3` is flawed, the binary search may not converge to the correct answer.

#### Example Walkthrough:
Consider the input:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
- Expected Output: `2`
- Actual Output: Incorrect (due to flawed logic in `func_1` and `func_2`)

Given these issues, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed logic in the functions responsible for calculating the number of good components and the remaining size after edge removal.
