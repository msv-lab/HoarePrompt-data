Functionality: **The function reads the number of vertices \( n \) and a value \( k \) from user input, constructs a tree structure with \( n \) vertices and \( n-1 \) edges based on further user inputs, roots the tree using a non-recursive method, and then calls another function `func_4` with the tree, \( n \), and \( k \) as arguments. The final output is the result returned by `func_4`.**
