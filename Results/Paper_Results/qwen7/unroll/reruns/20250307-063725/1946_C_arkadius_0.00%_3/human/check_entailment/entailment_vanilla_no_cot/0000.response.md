To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze the logic and implementation of the functions provided. Let's break down the solution step by step:

### Analysis of Functions

1. **`func_1`**: This function seems to be incorrectly implemented. It attempts to traverse the tree and calculate some properties (`good_components` and `remaining_size`) but does not seem to be used correctly in the context of the problem. The function name suggests it might be related to a post-order traversal, but the logic inside does not align with typical post-order traversal behavior.

2. **`func_2`**: This function also appears to be incorrectly named and implemented. It is supposed to recursively calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree. However, it is not clear how this function is being used or how it fits into the overall solution.

3. **`func_3`**: This function checks if it is possible to remove `k` edges such that the remaining components have sizes at least `x`. The logic here is flawed because it uses `func_1`, which is incorrectly implemented.

4. **`func_4`**: This binary search function tries to find the maximum `x` such that it is possible to remove `k` edges and ensure each remaining component has at least `x` vertices. The logic here is correct, but it relies on the correctness of `func_3`.

5. **`func_5`**: This function reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls `func_4` to get the result. The tree construction and input reading logic appear to be correct.

### Correctness Check

Given the analysis above, the key issue lies in the incorrect implementations of `func_1` and `func_2`. These functions do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the overall solution is incorrect.

### Conclusion

Since the core logic of the solution is based on incorrect implementations of `func_1` and `func_2`, the entire program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
