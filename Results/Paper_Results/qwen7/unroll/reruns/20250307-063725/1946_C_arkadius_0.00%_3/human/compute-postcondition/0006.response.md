Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is an integer value entered by the user.
- `k` is an integer value entered by the user.
- `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree.
- The tree is rooted non-recursively with the root node as 0.

The function `func_4(tree, n, k)` is called and its result is printed. However, the definition of `func_4` is not provided. Since no specific implementation details of `func_4` are given, we cannot determine the exact output of the function.

Therefore, the output will depend on the implementation of `func_4`. Given the information, we can only describe it as follows:

Output: **the result of func_4(tree, n, k)**
