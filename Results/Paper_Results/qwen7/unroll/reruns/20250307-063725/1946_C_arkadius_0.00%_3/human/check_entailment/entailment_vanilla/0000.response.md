### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search is performed between `beg = 1` and `end = n`. This is because the smallest possible value of \( x \) is 1 (each component must have at least one vertex), and the largest possible value of \( x \) is \( n \) (if we only remove edges to separate all vertices into individual components).

3. **Checking Feasibility with `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to achieve at least `k` good components (components with at least `x` vertices) by using `func_1`.
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex.
   - `func_2` is a helper function used within `func_1` to recursively traverse the tree and calculate the required values.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - For each midpoint `mid`, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to have at least `k` good components where each component has at least `mid` vertices.
   - If `func_3` returns `True`, it means we can achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the lower bound `beg` up to `mid`.
   - If `func_3` returns `False`, it means we cannot achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the upper bound `end` down to `mid - 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the search range is reduced to a single value (`beg == end`), which correctly identifies the maximum feasible value of \( x \).

6. **Tree Representation and Operations:**
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and access to vertex information.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to set the root of the tree, but its implementation details are not provided here.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum \( x \) using binary search and the necessary helper functions. The code structure and logic align with the problem requirements.
