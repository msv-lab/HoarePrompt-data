### Reasoning:

1. **Tree Representation and Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the input to build a tree structure.
   - `func_5` reads the number of vertices `n` and edges to remove `k`, then constructs the tree using the given edges.

2. **Finding Good Components**:
   - `func_1` attempts to find the number of good components (components with size at least `x`) after removing edges.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` seems flawed because it uses a post-order traversal but incorrectly accumulates sizes and counts of good components.

3. **Recursive Component Counting**:
   - `func_2` is intended to count the number of good components and the total remaining size in a subtree.
   - This function is more logically sound but still does not correctly handle the removal of edges.

4. **Validation Function**:
   - `func_3` checks if the current value of `x` is feasible by calling `func_1`.
   - The logic here is also flawed because it does not properly account for the removal of edges.

5. **Binary Search for Maximum `x`**:
   - `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum `x` such that the tree can be split into components of size at least `x` by removing exactly `k` edges.
   - The binary search is implemented correctly, but the functions it relies on (`func_1` and `func_3`) are incorrect.

6. **Tree Class and Rooting**:
   - The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`) seem to be implemented correctly for building and rooting the tree.
   - However, these methods do not directly affect the correctness of the main logic since they are called correctly.

### Conclusion:
The core issue lies in the functions `func_1` and `func_3`, which are responsible for determining the number of good components and checking feasibility. These functions contain logical errors that prevent them from correctly determining the maximum `x`.
