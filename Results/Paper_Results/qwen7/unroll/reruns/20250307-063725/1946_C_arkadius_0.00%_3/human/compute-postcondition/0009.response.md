Functionality: **The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, it also returns `True`. In all other cases, it returns `False`.**
