Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` do not accurately calculate the number of good components and the remaining size after removing edges. The function `func_4` performs a binary search to find the maximum value of `x`, but the calculations within `func_1` and `func_2` are flawed.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
3 1
1 2
1 3
```
The expected output is `2`, because we can remove the edge between vertex 1 and vertex 2, leaving two connected components of sizes 2 and 1. However, the current implementation might not handle this case correctly due to the flawed logic in `func_1` and `func_2`.

To verify, let's walk through the logic:
- `func_1` and `func_2` should traverse the tree and calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of each component.
- `func_3` checks if the conditions for `x` are met.
- `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum `x`.

Given the complexity of the problem, the current implementation might not correctly handle all edge cases, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
