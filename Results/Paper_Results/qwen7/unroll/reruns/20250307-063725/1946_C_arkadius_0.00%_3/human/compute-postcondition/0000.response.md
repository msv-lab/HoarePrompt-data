Output State: **[n, k] are updated to the integer values entered by the user, tree is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `n` and `k`. The `tree` object remains unchanged and still represents a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree. The precondition that `1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5` is still valid.
