Output State: **`n` is an integer value entered by the user, `k` is an integer value entered by the user, `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree, and the tree is rooted non-recursively with the root node as 0.**

The code `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` roots the tree non-recursively with the root node set to 0. The value of -1 for the second parameter is typically used to indicate that no parent node exists for the root node. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, and the tree now has its root node set to 0.
