You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a Tree object representing the tree structure with n vertices, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and x is an integer representing the size of the connected components.
def func_3(tree, n, k, x):
    good_components, remaining_size = func_1(tree, 0, x)
    if (good_components > k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `tree` is a Tree object representing the tree structure with n vertices, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer representing the size of the connected components, `good_components` is the result returned by `func_1`, and `remaining_size` is the result returned by `func_1`. The number of good components is less than or equal to k
    if (good_components == k and remaining_size >= x) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State: `tree` is a Tree object representing the tree structure with n vertices, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, `x` is an integer representing the size of the connected components, `good_components` is the result returned by `func_1`, and `remaining_size` is the result returned by `func_1`. The number of good components is less than or equal to k, and either `good_components` is not equal to k or `remaining_size` is less than x.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`. It returns `True` in two cases and `False` in one case.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns True

Case_2: The program returns True

Case_3: The program returns False


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
