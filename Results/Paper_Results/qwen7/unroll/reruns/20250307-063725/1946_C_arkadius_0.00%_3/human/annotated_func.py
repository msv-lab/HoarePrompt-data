#State of the program right berfore the function call: `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure where each vertex has a `children` list and attributes `good_components` and `remaining_size`. `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex in the tree, and `x` is an integer representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing edges.

    #
    #- If `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will be updated based on the sum of `good_components` from its children vertices `u`. Additionally, if `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `tree.vertices[v].good_components` will increment by 1. Otherwise, `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size` will be incremented by `tree.vertices[u].remaining_size`.
    #
    #- The `postorder` attribute for each vertex will be set to `True`.
    #
    #The `stack` will be empty because all elements will have been popped and processed according to the conditions specified in the loop. Each vertex's `good_components` will reflect the number of good components (components with a remaining size greater than or equal to `x`) in its subtree, considering the contributions from its children. The `remaining_size` attribute will be updated to account for the sizes of all its descendants.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a tree structure to determine the number of good components and the remaining size for a given starting vertex `s`. A good component is defined as a connected component with a remaining size greater than or equal to `x`. The function updates the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes for each vertex in the tree, ultimately returning these values for the starting vertex `s`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree (an instance of a Tree class), a vertex \(v\) in the tree, and an integer \(x\) representing the minimum size of each remaining connected component after removing \(k\) edges. It recursively traverses the tree starting from vertex \(v\), counting the number of good components (where the size of the component is at least \(x\)) and accumulating the sizes of the remaining components. Finally, it returns two values: `good_components`, which is the total count of good components, and `remaining_size`, which is the total size of the remaining components that do not meet the size requirement.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a Tree object `tree`, an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and an integer `x`. It first calls another function `func_1` to get the number of good components and the remaining size. If the number of good components is greater than `k`, it returns `True`. Otherwise, if the number of good components equals `k` and the remaining size is at least `x`, it also returns `True`. In all other cases, it returns `False`.

    return beg
    #The program returns the value of `beg` which is equal to `end` and satisfies the condition `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` for the last time before the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tree instance, an integer n, and an integer k. It performs a binary search to find the value of `beg` (which becomes equal to `end`) that satisfies the condition `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` for the last time before the loop terminates. The function returns this value.

    #State: Output State: `n` is an integer value entered by the user, `k` is an integer value entered by the user, `tree` is an instance of a class representing a tree structure with methods to add edges and root the tree.

    #This is printed: the result of func_4(tree, n, k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the number of vertices \( n \) and a value \( k \) from user input, constructs a tree structure with \( n \) vertices and \( n-1 \) edges based on further user inputs, roots the tree using a non-recursive method, and then calls another function `func_4` with the tree, \( n \), and \( k \) as arguments. The final output is the result returned by `func_4`.
