### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum number \( x \) such that after removing exactly \( k \) edges from a tree, each remaining connected component has at least \( x \) vertices.
   - The solution involves binary search over possible values of \( x \).

2. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - The binary search is performed between `beg = 1` and `end = n`. This is correct because the smallest possible value of \( x \) is 1, and the largest possible value of \( x \) is \( n \).

3. **Checking Feasibility with `func_3`:**
   - `func_3` checks if it's possible to achieve at least `k` good components (components with at least `x` vertices) by using `func_1`.
   - `func_1` uses a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree rooted at a given vertex.
   - `func_2` is a helper function used within `func_1` to recursively traverse the tree and calculate the required values.

4. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - For each midpoint `mid`, `func_3` is called to check if it's possible to have at least `k` good components where each component has at least `mid` vertices.
   - If `func_3` returns `True`, it means we can achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the lower bound `beg` up to `mid`.
   - If `func_3` returns `False`, it means we cannot achieve at least `k` good components with `mid` vertices, so we move the upper bound `end` down to `mid - 1`.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge case where the search range is reduced to a single value (`beg == end`), which correctly identifies the maximum feasible value of \( x \).

6. **Tree Representation and Operations:**
   - The `Tree` class is assumed to be defined elsewhere and provides methods like `add_edge`, `root_tree_non_recursive`, and access to vertex information.
   - The `root_tree_non_recursive` method is used to set the root of the tree, but its implementation details are not provided here.

However, there are some issues with the implementation:

- **Function `func_1` and `func_2`**:
  - These functions use a post-order traversal to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree. However, the logic inside these functions seems to be incorrect. Specifically, the way `good_components` and `remaining_size` are updated does not accurately reflect the desired behavior. For example, `tree.vertices[v].good_components += tree.vertices[u].good_components` and `tree.vertices[v].remaining_size += tree.vertices[u].remaining_size` do not correctly account for the sizes of the subtrees when merging them.

- **Function `func_3`**:
  - This function calls `func_1` to check the feasibility of having at least `k` good components with a given `x`. However, `func_1` itself is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

- **Overall Logic**:
  - The overall logic of the program assumes that `func_1` and `func_2` correctly update the `good_components` and `remaining_size` attributes of the tree nodes. Since these functions are incorrect, the binary search logic will not work as intended.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1` and `func_2`, which lead to incorrect results during the binary search.
