Reasoning:

1. **Tree Construction**: The program correctly constructs a tree from the input. The `Tree` class and its methods (`add_edge` and `root_tree_non_recursive`) ensure that the tree is built accurately based on the input edges.

2. **Binary Search for Maximum Size**: The `func_4` function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum size \( x \) such that it is possible to remove exactly \( k \) edges and have each remaining connected component with at least \( x \) vertices. This is done by calling `func_3` with different mid-values in the binary search.

3. **Checking Good Components and Remaining Size**: The `func_3` function checks if the number of good components (components with at least \( x \) vertices) is sufficient to cover \( k \) edge removals. It also ensures that the remaining size of the components meets the requirement.

4. **Recursive Traversal for Component Analysis**: The `func_1` and `func_2` functions perform recursive traversal to analyze the tree and update the necessary attributes (`good_components` and `remaining_size`). These functions correctly propagate the information up the tree structure.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**: The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately. The binary search ensures that the solution is found within the required range, and the tree construction and analysis functions handle the tree structure correctly.

Given that all functions work together to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
