### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints include:
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to some integer `x`.
   - `k` must be less than or equal to some integer `x`.
   - `k` must be not equal to some integer `x`.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `start`: The minimum value `k` can take.
   - `end`: The maximum value `k` can take.
   - `num`: A list of values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` (a large value).
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), update `start` to `max(start, x)`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), update `end` to `min(end, x)`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), add `x` to the list `num`.
   - Calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - If `start > end`, return `0` because no `k` can satisfy both constraints.
     - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, where `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that lie within `[start, end]`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions and do not directly contribute to solving the problem. They are likely placeholders or may have been intended for different purposes but are not used in the final solution.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values.
   - It initializes `start` and `end` appropriately.
   - It processes each constraint to update `start` and `end` and collects values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It calculates the number of valid `k` values correctly.

6. **Validation Using Function Summary**:
   - The function summary accurately describes the behavior of `func_7`. It correctly outlines the process of updating `start` and `end` and counting the number of invalid values within the range `[start, end]`.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly solves the problem as described. The function `func_7` accurately implements the required logic without any logical errors.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate.
