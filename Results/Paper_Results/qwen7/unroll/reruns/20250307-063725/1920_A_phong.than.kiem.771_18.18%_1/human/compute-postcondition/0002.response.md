Output State: **`n` is an input integer, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3}, v is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ 10^9, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is a list of integers, and count_num is an integer initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The line `end = 1000000000.0` does not affect any other variables and only updates the value of `end` to `1000000000.0`, which is already its initial value. Therefore, all other variables remain unchanged.
