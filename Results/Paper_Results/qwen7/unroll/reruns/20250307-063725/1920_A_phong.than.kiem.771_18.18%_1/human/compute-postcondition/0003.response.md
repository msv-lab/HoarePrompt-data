Output State: **`n` is an input integer, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3}, v is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ v â‰¤ 10^9, start is -1, end is 1000000000.0, num is an empty list, and count_num is an integer initialized to 0.**

The code initializes `num` as an empty list, which changes the state of the `num` variable. All other variables retain their initial states.
