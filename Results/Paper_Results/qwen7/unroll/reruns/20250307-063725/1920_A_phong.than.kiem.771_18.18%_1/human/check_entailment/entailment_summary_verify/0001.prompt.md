You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of inputs to determine the number of values within a specified range. It first collects `n` pairs of integers `t` and `v`. For each pair, if `t` is 1, it updates the minimum value (`start`). If `t` is 2, it updates the maximum value (`end`). If `t` is 3, it adds `v` to the list `num`. After processing all inputs, it counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if this value is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of integers `k` that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints include:
   - `k` must be greater than or equal to some integer `x`.
   - `k` must be less than or equal to some integer `x`.
   - `k` must be not equal to some integer `x`.

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `start`: The minimum value `k` can take.
   - `end`: The maximum value `k` can take.
   - `num`: A list of values that `k` must not be equal to.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` (a large value).
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), update `start` to `max(start, x)`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), update `end` to `min(end, x)`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), add `x` to the list `num`.
   - Calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - If `start > end`, return `0` because no `k` can satisfy both constraints.
     - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid `k` values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, where `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that lie within `[start, end]`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions and do not directly contribute to solving the problem. They are likely placeholders or may have been intended for different purposes but are not used in the final solution.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid `k` values.
   - It initializes `start` and `end` appropriately.
   - It processes each constraint to update `start` and `end` and collects values that `k` must not be equal to.
   - It calculates the number of valid `k` values correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly solves the problem as described. The function `func_7` accurately implements the required logic without any logical errors.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
