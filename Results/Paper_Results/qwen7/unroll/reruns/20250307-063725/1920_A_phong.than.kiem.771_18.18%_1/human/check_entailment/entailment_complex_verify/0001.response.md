### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy all given constraints. Constraints include:
   - \( k \) must be greater than or equal to some integer \( x \).
   - \( k \) must be less than or equal to some integer \( x \).
   - \( k \) must be not equal to some integer \( x \).

2. **Key Variables**:
   - `start`: The minimum value \( k \) can take.
   - `end`: The maximum value \( k \) can take.
   - `num`: A list of values that \( k \) must not be equal to.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize `start` to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0` (a large value).
   - For each constraint:
     - If the constraint is of type 1 (`k >= x`), update `start` to `max(start, x)`.
     - If the constraint is of type 2 (`k <= x`), update `end` to `min(end, x)`.
     - If the constraint is of type 3 (`k != x`), add `x` to the list `num`.
   - Calculate the number of valid \( k \) values:
     - If `start > end`, return `0` because no \( k \) can satisfy both constraints.
     - Otherwise, calculate the number of valid \( k \) values as `end - start + 1 - count_num`, where `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that lie within `[start, end]`.

4. **Function Analysis**:
   - The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions and do not directly contribute to solving the problem. They are likely placeholders or may have been intended for different purposes but are not used in the final solution.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The function `func_7` correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid \( k \) values.
   - It initializes `start` and `end` appropriately.
   - It processes each constraint to update `start` and `end` and collects values that \( k \) must not be equal to.
   - It calculates the number of valid \( k \) values correctly.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the implementation of `func_7`, there is a potential issue with the way the constraints are handled. Specifically, the function `func_7` does not properly handle the constraints in a way that ensures the constraints are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initialization**:
  - `start` is initialized to `-1` and `end` to `1000000000.0`. This is appropriate for ensuring that any valid \( k \) falls within the range initially.

- **Processing Constraints**:
  - For each constraint, `start` and `end` are updated correctly based on the type of constraint:
    - Type 1 (`k >= x`): Update `start` to `max(start, x)`.
    - Type 2 (`k <= x`): Update `end` to `min(end, x)`.
    - Type 3 (`k != x`): Add `x` to the list `num`.

- **Counting Valid Values**:
  - The function correctly counts the number of elements in `num` that lie within `[start, end]` and subtracts this count from the total range length `end - start + 1`.

### Potential Issue:
- The function `func_7` does not explicitly ensure that the constraints are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. This means that if there are overlapping constraints or if the constraints are not properly handled, the function might not return the correct number of valid \( k \) values.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the following constraints:
```
1 3
2 5
3 4
```
- `start` is updated to `max(-1, 3) = 3`.
- `end` is updated to `min(1000000000.0, 5) = 5`.
- `num` contains `[4]`.

The valid range is `[3, 5]`, and the only value in `num` that lies within this range is `4`. Therefore, the number of valid \( k \) values should be `5 - 3 + 1 - 1 = 2`. However, the function returns `2`, which is correct in this case.

However, consider another set of constraints:
```
1 3
2 5
3 3
```
- `start` is updated to `max(-1, 3) = 3`.
- `end` is updated to `min(1000000000.0, 5) = 5`.
- `num` contains `[3]`.

The valid range is `[3, 5]`, and the value `3` in `num` lies within this range. Therefore, the number of valid \( k \) values should be `5 - 3 + 1 - 1 = 2`. However, the function returns `2`, which is correct in this case.

### Conclusion:
While the function `func_7` appears to handle the constraints correctly in most cases, there is a potential issue with the way the constraints are processed. The function does not explicitly ensure that the constraints are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive, which could lead to incorrect results in certain edge cases.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
