#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value indicating whether to return an integer input or 1. If isOne is False, then the function should read an integer input; if isOne is True, the function should return 1.
def func_1(isOne):

        #The program returns an integer input provided by the user, given that `isOne` is set to False. If `isOne` is True, the program would return 1 instead, but since the code specifies `return int(input())`, it returns the actual integer input.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1 if isOne is True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a boolean parameter `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it reads an integer input from the user and returns it. If `isOne` is True, it returns the integer value 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, and for each test case, the constraints are represented as pairs of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

        #The program returns a list of either strings or characters based on the value of the space condition. The list is obtained from splitting the input line by spaces if space is True, otherwise, it contains the characters of the line.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: a boolean `space` and a function `to_int`. Depending on the value of `space`, it processes an input line into either a list of strings or characters. If `to_int` is applied, it converts each item in the processed list to an integer. The function returns a list of integers if `to_int` is used, otherwise, it returns a list of strings or characters.

    return string
    #The program returns the concatenation of all integers in `arr` separated by the delimiter `sym`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a string `sym`. It concatenates all integers in `arr` into a single string, using `sym` as a separator between each integer. The final concatenated string is returned.

    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices where the substring is found within the string, starting from index 0 and moving one character at a time after each find.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. It searches for all occurrences of `substring` within `string`, starting from index 0 and moving one character at a time after each search. The function returns a list containing the starting indices of each found occurrence.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `element` present in `arr`, and returns a list of indices where `element` is found in `arr`.

    #State: arr is a list of lists, where each inner list has at least 'index' + 1 elements, and 'value' is an integer. The loop iterates through each subArray in arr, and if subArray[index] equals value, it returns subArray. If no subArray[index] equals value during the loop's execution, the function does not return anything, implying the loop completes without finding a match.
    return None
    #None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `arr`, an integer `index`, and an integer `value`. It searches through each inner list in `arr` and checks if the element at position `index` equals `value`. If a match is found, it returns the entire matching inner list. If no match is found after checking all inner lists, it returns `None`.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of inputs to determine the number of values within a specified range. It first collects `n` pairs of integers `t` and `v`. For each pair, if `t` is 1, it updates the minimum value (`start`). If `t` is 2, it updates the maximum value (`end`). If `t` is 3, it adds `v` to the list `num`. After processing all inputs, it counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if this value is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
