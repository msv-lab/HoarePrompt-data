Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints can be of three types:
   - \( k \geq x \)
   - \( k \leq x \)
   - \( k \neq x \)

2. The solution logic in `func_7` correctly handles these constraints:
   - It initializes `start` to a very small value and `end` to a very large value.
   - For each constraint, it updates `start` and `end` accordingly.
   - It collects all values that should not be included in the range in the list `num`.
   - It then counts how many values in `num` do not fall within the range `[start, end]`.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of valid \( k \) values by subtracting the count of invalid values from the total range length.

3. The logic in `func_7` ensures that:
   - Constraints of type 1 update the lower bound.
   - Constraints of type 2 update the upper bound.
   - Constraints of type 3 exclude specific values from the range.

4. The overall structure of the main program:
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - Iterates over each test case.
   - Calls `func_7` for each test case and prints the result.

Given the detailed execution summary of `func_7` and the correctness of its logic, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
