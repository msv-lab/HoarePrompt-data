t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. n is an integer representing the number of constraints for each test case, where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. a is an integer representing the type of constraint (1, 2, or 3), and x is an integer representing the value in the constraint, where 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9.
