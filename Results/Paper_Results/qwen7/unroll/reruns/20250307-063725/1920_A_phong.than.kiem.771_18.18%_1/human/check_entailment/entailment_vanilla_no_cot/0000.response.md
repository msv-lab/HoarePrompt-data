Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_7` does not handle the constraints properly. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` should be initialized based on the first constraint of type 1 and the last constraint of type 2, respectively. However, the current implementation initializes `start` to `-1`, which is incorrect.

2. **Handling Constraints**: The logic to update `start` and `end` should consider the constraints carefully. For example, if there is a constraint of type 1 with a very high value, `start` should be updated accordingly. Similarly, for type 2 constraints, `end` should be updated.

3. **Exclusion of Specific Values**: The code to exclude specific values (`num`) from the range `[start, end]` is almost correct but could be optimized. The current approach checks each value in `num` individually, which is inefficient. A more efficient way would be to use set operations to exclude these values.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def solve():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        constraints = []
        for _ in range(n):
            t, v = map(int, input().split())
            constraints.append((t, v))
        
        # Initialize start and end based on the first constraint of type 1 and the last constraint of type 2
        start = float('inf')
        end = float('-inf')
        excluded_values = set()
        
        for t, v in constraints:
            if t == 1:
                start = min(start, v)
            elif t == 2:
                end = max(end, v)
            elif t == 3:
                excluded_values.add(v)
        
        # Calculate the number of valid k values
        if start > end:
            print(0)
        else:
            valid_count = end - start + 1
            valid_count -= len(excluded_values - {start, end})
            print(valid_count)

# Read input and call the solve function
solve()
```

This corrected version ensures that `start` and `end` are correctly initialized and handles the constraints efficiently.
