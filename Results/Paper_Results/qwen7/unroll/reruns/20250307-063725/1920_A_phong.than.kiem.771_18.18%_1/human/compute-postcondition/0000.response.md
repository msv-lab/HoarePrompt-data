Output State: **`n` is an input integer, t is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3}, v is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ v â‰¤ 10^9, start and end are floating-point numbers initialized to -1 and 1000000000.0 respectively, num is a list of integers, and count_num is an integer initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
