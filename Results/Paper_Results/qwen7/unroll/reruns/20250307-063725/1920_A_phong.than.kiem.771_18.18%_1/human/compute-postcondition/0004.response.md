State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `t` is an integer in the set {1, 2, 3}, `v` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v ≤ 10^9, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000.0, `num` is an empty list, and `count_num` is an integer initialized to 0, `i` is 0**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` is initialized to 0.
- The condition for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.
- The other variables (`t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num`) do not affect the loop's execution and do not need to be adjusted.
