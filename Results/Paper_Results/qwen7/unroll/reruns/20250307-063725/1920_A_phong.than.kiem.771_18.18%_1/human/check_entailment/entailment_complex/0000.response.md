Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of integers \( k \) that satisfy a set of constraints. These constraints are provided in the form of pairs \((t, v)\) where \( t \) indicates the type of constraint and \( v \) is the value associated with the constraint.
- The main function `func_7()` correctly processes these constraints:
  - For \( t = 1 \), it updates the minimum value (`start`).
  - For \( t = 2 \), it updates the maximum value (`end`).
  - For \( t = 3 \), it stores the values in the list `num`.
- After processing all constraints, it counts the number of values in `num` that fall within the range \([start, end]\). If `start` is greater than `end`, it correctly returns 0.
- The logic for calculating the number of valid integers \( k \) is sound: it computes `end - start + 1 - count_num` if this value is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.
- All supporting functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`, `func_6`) are not directly involved in the core logic of solving the problem but are part of the overall program structure. They do not affect the correctness of the main logic.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the implementation appears to handle all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
