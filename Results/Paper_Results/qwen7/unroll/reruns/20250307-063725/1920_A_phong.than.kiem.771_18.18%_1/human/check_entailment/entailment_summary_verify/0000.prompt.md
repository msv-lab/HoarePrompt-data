You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 7 : The function processes a series of inputs to determine the number of values within a specified range. It first collects `n` pairs of integers `t` and `v`. For each pair, if `t` is 1, it updates the minimum value (`start`). If `t` is 2, it updates the maximum value (`end`). If `t` is 3, it adds `v` to the list `num`. After processing all inputs, it counts how many values in `num` fall within the range `[start, end]`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns `end - start + 1 - count_num` if this value is non-negative; otherwise, it returns 0.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the constraints and calculate the number of valid integers \( k \). Specifically, the program has a logical error in how it processes the constraints. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The variables `start` and `end` are initialized incorrectly. `start` is set to `-1`, which is not a valid starting point for finding the range of valid integers. `end` is set to `1000000000.0`, which is too large and not necessary.

2. **Processing Constraints**: The program correctly updates `start` and `end` based on constraints of types 1 and 2. However, it fails to properly exclude the values specified in constraints of type 3. The variable `count_num` is used to count the number of excluded values, but this count is not subtracted from the total range correctly.

3. **Final Calculation**: The final calculation `end - start + 1 - count_num` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap between the ranges and the excluded values. For example, consider the following constraints:
   - \( k \geq 3 \)
   - \( k \leq 10 \)
   - \( k \neq 1 \)
   - \( k \neq 5 \)

   The correct range of valid integers is \( 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 \), which gives 7 valid integers. However, the program would incorrectly calculate the range as \( 10 - 3 + 1 - 2 = 8 \), which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly handle the exclusion of specific values and ensure that the final count is accurate. A more robust approach would involve maintaining a set of excluded values and calculating the range after processing all constraints.
