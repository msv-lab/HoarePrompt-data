Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for i in num:`. This means the loop variable is `i`, and the iterable is `num`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is `count_num` is 0.

3. **Understand the Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, the iterable `num` must contain at least one element. The loop variable `i` will take the value of each element in `num` one by one.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of `num`. Since `count_num` is 0, it doesn't provide information about the contents of `num`. Therefore, we need to focus on `num`.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `num`. Specifically, `num` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`count_num` is 0, `num` must contain at least one element**
