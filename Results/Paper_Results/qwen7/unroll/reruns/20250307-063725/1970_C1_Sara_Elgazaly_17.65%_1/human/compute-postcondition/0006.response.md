Output State: **s is False, x is the last node in the path traced by the loop, y is undefined.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in any of the lists within the dictionary `lst`. Each iteration of the loop pops an element from the list associated with the current value of `x` and sets it as the new value of `x`. This process continues until the list associated with `x` becomes empty, at which point `s` is toggled (changed from `True` to `False` or vice versa). Since the loop starts with `s` being `True`, it will be `False` when the loop ends. The final value of `x` will be the last node visited during the traversal, as the loop stops when no more nodes can be popped from `lst[x]`. The variable `y` is set but not used outside the inner loop, so its value is not relevant to the final state.
