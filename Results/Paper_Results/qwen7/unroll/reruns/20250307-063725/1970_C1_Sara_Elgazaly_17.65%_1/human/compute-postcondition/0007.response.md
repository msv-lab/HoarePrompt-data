Output State: **`s` is True, `x` is the last node in the path traced by the loop, `y` is undefined**.

The code `s = not s` changes the value of `s` from `False` to `True`. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is the last node in the path traced by the loop. The variable `y` remains undefined since no assignment or initialization was performed on it within the given code snippet.
