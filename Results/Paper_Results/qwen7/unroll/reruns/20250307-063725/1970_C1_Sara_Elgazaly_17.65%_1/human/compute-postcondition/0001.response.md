Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; `lst` is a defaultdict with default value as list.**

The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` with a default factory of `list`. This means that `lst` can be used to store lists of values for each key. However, no keys have been added to `lst` yet, so it remains an empty defaultdict. All other variables retain their initial states.
