Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with variables n, t, u, v, and a list of integers for the starting node(s). It checks if n is an integer within the range 2 to 2 Ã— 10^5, t is 1, u and v are integers within the range 1 to n, and the list of starting nodes contains exactly one integer within the range 1 to n. Based on these conditions, it returns specific values or messages as per the given constraints.**
