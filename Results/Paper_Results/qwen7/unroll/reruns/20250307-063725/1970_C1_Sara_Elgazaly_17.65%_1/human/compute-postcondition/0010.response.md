Functionality: **The function reads input to construct an undirected graph and then traverses it to determine whether to print "Hermione" or "Ron". It does not accept any parameters but uses variables `x`, `y`, `lst`, and implicitly `n`, `t`, `u`, `v` from the global scope. After constructing the graph, it starts from node `x` and follows a specific traversal pattern, flipping a boolean `s` at each step. If `s` is `False` after the traversal, it prints "Hermione"; otherwise, it prints "Ron".**
