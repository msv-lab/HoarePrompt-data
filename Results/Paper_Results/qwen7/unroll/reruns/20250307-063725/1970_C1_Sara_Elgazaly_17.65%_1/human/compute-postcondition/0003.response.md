Output State: **x is an integer obtained from the first input split, y is an integer obtained from the second input split, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n; lst is a defaultdict where each key is an integer between 1 and n, and the corresponding value is a list of integers representing the nodes connected to the key node by an edge. The loop constructs an undirected graph using the input edges.**
