Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input split, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input split, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) contains exactly one integer such that 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n.**

This means that the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged from their initial state, while `x` and `y` are now assigned the integer values obtained from the first and second inputs respectively, split using the `map(int, input().split())` function.
