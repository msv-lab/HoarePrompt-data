Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements: three integers (x, y, z) followed by one string (res), printed in that order.

Each line will show the values of x, y, z generated by `randint(1, 9)` for each iteration of the loop, followed by the value of res, which is determined based on the conditions given in the loop body. The value of res can be either 'peak', 'stair', or 'none', depending on the comparison results of x, y, and z.

The exact values of x, y, z, and res will vary randomly with each iteration, but there will be a total of 1000 such lines as the loop runs from i=1 to i=1000.
