You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
from random import randint

def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        y = randint(1, 9)
        z = randint(1, 9)
        res = ''
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')
        print(res)
        i += 1



- Function Summary: 
The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the string is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the string is 'stair'; otherwise, the string is 'none'. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description vs. Provided Program**: The provided program does not match the problem description in several ways.
   - The problem specifies that there will be multiple test cases, with an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. However, the provided program generates 1000 random test cases internally and prints them out without any input from the user.
   - The program should take input from the user for each test case, but it does not do so.
   - The program should output "STAIR", "PEAK", or "NONE" for each test case based on the conditions given, but instead, it prints the generated numbers and a random string ("peak" or "none") without considering the actual conditions.

2. **Test Cases**: The example provided in the problem description shows specific test cases, but the program does not handle these cases correctly. It generates its own random test cases and does not validate them according to the specified conditions.

3. **Conditions Check**: The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak are not implemented correctly. The program does not check if `a < b < c` for a stair or `a < b > c` for a peak. Instead, it uses a simple comparison logic that does not accurately reflect the conditions.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Correctness: False
