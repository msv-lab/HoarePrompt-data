You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    i = 1
    while i <= 1000:
        x = randint(1, 9)
        
        y = randint(1, 9)
        
        z = randint(1, 9)
        
        res = ''
        
        if x < y:
            if y > z:
                res = 'peak'
            elif y < z:
                res = 'stair'
            else:
                res = 'none'
        else:
            res = 'none'
        
        print(x, y, z, sep=' ')

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements: three integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) representing `x`, `y`, and `z`, and a string representing `res`. 
    #
    #The first two integers (`x` and `y`) will be compared, and based on their relationship, the third integer (`z`), and the value of `res` will be determined as follows:
    #- If `x < y` and `y > z`, then `res` will be 'peak'.
    #- If `x < y` and `y < z`, then `res` will be 'stair'.
    #- If `x < y` and `y == z`, or if `x >= y`, then `res` will be 'none'.
    #
    #Each line will be formatted as `x y z res`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are randomly generated integers from 1 to 9, and `res` is one of the strings 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the string is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the string is 'stair'; otherwise, the string is 'none'. The function does not return any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program is a test function that generates random digits and prints them along with a result based on a simple conditional check. However, this does not solve the actual problem described. The problem requires processing input from the user and determining whether the given digits form a stair, a peak, or neither. The provided function does not read input or handle the logic required to determine the type of sequence based on the input values. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
