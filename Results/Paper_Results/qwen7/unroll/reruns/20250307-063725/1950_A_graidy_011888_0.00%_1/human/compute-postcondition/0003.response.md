Output State: The output state will consist of 1000 lines, each containing four elements: three integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) representing `x`, `y`, and `z`, and a string representing `res`. 

The first two integers (`x` and `y`) will be compared, and based on their relationship, the third integer (`z`), and the value of `res` will be determined as follows:
- If `x < y` and `y > z`, then `res` will be 'peak'.
- If `x < y` and `y < z`, then `res` will be 'stair'.
- If `x < y` and `y == z`, or if `x >= y`, then `res` will be 'none'.

Each line will be formatted as `x y z res`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are randomly generated integers from 1 to 9, and `res` is one of the strings 'peak', 'stair', or 'none'.
