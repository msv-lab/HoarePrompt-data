Functionality: **The function generates and prints 1000 lines of output. Each line contains three random integers between 1 and 9 (inclusive) and a string ('peak', 'stair', or 'none'). The string is determined based on the comparison of these integers: if the first integer is less than the second and the second is greater than the third, the string is 'peak'; if the first is less than the second and the second is less than the third, the string is 'stair'; otherwise, the string is 'none'. The function does not return any value.**
