Output State: **`i` is 1**

The code initializes `i` to 1. Since the initial value of `t` (an integer between 1 and 1000) and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` (integers between 0 and 9) are not affected by this line of code, they remain as they were in the initial state. The only change is that `i` is now explicitly set to 1.
