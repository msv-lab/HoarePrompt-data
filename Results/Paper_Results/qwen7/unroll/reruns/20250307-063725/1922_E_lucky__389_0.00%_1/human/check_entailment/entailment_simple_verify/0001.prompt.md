You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The solution involves breaking down \(X-1\) into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of the increasing subsequences.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the product of the binomial coefficients corresponding to the lengths of the subsequences.
   - Specifically, if we have a sequence of numbers where the lengths of the increasing subsequences are \(2^k\), the total number of increasing subsequences is \((X-1)\).

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into the sum of powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding length to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs the array `ansv` using these lengths.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \(X = 2\), the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty subsequence (the element itself).
   - For larger values of \(X\), the construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

5. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the decomposition of \(X-1\) into powers of 2.
   - The constructed array will indeed have the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, providing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to construct an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.
