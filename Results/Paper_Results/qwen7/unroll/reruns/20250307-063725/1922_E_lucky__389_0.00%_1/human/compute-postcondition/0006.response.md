Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i` where `i` was not 0, `ansv` is a list of integers ranging from 0 to `mx-1`, and `x` is 0.**

Explanation: The code creates a list `ansv` using a list comprehension that includes all integers in the range from 0 to `mx-1`. The values of `mx`, `subseq_lens`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.
