### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The solution involves breaking down \(X-1\) into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of the increasing subsequences.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the product of the binomial coefficients corresponding to the lengths of the subsequences.
   - Specifically, if we have a sequence of numbers where the lengths of the increasing subsequences are \(2^k\), the total number of increasing subsequences is \((X-1)\).

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into the sum of powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding length to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs the array `ansv` using these lengths.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \(X = 2\), the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty subsequence (the element itself).
   - For larger values of \(X\), the construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

5. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the decomposition of \(X-1\) into powers of 2.
   - However, the way the array `ansv` is constructed may not always produce the correct number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Issue with the Current Implementation:**
   - The current implementation constructs the array `ansv` by simply appending the lengths of the subsequences found in `subseq_lens`. This approach does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.
   - For example, consider \(X = 13\). The decomposition would give us \(13 - 1 = 12\), and the binary representation of 12 is \(1100_2\), which corresponds to the lengths \([3, 2]\). The array constructed would be \([0, 1, 2, 0, 1]\), but this does not necessarily have exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

7. **Correct Approach:**
   - To ensure the correct number of increasing subsequences, we need to carefully construct the array such that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\). One possible approach is to use a combination of zeros and ones to achieve the desired count.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to construct an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. The current implementation does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
