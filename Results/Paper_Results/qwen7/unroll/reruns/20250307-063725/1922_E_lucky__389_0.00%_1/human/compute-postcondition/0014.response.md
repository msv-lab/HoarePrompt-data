Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing test cases (t) where each test case involves an integer X. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000 and 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, it processes these values without specifying the exact output for each case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over `t` test cases, each involving an integer `X`, and performs some unspecified operation or validation on these values. However, the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
