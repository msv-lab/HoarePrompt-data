Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The logic to calculate the required lengths of the subsequence is flawed. Specifically, the while loop and the subtraction of `2 ** i - 1` do not correctly determine the necessary subsequence lengths to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

2. **Array Construction**: The constructed array does not necessarily have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The current approach does not ensure that the number of increasing subsequences is precisely `X`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is small or when it is not possible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use combinatorial mathematics to determine the exact lengths of the subsequence segments needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences. This involves understanding the relationship between binomial coefficients and the number of increasing subsequences in a sequence.

Here is a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

1. **Determine Required Segment Lengths**: Use the fact that the number of increasing subsequences of length `k` in an array of length `n` can be calculated using binomial coefficients.
2. **Construct the Array**: Construct the array by concatenating segments of appropriate lengths to achieve exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

This requires a deeper understanding of combinatorics and may involve more complex calculations and checks.
