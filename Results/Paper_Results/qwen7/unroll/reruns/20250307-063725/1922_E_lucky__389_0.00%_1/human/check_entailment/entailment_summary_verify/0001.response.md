### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The solution involves breaking down \(X-1\) into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of the increasing subsequences.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the product of the binomial coefficients corresponding to the lengths of the subsequences.
   - Specifically, if we have a sequence of numbers where the lengths of the increasing subsequences are \(2^k\), the total number of increasing subsequences is \((X-1)\).

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into the sum of powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding length to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs the array `ansv` using these lengths.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \(X = 2\), the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty subsequence (the element itself).
   - For larger values of \(X\), the construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

5. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the decomposition of \(X-1\) into powers of 2.
   - However, the implementation of constructing the array `ansv` is flawed. The current approach does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, providing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Decomposition of \(X-1\):**
  - The code correctly decomposes \(X-1\) into the sum of powers of 2. This part is correct.

- **Constructing the Array:**
  - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the maximum value \(i\) and the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element.
  - This construction does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. For example, consider \(X = 13\):
    - Decomposing \(12\) (which is \(X-1\)) into powers of 2 gives us \(2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1\).
    - The code constructs the array as `[3, 2, 1]`, but this does not necessarily result in exactly 13 increasing subsequences.

- **Example Counter-Example:**
  - For \(X = 13\):
    - Decomposition: \(12 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1\).
    - Constructed array: `[3, 2, 1]`.
    - The number of increasing subsequences in `[3, 2, 1]` is not 13. Instead, it is much smaller because the elements are not chosen to maximize the number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly construct an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. The decomposition of \(X-1\) into powers of 2 is correct, but the construction of the array `ansv` does not ensure that the resulting array has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
