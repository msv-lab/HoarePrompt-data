Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an array of integers such that it has exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The solution provided uses a mathematical approach to construct such an array.

2. **Key Insight**: The number of increasing subsequences of a sequence can be determined by the lengths of its longest increasing subsequences (LIS). Specifically, if we have an array where the first part consists of numbers from 0 to \(k-1\) repeated \(2^k - 1\) times, followed by numbers from \(k\) to \(m-1\) repeated \(2^m - 1\) times, etc., the total number of increasing subsequences will be the sum of powers of 2 up to the point where the sum equals \(X\).

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The program correctly calculates the necessary lengths of the increasing subsequences using the binary representation of \(X - 1\).
   - It constructs the array by repeating each number \(2^i - 1\) times, where \(i\) is derived from the binary representation of \(X - 1\).
   - The constructed array ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When \(X = 2\), the array should contain a single element, which is 0.
   - For other values of \(X\), the construction process correctly generates the required array.

5. **Verification**:
   - The program handles the input and output formats correctly.
   - The logic for constructing the array is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly solves the problem as stated.

Correctness: **True**
