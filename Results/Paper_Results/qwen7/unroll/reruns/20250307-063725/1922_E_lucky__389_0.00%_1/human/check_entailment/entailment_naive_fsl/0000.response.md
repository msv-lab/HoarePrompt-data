Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, but it does not handle the case where `X` is a prime number. For a prime number `X`, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences because the number of increasing subsequences would always be a product of smaller numbers (e.g., powers of 2). The program does not account for this scenario, leading to incorrect outputs for prime values of `X`.

For example, if `X = 3`, which is a prime number, the program will attempt to generate an array but will fail to produce the correct output as specified in the problem description.
