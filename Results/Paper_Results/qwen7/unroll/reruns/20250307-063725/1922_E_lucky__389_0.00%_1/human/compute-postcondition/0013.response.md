Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i` where `i` was not 0.
- `ansv` is a list containing all the values of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end.
- `x` is 0.

The loop prints each element of `ansv` starting from index 1 to the end, separated by spaces. Since `x` is 0, it does not affect the contents of `ansv`.

Given that `ansv` contains all the values of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end, the print statement will output these values separated by spaces.

Output: **the values in ansv from index 1 to the end, separated by spaces**
