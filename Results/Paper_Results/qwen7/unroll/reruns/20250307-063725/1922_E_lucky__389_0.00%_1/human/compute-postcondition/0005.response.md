Output State: **mx is the maximum value of i found during the loop, subseq_lens is a list containing all the values of i where i was not 0, and x is 0.**

Explanation: During each iteration of the outer while loop, the inner while loop calculates the highest power of 2 (represented by `i`) that can be subtracted from `x + 1` without making it negative. If `i` is not zero, it means there's a valid segment length that can be added to `subseq_lens`, and `x` is updated by subtracting `2^i - 1`. The maximum value of `i` found during these operations is stored in `mx`. This process continues until `x` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
