Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop, `subseq_lens` is a list containing all the values of `i` where `i` was not 0, `ansv` is a list containing all the values of `subseq_lens` from index 1 to the end, and `x` is 0. The loop prints each element of `ansv` starting from index 1 to the end, separated by spaces.**
