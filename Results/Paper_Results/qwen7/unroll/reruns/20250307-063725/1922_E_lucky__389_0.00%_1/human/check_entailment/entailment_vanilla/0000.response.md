### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences.
   - The number of increasing subsequences is given by \(X\).
   - The solution involves breaking down \(X-1\) into powers of 2, which represent the lengths of the increasing subsequences.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - The number of increasing subsequences in an array can be represented as the product of the binomial coefficients corresponding to the lengths of the subsequences.
   - Specifically, if we have a sequence of numbers where the lengths of the increasing subsequences are \(2^k\), the total number of increasing subsequences is \((X-1)\).

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - The code attempts to decompose \(X-1\) into the sum of powers of 2.
   - For each power of 2, it appends the corresponding length to `subseq_lens`.
   - It then constructs the array `ansv` using these lengths.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If \(X = 2\), the array `[0]` has exactly one increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence) and one non-empty subsequence (the element itself).
   - For larger values of \(X\), the construction ensures that the number of increasing subsequences matches \(X\).

5. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly handles the decomposition of \(X-1\) into powers of 2.
   - The constructed array will indeed have the required number of increasing subsequences.

6. **Output Format:**
   - The output format is correct, providing the length of the array followed by the array elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to construct an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
