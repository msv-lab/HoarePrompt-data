Functionality: **The function processes an integer input \(X\) (where \(2 \leq X \leq 10^{18}\)) to generate a sequence of integers based on certain conditions. It calculates the maximum value \(i\) for which \(2^{i+1} \leq X + 1\), and constructs a list `subseq_lens` containing all such values of \(i\). Then, it creates another list `ansv` that combines the maximum value \(i\) and the elements of `subseq_lens` starting from the second element. Finally, it prints the length of `ansv` followed by its elements, each separated by a space.**
