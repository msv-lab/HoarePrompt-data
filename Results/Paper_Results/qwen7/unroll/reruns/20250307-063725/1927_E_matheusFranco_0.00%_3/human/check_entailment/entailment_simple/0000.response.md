Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of continuous segments of length k is no more than 1.
2. The provided program has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
3. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case, calling `func_1` for each one.
4. `func_1` constructs a permutation based on the given n and k. However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly generate a k-level permutation. Specifically, it initializes a list with zeros and sets every k-th element starting from the first position to consecutive values, which does not guarantee the k-level property.
5. The provided output for the example test cases in the annotated program does not match the expected k-level permutations. For instance, the output for the test case "2 2" is `2 0 2 0 2 0`, which is incorrect because it does not satisfy the k-level condition (the sums of continuous segments of length 2 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2).
6. The correct approach would involve generating a sequence that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1. One possible correct approach could be to use a pattern that alternates between high and low values to balance the sums.

Given the above reasoning, the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
