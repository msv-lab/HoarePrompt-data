Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**: This function constructs a permutation of length \( n \) based on the given \( k \). It initializes a list `permutation` of zeros and then fills specific indices with values based on the pattern involving \( k \). However, the logic used in `func_1()` does not ensure that the resulting permutation meets the requirement of being a \( k \)-level permutation. Specifically, the current implementation does not guarantee that the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \) will have a difference of no more than 1.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function handles multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases \( t \) and then calls `func_1()` for each test case. The function correctly processes all test cases until \( t \) reaches 0. However, since `func_1()` does not produce a \( k \)-level permutation, the overall correctness of the program is compromised.

Given the problem statement and the need for a \( k \)-level permutation, the current implementation of `func_1()` does not meet the requirements. Therefore, the program as provided is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
