Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`. Additionally, the loop is iterating based on the value of `k`, which is an input obtained from the user.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `permutation` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
   - `n` is an integer obtained from the input split by space.
   - `k` is an integer obtained from the input split by space.
   - `idx` is 0.
   - `idx_v` is 1.
   - `curr_v` is 1.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop `for i in range(k)` will execute if `k` is at least 1.
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from 0 to `k-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `k`, `k` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `i` (the loop variable) will be 0 when the loop starts.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` and `i`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`k` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
