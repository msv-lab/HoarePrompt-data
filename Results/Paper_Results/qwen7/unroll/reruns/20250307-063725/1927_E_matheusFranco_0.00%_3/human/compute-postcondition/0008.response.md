Output State: **`permutation` is a list where every element at index `i` (where `i` is a multiple of `k` plus `i` for each iteration of the outer loop) is set to the value of `curr_v` incremented from 1, and all other elements remain 0; `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` converted to strings and joined by spaces; `n` is the length of the permutation list; `k` is the integer obtained from the input split by space; `idx` is 0; `idx_v` is 1; `curr_v` is `k * (k + 1) // 2 + 1`.**

Explanation: The code converts the list `permutation` into a string `result` where each element of `permutation` is converted to a string and joined by spaces. The values of `n`, `k`, `idx`, `idx_v`, and `curr_v` remain unchanged. The list `permutation` itself is not altered by this operation.
