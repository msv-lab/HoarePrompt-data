The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from user input, where \( 2 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( k \) is even. It then constructs a list named `permutation` of length \( n \), setting specific indices to values based on a pattern involving \( k \). Finally, it prints the modified list as a space-separated string. If the input conditions are not met, the function does not return anything specific but ensures the input validation is performed.
