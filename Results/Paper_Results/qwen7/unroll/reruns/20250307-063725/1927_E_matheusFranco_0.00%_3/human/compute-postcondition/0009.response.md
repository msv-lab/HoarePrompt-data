Let's break down the initial state and the code step by step:

1. **Initialization of `permutation`:**
   - `permutation` is a list where every element at index `i` (where `i` is a multiple of `k` plus `i` for each iteration of the outer loop) is set to the value of `curr_v` incremented from 1, and all other elements remain 0.
   - `curr_v` is initially set to `k * (k + 1) // 2 + 1`.

2. **Determine `curr_v`:**
   - Given `k = 1` (assuming `k` is an integer obtained from the input, but since no specific value is given, let's assume `k = 1` for simplicity):
     \[
     curr_v = k * (k + 1) // 2 + 1 = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 + 1 = 1 * 2 // 2 + 1 = 1 * 1 + 1 = 2
     \]
   - So, `curr_v` is 2.

3. **Constructing `permutation`:**
   - For `k = 1`, the indices where `permutation[i]` will be set to 2 are those where `i` is a multiple of 1 plus `i` itself, i.e., `i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`.
   - Therefore, `permutation` will look like `[2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, ...]` with 2s at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., and 0s elsewhere.

4. **Determine `n`:**
   - `n` is the length of the `permutation` list. Since no specific length is mentioned, let's assume `n` is large enough to show the pattern clearly. For simplicity, let's consider `n = 6`:
     \[
     permutation = [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0]
     \]

5. **Convert `permutation` to a string and join by spaces:**
   - `result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` converted to strings and joined by spaces.
   - `result = "2 0 2 0 2 0"`

6. **Print `result`:**
   - The `print(result)` statement will print the string `"2 0 2 0 2 0"`.

Output: **2 0 2 0 2 0**
