Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` where `k` is even and within the range 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5. It does not return any value explicitly but processes the given inputs according to the specified conditions.**
