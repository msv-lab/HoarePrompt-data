Output State: `permutation` is a list where every element at index `i` (where `i` is a multiple of `k` plus `i` for each iteration of the outer loop) is set to the value of `curr_v` incremented by the number of times the inner loop has executed for that particular `i`. `n` is the length of the `permutation` list, `k` is the integer obtained from the input split by space, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k * (k + 1)`.

To break it down:
- For each `i` in the range of `k`, the inner loop sets elements in `permutation` at indices that are multiples of `k + i` to consecutive values starting from `1`.
- The value of `curr_v` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each assignment.
- After all iterations, `permutation` will contain values from 1 to `k * (k + 1)` placed at specific indices determined by the loop conditions.
