You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and k is even.
def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))
    permutation = [0] * n
    idx = 0
    idx_v = 1
    curr_v = 1
    for i in range(k):
        multiples_of_k_plus_i = i
        
        while multiples_of_k_plus_i < len(permutation):
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_i] = curr_v
            curr_v += 1
            multiples_of_k_plus_i += k
        
    #State: Output State: `permutation` is a list where every element at index `i` (where `i` is a multiple of `k` plus `i` for each iteration of the outer loop) is set to the value of `curr_v` incremented from 1, and all other elements remain 0. `n` is the length of the permutation list, `k` is the integer obtained from the input split by space, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k * (k + 1) // 2 + 1`.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: 2 0 2 0 2 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It returns an error message if k is not even or if the conditions 2 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 are not met. If the conditions are met, it does not return anything specific but validates the inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
