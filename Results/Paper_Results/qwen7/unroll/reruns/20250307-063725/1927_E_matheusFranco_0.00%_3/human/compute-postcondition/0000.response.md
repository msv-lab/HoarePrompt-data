Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. This integer represents the number of test cases. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer remains valid, and the values of `n` and `k` are not yet defined and thus remain unspecified in this output state.
