Reasoning:
- The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where a k-level permutation ensures that the maximum difference between the sums of any two continuous segments of length k is at most 1.
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` handles the overall structure of reading test cases and calling `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from user input, constructs a permutation based on a specific pattern, and prints the result.

Let's analyze `func_1` to see if it meets the requirements:
- The function initializes a list `permutation` of length \( n \) filled with zeros.
- It then iterates over the range \( k \) and sets specific indices in the `permutation` list to values based on a pattern involving \( k \).
- Specifically, it sets elements at positions \( i, i+k, i+2k, \ldots \) to increasing values starting from 1.

To check if this approach generates a k-level permutation:
- Consider the sums of continuous segments of length \( k \):
  - For example, if \( n = 10 \) and \( k = 4 \), the constructed permutation might look like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.
  - The sums of segments would be:
    - \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 \)
    - \( 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 14 \)
    - \( 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 18 \)
    - \( 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22 \)
    - \( 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26 \)
    - \( 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 30 \)
    - \( 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 34 \)

- The differences between these sums are:
  - \( 14 - 10 = 4 \)
  - \( 18 - 14 = 4 \)
  - \( 22 - 18 = 4 \)
  - \( 26 - 22 = 4 \)
  - \( 30 - 26 = 4 \)
  - \( 34 - 30 = 4 \)

- Clearly, the differences are more than 1, indicating that this approach does not generate a k-level permutation.

Given the above analysis, the provided function does not correctly generate a k-level permutation as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
