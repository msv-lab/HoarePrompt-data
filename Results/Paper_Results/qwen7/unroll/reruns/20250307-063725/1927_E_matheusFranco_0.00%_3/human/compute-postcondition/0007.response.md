Output State: `permutation` is a list where every element at index `i` (where `i` is a multiple of `k` plus `i` for each iteration of the outer loop) is set to the value of `curr_v` incremented from 1, and all other elements remain 0. `n` is the length of the permutation list, `k` is the integer obtained from the input split by space, `idx` is 0, `idx_v` is 1, `curr_v` is `k * (k + 1) // 2 + 1`.
