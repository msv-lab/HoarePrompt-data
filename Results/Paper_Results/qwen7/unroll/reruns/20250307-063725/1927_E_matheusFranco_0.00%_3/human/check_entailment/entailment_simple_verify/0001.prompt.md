You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a loop to fill the `permutation` list in a specific pattern. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, while `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts from `i` and increments by `k`.
   - The value `curr_v` is incremented and assigned to positions in the `permutation` list according to the calculated indices.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The pattern used in `func_1` is to place values in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.
   - Specifically, it places values in a repeating sequence: `[1, 2, ..., k]`, then `[k+1, k+2, ..., 2k]`, and so on.
   - This pattern ensures that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will be consecutive integers, thus satisfying the k-level condition.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and decrements `t` after processing each test case.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The pattern used in `func_1` is correct and guarantees that the permutation will be k-level.
   - The implementation handles multiple test cases correctly by using `func_2`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the required logic to generate a k-level permutation.
