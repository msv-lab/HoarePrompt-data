Output State: **t is 0.**

Natural Language Description: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be reduced by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 0. Since `t` initially represents the number of test cases and is decremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop, once all test cases have been processed, `t` will be 0.
