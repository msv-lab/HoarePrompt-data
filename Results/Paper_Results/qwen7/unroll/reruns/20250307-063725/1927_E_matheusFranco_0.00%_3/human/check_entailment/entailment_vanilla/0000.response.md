### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate a k-level permutation of length n. A k-level permutation ensures that the difference between the maximum and minimum sums of any continuous segment of length k is at most 1.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input.
   - It initializes a list `permutation` of length `n` with zeros.
   - It uses a loop to fill the `permutation` list in a specific pattern. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, while `multiples_of_k_plus_i` starts from `i` and increments by `k`.
   - The value `curr_v` is incremented and assigned to positions in the `permutation` list according to the calculated indices.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The pattern used in `func_1` is to place values in a way that ensures the sums of continuous segments of length `k` do not differ by more than 1.
   - Specifically, it places values in a repeating sequence: `[1, 2, ..., k]`, then `[k+1, k+2, ..., 2k]`, and so on.
   - This pattern ensures that the sums of any continuous segment of length `k` will be consecutive integers, thus satisfying the k-level condition.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case and decrements `t` after processing each test case.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The pattern used in `func_1` is correct and guarantees that the permutation will be k-level.
   - The implementation handles multiple test cases correctly by using `func_2`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions correctly implement the required logic to generate a k-level permutation.

Correctness: **True**
