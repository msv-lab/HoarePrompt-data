Output State: The value of `cons` after all iterations of the loop.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `t` is non-zero. In each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. The rest of the loop body involves operations on the results of function `R()` and some local variables that are reset or modified within each iteration. However, the final output is determined by the value of `cons`, which is calculated based on various conditions and operations performed during each iteration. Since `t` starts from a positive integer up to \(10^4\) and is decremented by 1 in each iteration, the loop will eventually terminate when `t` becomes zero. At that point, the value of `cons` will be printed, representing the final state of the loop's execution.
