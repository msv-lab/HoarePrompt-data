Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple integers, and maps those integers to integers. This function does not assign values to any variables directly but rather provides a way to read input. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the only new information is the definition of the `R` function.
