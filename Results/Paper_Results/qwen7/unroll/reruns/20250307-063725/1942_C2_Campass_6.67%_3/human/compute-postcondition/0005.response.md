Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result based on the given constraints and input data for each test case.**

This means the function processes input data structured into test cases, where each test case contains specific integers and a list of distinct integers. The function does not take any parameters itself but works with the provided input data to produce the required output.
