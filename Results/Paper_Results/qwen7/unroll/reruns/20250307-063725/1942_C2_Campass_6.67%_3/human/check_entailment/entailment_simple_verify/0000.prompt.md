You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be the minimum value between \(n-2\) and \(x + sx - 2\), where \(sx\) is calculated based on the operations within the loop. The exact value of \(sx\) depends on the specific sequence generated by `R()` and the values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #To explain further, the loop processes the list `l` which is sorted and modified, then calculates `sx` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list. It also updates `y` and adds to `sx` accordingly. Finally, it prints the minimum of \(n-2\) and \(x + sx - 2\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the chosen vertices and additional vertices can be used to form triangles, and it incorrectly calculates the number of triangles that can be formed.

To illustrate, let's consider the example given in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
3
8 4 2
1 6 2 5
7 3 1
6 4 3
4 2 2
1 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
6
5
2
```

However, the program provided outputs:
```
6
5
2
```

This seems to match the expected output, but let's analyze the logic:

1. **Test Case 1:**
   - \( n = 8 \), \( x = 4 \), \( y = 2 \)
   - Chosen vertices: \( [1, 6, 2, 5] \)
   - The program sorts the chosen vertices and calculates the gaps between them. It then tries to maximize the number of triangles by considering the gaps and the additional vertices.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - \( n = 7 \), \( x = 3 \), \( y = 1 \)
   - Chosen vertices: \( [6, 4, 3] \)
   - The program again sorts the chosen vertices and calculates the gaps, but with a smaller \( n \).

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - \( n = 4 \), \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 \)
   - Chosen vertices: \( [1, 3] \)
   - The program calculates the gaps and tries to form triangles.

The issue lies in how the program handles the gaps and the calculation of triangles. The program does not correctly account for the fact that the chosen vertices and additional vertices can be used to form triangles. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the formation of triangles from the gaps and the additional vertices.

A correct solution would involve a different approach to calculate the number of triangles that can be formed using the chosen vertices and the additional vertices. The current implementation does not fully address this requirement, leading to potential errors in certain cases.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
