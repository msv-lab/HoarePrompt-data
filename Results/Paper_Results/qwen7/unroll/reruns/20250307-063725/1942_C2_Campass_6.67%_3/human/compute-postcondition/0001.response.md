Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

Explanation: The variable `t` is initially a positive integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\). The line `t, = R()` assigns the first element of the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()` to `t`. Since `R()` returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping them to integers, `t` now holds the first element of this tuple. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains valid, and it is now also specified that `t` is specifically the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`.
