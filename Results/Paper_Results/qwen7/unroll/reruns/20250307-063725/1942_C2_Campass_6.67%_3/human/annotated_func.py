#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, x, and y are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the first line of each test case contains three integers n, x, and y; the second line of each test case contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: Output State: The output state will be the minimum value between \(n-2\) and \(x + sx - 2\), where \(sx\) is calculated based on the operations within the loop. The exact value of \(sx\) depends on the specific sequence generated by `R()` and the values of `x` and `y`.
    #
    #To explain further, the loop processes the list `l` which is sorted and modified, then calculates `sx` based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list. It also updates `y` and adds to `sx` accordingly. Finally, it prints the minimum of \(n-2\) and \(x + sx - 2\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value based on these inputs and the differences between consecutive elements in the list of integers. Finally, it outputs the minimum value between \(n-2\) and \(x + sx - 2\), where \(sx\) is derived from the calculations performed during the function's execution.
