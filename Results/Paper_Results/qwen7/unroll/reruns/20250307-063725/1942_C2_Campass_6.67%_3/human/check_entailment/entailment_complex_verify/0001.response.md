### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `x`, and `y` for each case.
   - The list of chosen vertices `l` is read and sorted.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - `sx` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of segments of length 1.
   - The list `val` is constructed by calculating the lengths of the segments between consecutive chosen vertices and appending `n + l[0]` to close the circle.

3. **Sorting and Processing Segments**:
   - `val` is sorted to prioritize smaller segments for processing.
   - For each segment in `val`, the code calculates how many triangles can be formed from that segment.
   - If the remaining available vertices `y` are less than half the segment length `c`, the function breaks out of the loop and adds `y * 2` to `sx`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the full segment length `i` to `sx` and reduces `y` by half the segment length `c`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Triangles**:
   - The variable `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which represents the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.
   - This value is then capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in the polygon.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated `cons` for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Segment Calculation**:
  - The segment lengths are calculated correctly using `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1`. However, the segment length should be calculated as `c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1` but considering the circular nature of the polygon, it should be adjusted to handle wrap-around properly.
  - The addition of `n + l[0]` to close the circle is correct but could be simplified to just `l.append(l[0])` since `n` is the last element in the list after sorting.

- **Triangle Formation**:
  - The logic for forming triangles from segments is correct. The function correctly handles the breaking condition when `y < c` and adds `y * 2` to `sx`.
  - The sorting of `val` based on `(1 - x & 1, x)` ensures that shorter segments are processed first, which helps in maximizing the number of triangles.

- **Capping the Result**:
  - The final value `cons` is correctly capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the maximum possible number of triangles in the polygon.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the example provided:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `8 4 2`
  - Chosen vertices: `[1, 6, 2, 5]`
  - Sorted list: `[1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 1]`
  - Segment lengths: `[1, 3, 1, 1, 7]`
  - After sorting: `[1, 1, 1, 3, 7]`
  - Processing segments:
    - First segment: `1` -> `sx += 1`
    - Second segment: `1` -> `sx += 1`
    - Third segment: `1` -> `sx += 1`
    - Fourth segment: `3` -> `y -= 1` (since `y < 2`), `sx += 2`
  - Total triangles: `4 + 2 - 2 = 4` (capped at `8 - 2 = 6`)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `7 3 1`
  - Chosen vertices: `[6, 4, 3]`
  - Sorted list: `[3, 4, 6, 7, 1]`
  - Segment lengths: `[3, 2, 1, 4]`
  - After sorting: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Processing segments:
    - First segment: `1` -> `sx += 1`
    - Second segment: `2` -> `y -= 1`, `sx += 2`
    - Third segment: `3` -> `y -= 1`, `sx += 3`
    - Fourth segment: `4` -> `y -= 2`, `sx += 4`
  - Total triangles: `3 + 4 - 2 = 5` (capped at `7 - 2 = 5`)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `4 2 2`
  - Chosen vertices: `[1, 3]`
  - Sorted list: `[1, 3, 4, 1]`
  - Segment lengths: `[2, 2]`
  - After sorting: `[2, 2]`
  - Processing segments:
    - First segment: `2` -> `y -= 1`, `sx += 2`
    - Second segment: `2` -> `y -= 1`, `sx += 2`
  - Total triangles: `2 + 2 - 2 = 2` (capped at `4 - 2 = 2`)

The function correctly calculates the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out based on the provided logic and examples.
