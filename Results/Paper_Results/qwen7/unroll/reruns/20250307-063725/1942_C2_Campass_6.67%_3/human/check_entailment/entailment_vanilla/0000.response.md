### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading `n`, `x`, and `y` for each case.
   - The list of chosen vertices `l` is read and sorted.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - `sx` is initialized to 0, which will count the number of segments of length 1.
   - The list `val` is constructed by calculating the lengths of the segments between consecutive chosen vertices and appending `n + l[0]` to close the circle.

3. **Sorting and Processing Segments**:
   - `val` is sorted to prioritize smaller segments for processing.
   - For each segment in `val`, the code calculates how many triangles can be formed from that segment.
   - If the remaining available vertices `y` are less than half the segment length `c`, the function breaks out of the loop and adds `y * 2` to `sx`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the full segment length `i` to `sx` and reduces `y` by half the segment length `c`.

4. **Calculating Maximum Triangles**:
   - The variable `cons` is calculated as `x + sx - 2`, which represents the maximum number of triangles that can be formed.
   - This value is then capped at `n - 2` to ensure it does not exceed the total number of possible triangles in the polygon.

5. **Output**:
   - The function prints the calculated `cons` for each test case.

### Analysis:
- The logic for counting the segments and forming triangles seems correct.
- The sorting and processing of segments are done efficiently.
- The constraints handling and breaking conditions are appropriately implemented.

Given the provided example and the logic, the function appears to correctly calculate the maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
