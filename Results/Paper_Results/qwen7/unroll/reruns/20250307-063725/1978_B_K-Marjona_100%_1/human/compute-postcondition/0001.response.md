Output State: The output state consists of a series of lines, each corresponding to the result of one test case. For each test case, if \(b \leq a\), the output is \(a \times n\). Otherwise, the output is \(b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a\), where \(k = \min(n, b - a)\).

This means for each test case, the output will either be the product of \(a\) and \(n\) if \(b\) is less than or equal to \(a\), or a more complex expression involving \(b\), \(a\), and \(k\) otherwise.
