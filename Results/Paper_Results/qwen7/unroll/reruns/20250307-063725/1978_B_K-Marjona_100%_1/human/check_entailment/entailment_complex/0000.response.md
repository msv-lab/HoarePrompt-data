Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. It calculates `k` as the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This value of `k` ensures that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price.
4. The program handles the two cases separately:
   - If `b <= a`, it prints `a * n`, which means all buns are sold at the usual price.
   - If `b > a`, it uses the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` to calculate the total profit. This formula accounts for the reduced price of the first `k` buns and the usual price of the remaining buns.
5. The logic for determining the maximum profit is sound and matches the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
