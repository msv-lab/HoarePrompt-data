### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`, which means `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the modified price and the usual price.
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, so it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Hence, the profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit calculation is:
     - `b * k` for the first `k` buns.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` to account for the decreasing sequence sum (arithmetic series sum formula for the first `k` natural numbers).
     - `(n - k) * a` for the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the boundary condition when `b <= a`.
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is used correctly to calculate the total profit for the first `k` buns.
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price, which is handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `b <= a`, the solution correctly prints `a * n`.
   - When `b > a`, the solution correctly calculates the profit using the arithmetic series sum formula and the usual price for the remaining buns.

### Detailed Verification Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `t` is the number of test cases.
  - Each test case consists of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

- **First Iteration:**
  - Read `n`, `a`, and `b` for the current test case.
  - Calculate `k` as `min(n, b - a)`.
  - If `b <= a`, print `a * n`.
  - Otherwise, print `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a`.

- **Arithmetic Series Sum Calculation:**
  - The term `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2` correctly calculates the sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` buns with prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.
  - The term `(n - k) * a` correctly calculates the profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

### Conclusion:

- The provided solution correctly handles all edge cases and the general case.
- The logic is sound and matches the problem description.
- The arithmetic series sum formula is applied correctly.
