Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `b` is less than or equal to `a` correctly. According to the problem description, if `b` is less than or equal to `a`, Bob should sell all buns at the usual price `a`. However, the program calculates the profit using the formula `b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a` even when `b <= a`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
3 4 3
```
The expected output is `12` because Bob should sell all buns at the usual price of 4 coins each. However, the program incorrectly calculates the profit as `3 * 3 - 3 * 2 // 2 + (3 - 3) * 4 = 9 - 3 + 0 = 6`.

To fix this, the program should check if `b <= a` and print `a * n` in that case. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
```

This ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly.
