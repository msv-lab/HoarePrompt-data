Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing three integers (`n`, `a`, and `b`). It does not take any parameters itself but processes the data provided through these test cases and returns a result for each one.
