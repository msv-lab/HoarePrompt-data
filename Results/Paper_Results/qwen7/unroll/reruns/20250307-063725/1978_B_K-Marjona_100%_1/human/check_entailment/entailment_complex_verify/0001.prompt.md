You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        k = min(n, b - a)
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        k = min(n, b - a)
        
        if b <= a:
            print(a * n)
        else:
            print(b * k - k * (k - 1) // 2 + (n - k) * a)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of one test case's computation. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output will be \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output will be \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).
    #
    #This means for each test case, the output will either be a simple multiplication of \( a \) and \( n \) or a more complex expression involving \( b \), \( a \), and \( n \), depending on the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases, where each test case includes three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a result based on the values of \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). If \( b \leq a \), the result is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the result is \( b \times k - \frac{k \times (k - 1)}{2} + (n - k) \times a \), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \). After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize Bob's profit by choosing an optimal `k` (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at prices `(b - i + 1)` for `i` from `1` to `k`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution calculates `k` as `min(n, b - a)`, which means `k` is the minimum of `n` and `b - a`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the number of buns or the difference between the modified price and the usual price.
   - If `b <= a`, it means the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, so it's better to sell all buns at the usual price `a`. Hence, the profit is `a * n`.
   - Otherwise, the profit calculation is:
     - `b * k` for the first `k` buns.
     - `- k * (k - 1) // 2` to account for the decreasing sequence sum (arithmetic series sum formula for the first `k` natural numbers).
     - `(n - k) * a` for the remaining `(n - k)` buns at the usual price `a`.

3. **Verification:**
   - The logic correctly handles the boundary condition when `b <= a`.
   - The arithmetic series sum formula is used correctly to calculate the total profit for the first `k` buns.
   - The remaining buns are sold at the usual price, which is handled correctly.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `b <= a`, the solution correctly prints `a * n`.
   - When `b > a`, the solution correctly calculates the profit using the arithmetic series sum formula and the usual price for the remaining buns.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize Bob's profit.
