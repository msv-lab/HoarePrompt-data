### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

#### Step 1: Input Parsing
The program correctly parses the input and initializes variables `n` and `x`.

#### Step 2: Check for Even Sum
The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If `y % 2 != 0`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct because the settling pattern requires `n + x` to be even.

#### Step 3: Function `func_1`
The function `func_1` is supposed to find valid values of `k` based on the given `q` and `x`. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed. Here's why:

- **Condition Check**: The condition `w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1` is incorrect. It checks if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. This condition is not relevant to finding valid `k` values.
- **Divisor Calculation**: The function iterates through possible divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet certain conditions. However, the conditions `i >= x - 1` and `q // i >= x - 1` are not directly related to the problem's requirements.

#### Step 4: Main Logic
The main logic in the program uses `func_1` with incorrect parameters and does not correctly derive the valid values of `k`. Specifically:
- `L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. The parameters passed to `func_1` do not accurately represent the valid values of `k`.

#### Step 5: Output
The program prints the length of the set `L1`, which is supposed to contain the valid values of `k`. However, due to the flawed logic in `func_1`, the output is incorrect.

#### Example Case Analysis
Let's consider the test case `100 99`:
- `y = 100 + 99 = 199` (odd, so print `0` and continue)
- This case is incorrectly handled by the program, as it should return `0` instead of `1` (since `k = 2` is a valid solution).

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` and the main logic are flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the valid values of `k`.
