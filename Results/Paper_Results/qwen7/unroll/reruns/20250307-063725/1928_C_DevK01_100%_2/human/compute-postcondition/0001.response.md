Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is an empty list, `w` is the square root of `q`.**

In this state, the variable `w` is assigned the value of the square root of `q`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
