Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing `w`, `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The code `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is defined as the square root of `q` and is an integer, it remains unchanged. The value of `x` and `q` also remain unchanged. Therefore, `M` now contains the value of `w`.
