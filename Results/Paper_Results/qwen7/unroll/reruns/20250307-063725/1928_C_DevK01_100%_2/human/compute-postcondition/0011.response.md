Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q). The function returns a list `M` that contains all divisors of `q` which are greater than or equal to `x-1` and less than or equal to `q/(x-1)`**.
