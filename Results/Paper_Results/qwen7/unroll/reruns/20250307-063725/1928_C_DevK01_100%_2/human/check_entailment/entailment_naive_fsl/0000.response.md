Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic for determining the valid values of `k` is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find valid values of `k`, but its implementation is incorrect. It checks if certain conditions are met but does not correctly map those conditions to the valid values of `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Validating `k`:**
   - The main logic in the program does not correctly validate the values of `k`. For instance, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y % 2 == 0`. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine the valid values of `k`.
   - The program also attempts to call `func_1` with parameters that do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. For example, `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` do not correctly derive the valid values of `k`.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case `100 99`. According to the problem description, the valid values of `k` should be those that satisfy the settling pattern. However, the program incorrectly returns `0` for this case, indicating that no valid `k` is found, which is incorrect since `k = 2` would be a valid solution.

To fix the program, the logic needs to correctly identify the valid values of `k` based on the given position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received. The correct approach involves understanding the repeating pattern of the settling and determining the valid `k` values accordingly.
