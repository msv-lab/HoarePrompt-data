Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) such that Vasya's position and the number he received during the "first-k-th" settling process match the given conditions.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of \( q \) that satisfy certain conditions related to \( x \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - If \( y \) is odd, it prints 0 and continues to the next test case.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with specific arguments and processes the result.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It finds all divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x-1 \) and less than or equal to \( q/(x-1) \).
   - This function correctly identifies potential values of \( k \) based on the divisor conditions.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where \( n \geq 3x - 2 \) by adding another call to `func_1`.
   - This ensures that all possible values of \( k \) are considered.

6. **Set Conversion**:
   - Converting the list to a set before calculating its length ensures that only unique values of \( k \) are counted.

Given the detailed analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` accurately identifies the divisors, and the main loop processes the results appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
