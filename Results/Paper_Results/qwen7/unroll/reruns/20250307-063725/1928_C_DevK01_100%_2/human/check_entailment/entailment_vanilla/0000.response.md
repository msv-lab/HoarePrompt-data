Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct because `y` must be even for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct in terms of finding divisors, but there are some issues with the implementation:
     - The condition `if w == w // 1` is unnecessary and redundant.
     - The loop should ensure that both `i` and `q // i` are checked for being greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the number of valid `k` values using the results from `func_1`.
   - The logic to add elements to `L1` and convert the list to a set to remove duplicates is correct.
   - However, the final count of unique `k` values is printed, which is correct.

### Detailed Issues:
- The function `func_1` has an unnecessary check `if w == w // 1`, which can be removed.
- The loop in `func_1` should ensure that both `i` and `q // i` are checked properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = int(math.sqrt(q))
    if w * w == q and w >= x - 1:
        M.append(w)
    i = 1
    while i <= w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.append(i)
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M.append(q // i)
        i += 1
    return M
```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, the main logic is correct, but there are minor issues in the implementation of `func_1`. However, these issues do not affect the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and will produce the right output given the constraints and examples provided.
