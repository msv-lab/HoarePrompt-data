Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that a given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, with the first \( k \) positions being numbered from 1 to \( k \), the next \( k - 2 \) positions being numbered from \( k - 1 \) to 2, and so on.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern implies that the number \( x \) Vasya received corresponds to a specific segment of the repeating pattern.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to the divisors of \( q = n + x - 2 \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function calculates the divisors of \( q = (n + x - 2) \) that are within the range \([x-1, \frac{q}{x-1}]\).
   - These divisors represent potential values of \( k \) because they determine the segments of the settling pattern that could contain the given \( x \).

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if it is even. If not, there are no valid \( k \), and it prints 0.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with \( q = (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - Depending on the position \( n \), it may add more divisors to the result.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the resulting list of divisors.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the divisors of \( q \) within the specified range.
   - The main program correctly handles the input and applies the logic to find the valid \( k \) values.
   - The conditions and calculations align with the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
