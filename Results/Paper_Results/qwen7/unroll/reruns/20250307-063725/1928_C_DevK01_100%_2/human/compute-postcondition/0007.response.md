Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `w`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop condition is `i < w`. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be less than `w`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9).
   - `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q).
   - `M` is a list containing `w`, where `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer.

4. **Condition Analysis**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` (which is 1) must be less than `w`.

5. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `i` is fixed at 1, the only variable that can be adjusted is `w`.
   - To ensure `i < w`, `w` must be greater than 1.

6. **Final State**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `w` must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the final state right before the loop should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `w` must be greater than 1**
