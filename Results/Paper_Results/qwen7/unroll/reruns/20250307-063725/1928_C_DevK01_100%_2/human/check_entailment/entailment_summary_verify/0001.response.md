### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identified the main logic of the program as correct and pointed out some minor issues in the implementation of the `func_1` function. Let's review the key points and verify the correctness:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct because `y` must be even for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is fundamentally correct, but there are some unnecessary and redundant checks:
     - The condition `if w == w // 1` is indeed redundant and can be removed.
     - The loop should ensure that both `i` and `q // i` are checked properly for being greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the number of valid `k` values using the results from `func_1`.
   - The logic to add elements to `L1` and convert the list to a set to remove duplicates is correct.
   - The final count of unique `k` values is printed, which is correct.

### Detailed Issues:
- The function `func_1` has an unnecessary check `if w == w // 1`, which can be removed.
- The loop in `func_1` should ensure that both `i` and `q // i` are checked properly for being greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = int(math.sqrt(q))
    if w * w == q and w >= x - 1:
        M.append(w)
    i = 1
    while i <= w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.append(i)
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M.append(q // i)
        i += 1
    return M
```

### Verification:
Given the corrections and the original logic, the program will still produce the correct output. The main logic remains intact, and the minor adjustments in `func_1` do not affect the overall correctness.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The program is logically correct and will produce the right output given the constraints and examples provided.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
