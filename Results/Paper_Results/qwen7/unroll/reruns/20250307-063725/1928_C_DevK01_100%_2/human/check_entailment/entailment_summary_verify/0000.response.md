### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function `func_1`:
The function `func_1` is supposed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x-1` and less than or equal to `q/(x-1)`. This part of the function is implemented correctly and serves the purpose of finding potential values of `k`.

#### Main Program Logic:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x` from the input.

2. **Initial Check:**
   - The program calculates `y = n + x`.
   - It checks if `y % 2 == 0`. If `y` is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the settling pattern requires even `y`.

3. **Calling `func_1`:**
   - The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and stores the result in `L1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` and adds the result to `L1`.

4. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The program converts `L1` to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the length of the set, which represents the number of valid `k` values.

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is called with `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` as arguments. These values do not directly correspond to the valid `k` values. The correct approach should involve understanding the periodicity of the settling pattern.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Validating `k`:**
   - The logic for determining the valid `k` values is flawed. The program does not correctly map the conditions to the valid `k` values. Specifically, the conditions `n >= 3 * x - 2` and the way `func_1` is called do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - For the test case `100 99`, the program incorrectly returns `0` because it does not correctly identify the valid `k` values. The correct value of `k` should be `2`, but the program fails to recognize this.

#### Correct Approach:
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to understand the periodicity of the settling pattern. The settling pattern repeats every `2k - 2` positions. We need to find the number of `k` values that fit the given constraints.
- The correct logic involves calculating the number of complete cycles within `n` and checking the remaining positions to determine the valid `k` values.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
