Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given \( n \) and \( x \). The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions, and the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) are given.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern can be broken down into segments of length \( k \) and \( k-2 \).
   - The value of \( k \) must satisfy certain conditions derived from the position \( n \) and the number \( x \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the divisors of \( q \) that are within specific ranges.
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it meets the condition.
   - It iterates through potential divisors and adds them to the list if they meet the criteria.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes each test case.
   - It calculates \( y = n + x \) and checks if \( y \) is even.
   - If \( y \) is even, it calls `func_1` with appropriate parameters.
   - It ensures that the final result is unique by converting the list to a set before calculating its length.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The constraints \( 1 \leq x < n \leq 10^9 \) and \( 1 \leq x < q \) are handled correctly.
   - The logic for checking divisors and ensuring the correct range is implemented accurately.

6. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples and the annotated program state confirm that the logic is correctly applied.
   - The function `func_1` and the main program logic align with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of possible \( k \) values for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
