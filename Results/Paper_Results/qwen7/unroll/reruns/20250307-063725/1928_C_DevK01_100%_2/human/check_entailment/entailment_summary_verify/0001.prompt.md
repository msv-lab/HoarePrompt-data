You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q). The function returns a list `M` that contains all divisors of `q` which are greater than or equal to `x-1` and less than or equal to `q/(x-1)`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` and `x`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - The program checks if `y = n + x` is even. If it is odd, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct because `y` must be even for the settling pattern to repeat correctly.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is used to find all divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is correct in terms of finding divisors, but there are some issues with the implementation:
     - The condition `if w == w // 1` is unnecessary and redundant.
     - The loop should ensure that both `i` and `q // i` are checked for being greater than or equal to `x - 1`.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic calculates the number of valid `k` values using the results from `func_1`.
   - The logic to add elements to `L1` and convert the list to a set to remove duplicates is correct.
   - However, the final count of unique `k` values is printed, which is correct.

### Detailed Issues:
- The function `func_1` has an unnecessary check `if w == w // 1`, which can be removed.
- The loop in `func_1` should ensure that both `i` and `q // i` are checked properly.

### Corrected Version:
Here is a corrected version of the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = int(math.sqrt(q))
    if w * w == q and w >= x - 1:
        M.append(w)
    i = 1
    while i <= w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M.append(i)
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M.append(q // i)
        i += 1
    return M
```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, the main logic is correct, but there are minor issues in the implementation of `func_1`. However, these issues do not affect the overall correctness of the program.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

The program is logically correct and will produce the right output given the constraints and examples provided.
