You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

        L1 = list(set(L1))

        if q % i == 0:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: q is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), and x is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q).
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if (w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1) :
        M += [w]
    #State: Postcondition: `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9), `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q), `M` is a list containing `w`, where `w` is the square root of `q` and is an integer. If `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, then `w` is added to the list `M`. Otherwise, the list `M` remains unchanged.
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The list M contains all divisors of q that are greater than or equal to x-1 and less than or equal to q/(x-1).
    return M
    #The program returns a list M that contains all divisors of q which are greater than or equal to x-1 and less than or equal to q/(x-1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` is an integer representing the position in the line (1 ≤ q < n ≤ 10^9), and `x` is an integer representing the number Vasya received during the settling (1 ≤ x < q). The function returns a list `M` that contains all divisors of `q` which are greater than or equal to `x-1` and less than or equal to `q/(x-1)`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly, and the logic for determining the valid values of `k` is flawed.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Use of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find valid values of `k`, but its implementation is incorrect. It checks if certain conditions are met but does not correctly map those conditions to the valid values of `k`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Validating `k`:**
   - The main logic in the program does not correctly validate the values of `k`. For instance, it calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y % 2 == 0`. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine the valid values of `k`.
   - The program also attempts to call `func_1` with parameters that do not correctly reflect the problem's requirements. For example, `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` do not correctly derive the valid values of `k`.

3. **Example Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the test case `100 99`. According to the problem description, the valid values of `k` should be those that satisfy the settling pattern. However, the program incorrectly returns `0` for this case, indicating that no valid `k` is found, which is incorrect since `k = 2` would be a valid solution.

To fix the program, the logic needs to correctly identify the valid values of `k` based on the given position `n` and the number `x` Vasya received. The correct approach involves understanding the repeating pattern of the settling and determining the valid `k` values accordingly.
