Output State: **The output consists of `func_10()` lines, each containing a string generated by `func_15()`. The exact content of these strings depends on the implementation of `func_15()`.**

This means that the loop will execute `func_10()` times, and each time it writes a line to the standard output using the result of `func_15()`. The number of lines and their content are determined by the functions `func_10()` and `func_15()`, respectively.
