### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that all functions work together to solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the problem and the functions step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: We need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that:
   - \(1 \le a \le n\)
   - \(1 \le b \le m\)
   - \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_2()`: Reads a line of input, splits it into integers, and returns a map object.
   - `func_3()`: Similar to `func_2()`, but returns a list.
   - `func_4()`: Calls `func_3()` `rows_number` times.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line from standard input and returns it.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a line from standard input, strips trailing whitespace, decodes it from bytes to string, and returns the result.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into integers, and returns a list.
   - `func_8()`: Calls `func_7()` `rows` times.
   - `func_9()`: Reads an input string from standard input.
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from standard input.
   - `func_11()`: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into strings, and returns a list.
   - `func_12()`: A recursive function that seems to be related to graph traversal.
   - `func_13()`: Implements the extended Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_14()`: Adjusts a list of integers to ensure they meet certain criteria.
   - `func_15()`: Calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), where \(i * i \leq n + i\).
   - `func_16()`: Processes test cases and prints the result of `func_15()` for each test case.

3. **Analysis of `func_15()`**:
   - `func_15()` calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), where \(i * i \leq n + i\).
   - This function directly addresses part of the problem by iterating over possible values of \(i\) and computing the required sum.

4. **Analysis of `func_16()`**:
   - `func_16()` processes test cases by reading the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\) and prints the result of `func_15()` for each pair.
   - This function ensures that the program handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

5. **Overall Program Flow**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and for each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then calls `func_15()` to compute the required value and prints it.
   - All necessary functions are used correctly to process the input and produce the expected output.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and uses the provided functions appropriately.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
