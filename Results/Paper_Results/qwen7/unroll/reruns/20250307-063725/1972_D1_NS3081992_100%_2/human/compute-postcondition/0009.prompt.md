You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are positive integers such that 0 <= n <= len(a) and 1 <= m <= max(a), and k is an integer representing the remaining value that needs to be non-negative after the operations described in the function.
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] that was less than m has been increased to at least m, k is the initial value of k minus the total difference between each a[i] (that was less than m) and m.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] that was less than m has been increased to at least m, k is the initial value of k plus the total difference between each a[i] (that was less than m) and m, and k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m` where 0 <= n <= len(a) and 1 <= m <= max(a), and an integer `k`. It returns 1 if it's possible to perform operations such that the remaining value of `k` is non-negative. Otherwise, it returns -1.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 1

Case_2: The program returns -1


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
