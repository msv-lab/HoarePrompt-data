### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.), but these functions are not used in the main logic.
   - The core logic is implemented in `func_15` and `func_16`.
   - `func_15` is intended to solve the problem, but its implementation does not correctly address the problem statement.
   - `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, printing the result.

3. **Analysis of `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` attempts to count the number of valid pairs using a specific formula.
   - It iterates from 1 to \(m\) and checks if \(i^2\) divides \(n + i\).
   - This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - A more accurate approach would involve iterating through all pairs and checking the condition directly.

5. **Detailed Analysis of `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` is supposed to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for given \(n\) and \(m\).
   - The logic in `func_15` is flawed because it does not correctly implement the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Specifically, the function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and checks if \(i^2\) divides \(n + i\), which is not relevant to the problem's requirement.

6. **Annotated Code Validation**:
   - The annotated code provides insights into the functions' behaviors.
   - `func_15` is indeed not solving the problem correctly. It does not iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the required condition.
   - The logic in `func_15` is based on a misunderstanding of the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
- The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The logic in `func_15` is flawed and does not meet the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate. The given program is incorrect because the function `func_15` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.
