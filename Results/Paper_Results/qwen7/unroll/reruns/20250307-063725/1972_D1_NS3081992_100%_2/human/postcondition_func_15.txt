The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it writes `func_10()` lines of output to the standard output, where each line contains a string generated by `func_15()`. The exact content of these strings depends on the implementation of `func_15()`.
