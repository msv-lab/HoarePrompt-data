Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_16()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    return int(sys.stdin.buffer.readline())
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1()` reads an integer from standard input (stdin) and returns it. The function accepts no parameters and its sole action is to retrieve and return an integer value provided by the user through stdin.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    return map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split())
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function reads integers from the standard input, splits them based on spaces, and returns a map object containing these integers. This operation is performed without requiring any input parameters.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    return list(map(int, sys.stdin.buffer.readline().split()))
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into individual integers based on spaces, and returns these integers as a list.
Function number 4 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_4(rows_number):
    return [func_3() for _ in range(rows_number)]
''' 

 Output hints for function4:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `rows_number` as input and returns a list. This list contains the result of calling another function `func_3()` exactly `rows_number` times.
Function number 5 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_5():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip()
''' 

 Output hints for function5:  The function reads a single line from the standard input buffer, removes any trailing whitespace, and returns the line. This action is performed without requiring any input parameters.
Function number 6 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_6():
    return sys.stdin.buffer.readline().rstrip().decode()
''' 

 Output hints for function6:  The function reads a line from standard input, removes any trailing whitespace, converts it from bytes to a string, and returns the resulting string.
Function number 7 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    return [int(i) for i in input().split()]
''' 

 Output hints for function7:  The function reads a single input string, splits it into individual elements based on spaces, converts each element to an integer, and returns a list of these integers.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_8(rows):
    return [func_7() for _ in range(rows)]
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function `func_8` accepts a non-negative integer `rows` and generates a list containing the results of calling `func_7()` for each row in the range from 0 to `rows-1`. The final state of the program is a list of results returned by `func_7()`.
Function number 9 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_9():
    return input()
''' 

 Output hints for function9:  The function accepts no parameters and returns an input string provided by the user.
Function number 10 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_10():
    return int(input())
''' 

 Output hints for function10:  The function `func_10` accepts no parameters and reads an integer input from the standard input stream, returning this integer value.
Function number 11 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_11():
    return input().split()
''' 

 Output hints for function11:  The function reads input data consisting of multiple test cases, where each test case contains two integers `n` and `m`. It splits the input string for each test case into a list of strings containing the values of `n` and `m`, and returns this list.
Function number 12 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_12(d, processing, da, rank):
    tmp = 10 ** 9
    if len(d[da]) == 1:
        return 1
    for di in d[da]:
        if processing[di - 1] == 0:
            processing[di - 1] = 1
            tmp = min(tmp, func_12(d, processing, di, rank))
            processing[di - 1] = 0
    rank[da - 1] = tmp + 1
    return tmp + 1
''' 

 Output hints for function12:  The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating whether nodes have been processed, an integer `da` as a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to zeros. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it processes nodes recursively, updates the `processing` list, and calculates the minimum value among all the values that `tmp` was set to during the loop executions. Finally, it assigns this minimum value plus one to the corresponding position in the `rank` list and returns this value.
Function number 13 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_13(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return (x, y, a)
    (x, y, g) = func_13(b, a % b)
    return (y, x - a // b * y, g)
''' 

 Output hints for function13:  The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns the results of that call, specifically `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. The function ultimately aims to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm.
Function number 14 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_14(a, n, m, k):
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < m:
            k -= m - a[i]
    if k >= 0:
        return 1
    return -1
''' 

 Output hints for function14:  The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It increases each element `a[i]` that is less than `m` to at least `m`, adjusting the value of `k` accordingly. If after these adjustments, the value of `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1.
Function number 15 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
''' 

 Output hints for function15:  The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), where \(i * i \leq n + i\), and then subtracts 1 from the result.
Function number 16 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
''' 

 Output hints for function16:  The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it writes `func_10()` lines of output to the standard output, where each line contains a string generated by `func_15()`. The exact content of these strings depends on the implementation of `func_15()`.
