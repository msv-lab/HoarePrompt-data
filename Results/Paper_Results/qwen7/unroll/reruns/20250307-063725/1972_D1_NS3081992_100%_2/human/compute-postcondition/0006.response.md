Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to m, where i * i does not exceed n + i, and then subtracts 1 from the result.**

This means the function `func_15` accepts no parameters directly but works with the predefined values of `n` and `m` within the given constraints. It computes the sum of the expression `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` from 1 to `m` (inclusive), but only if `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`. Finally, it returns this sum after subtracting 1 from it.
