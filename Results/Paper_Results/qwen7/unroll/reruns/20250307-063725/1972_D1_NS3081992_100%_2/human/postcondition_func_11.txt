The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating whether nodes have been processed, an integer `da` as a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to zeros. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it processes nodes recursively, updates the `processing` list, and calculates the minimum value among all the values that `tmp` was set to during the loop executions. Finally, it assigns this minimum value plus one to the corresponding position in the `rank` list and returns this value.
