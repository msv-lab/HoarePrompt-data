Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(func_10()):`. The only object involved here is `func_10()`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer (since `range` function in Python requires a non-negative integer).

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed**: Since the loop depends on the return value of `func_10()`, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\). However, these values (`n` and `m`) are not directly used in the loop condition but are part of the context.

4. **Adjust the state**: The key state to adjust is the return value of `func_10()`. We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer, which means the loop will execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`.

**State:**
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Since the loop depends solely on the return value of `func_10()`, and there are no other variables or states directly influencing the loop execution, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**.
