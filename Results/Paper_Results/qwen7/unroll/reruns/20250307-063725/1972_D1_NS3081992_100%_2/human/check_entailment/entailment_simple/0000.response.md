Reasoning:
1. **Function Definitions**: The functions defined in the annotated program seem to be designed to handle various aspects of reading input and processing it according to the problem's requirements.
2. **Main Function Call**: The main function call `func_16()` is responsible for iterating over the number of test cases (`t`) and printing the result of `func_15()` for each test case.
3. **Function `func_15()`**: This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for the given constraints. It iterates over possible values of \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) and sums up the expression \((n + i) // (i * i)\) as long as \(i * i \leq n + i\). This logic appears to be relevant to the problem since it involves checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. **Input Handling**: Functions like `func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, etc., are designed to read input in different ways (e.g., single integer, map of integers, list of integers, etc.). These functions are correctly handling the input as per the problem statement.
5. **Overall Logic**: The overall logic of the program seems to be correctly implemented to solve the problem. The function `func_15()` is correctly calculating the number of valid pairs for each test case, and the main function `func_16()` is correctly iterating over the test cases and printing the results.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
