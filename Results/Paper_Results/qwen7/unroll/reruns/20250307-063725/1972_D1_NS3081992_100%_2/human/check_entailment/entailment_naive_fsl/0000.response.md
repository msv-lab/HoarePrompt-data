Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem description asks for the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any logic to solve this specific problem. Instead, they include various utility functions that do not address the core requirement. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case and is thus incorrect.
