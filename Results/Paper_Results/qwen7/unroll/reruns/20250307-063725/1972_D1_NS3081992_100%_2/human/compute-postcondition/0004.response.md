Output State: **The value of `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, as long as `i * i <= n + i`.**

To break this down further:
- The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
- In each iteration, the value of `ans` is incremented by `(n + i) // (i * i)`.
- The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `m` and `i * i` is less than or equal to `n + i`.
- Once `i` exceeds `m` or `i * i` exceeds `n + i`, the loop terminates.
- The final value of `ans` is the sum of all these increments.
