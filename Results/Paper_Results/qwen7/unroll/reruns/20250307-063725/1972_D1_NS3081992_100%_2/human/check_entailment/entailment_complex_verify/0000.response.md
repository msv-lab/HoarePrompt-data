### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the problem description to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description Recap:
Given two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \), calculate the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \( 1 \leq a \leq n \)
2. \( 1 \leq b \leq m \)
3. \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \)

#### Provided Functions:
1. **Function 1**: Reads an integer from standard input.
2. **Function 2**: Reads multiple integers from standard input, split by spaces.
3. **Function 3**: Reads multiple integers from standard input, split by spaces, and returns them as a list.
4. **Function 4**: Generates a list of lists by calling `func_3` multiple times.
5. **Function 5**: Reads a single line from standard input, stripped of trailing whitespace.
6. **Function 6**: Reads a single line from standard input, stripped of trailing whitespace, and decodes it from bytes to string.
7. **Function 7**: Reads a single line of input, splits it into integers, and returns them as a list.
8. **Function 8**: Generates a list of lists by calling `func_7` multiple times.
9. **Function 9**: Reads an input string from standard input.
10. **Function 10**: Reads an integer from standard input.
11. **Function 11**: Reads a line of input, splits it into strings, and returns them as a list.
12. **Function 12**: Recursive function involving graph traversal.
13. **Function 13**: Extended Euclidean algorithm.
14. **Function 14**: Adjusts a list of integers based on a threshold and checks a condition.
15. **Function 15**: Computes a specific mathematical expression and returns the result.
16. **Function 16**: Processes test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case.

#### Key Observations:
- **Function 15** is the only function that attempts to solve the problem. It computes the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all \(i\) from 1 to \(m\) where \(i * i \leq n + i\), and then subtracts 1 from the result.
- **Function 16** processes the test cases by calling `func_15` for each test case and prints the result.

However, Function 15 does not correctly solve the problem. The condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is not addressed in Function 15. Instead, it computes a different mathematical expression.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the required functionality. While Function 15 computes a value, it does not solve the problem as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
