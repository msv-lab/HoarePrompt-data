Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` indicating whether nodes have been processed, an integer `da` as a key in the dictionary `d`, and a list `rank` initialized to zeros. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise, it processes nodes recursively, updates the `processing` list, and calculates the minimum value among all the values that `tmp` was set to during the loop executions. Finally, it assigns this minimum value plus one to the corresponding position in the `rank` list and returns this value.

#Function 13:

    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, and g, where y, x, and g are the results of the function call `func_13(b, a % b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both positive integers. If `b` is zero, it returns `(1, 0, a)`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns the results of that call, specifically `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`. The function ultimately aims to compute values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the extended Euclidean algorithm.

#Function 14:

    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] that was less than m has been increased to at least m, k is the initial value of k plus the total difference between each a[i] (that was less than m) and m, and k is less than 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It increases each element `a[i]` that is less than `m` to at least `m`, adjusting the value of `k` accordingly. If after these adjustments, the value of `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and the square of i does not exceed n + i for i up to m.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i <= m and i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The value of `ans` is the sum of `(n + i) // (i * i)` for all `i` from 1 to `m`, as long as `i * i <= n + i`.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns the sum of (n + i) // (i * i) for all i from 1 to m, as long as i * i <= n + i, minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the sum of \((n + i) // (i * i)\) for all integers \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), where \(i * i \leq n + i\), and then subtracts 1 from the result.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: The output consists of `func_10()` lines, each containing a string generated by `func_15()`. The exact content of these strings depends on the implementation of `func_15()`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it writes `func_10()` lines of output to the standard output, where each line contains a string generated by `func_15()`. The exact content of these strings depends on the implementation of `func_15()`.
