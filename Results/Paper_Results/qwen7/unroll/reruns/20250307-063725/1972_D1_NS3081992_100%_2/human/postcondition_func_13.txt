The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two positive integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It increases each element `a[i]` that is less than `m` to at least `m`, adjusting the value of `k` accordingly. If after these adjustments, the value of `k` is non-negative, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it returns -1.
