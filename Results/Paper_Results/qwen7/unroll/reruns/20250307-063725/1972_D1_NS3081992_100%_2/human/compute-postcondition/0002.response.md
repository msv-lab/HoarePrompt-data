Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and m.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each starting with an integer t indicating the number of subsequent pairs of integers (n, m) to process. The function does not return a single value but processes each test case individually, returning different outputs based on the values of n and m within each test case.
