Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze if the provided functions collectively solve the problem correctly. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**: The problem requires reading multiple test cases, each containing two integers \( n \) and \( m \). The functions `func_10()` and `func_7()` are suitable for reading integers and space-separated integers, respectively. However, since the problem specifies reading from standard input, `func_10()` and `func_7()` should be used appropriately.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**: The function `func_15()` is designed to process a single test case. It calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. This function seems to be correctly implemented for the problem statement.

3. **Main Function**: The function `func_16()` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases using `func_10()` and then processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and writing the result to the standard output using `sys.stdout.write`.

Given the problem requirements and the provided functions:
- `func_10()` and `func_7()` are used correctly to read input.
- `func_15()` is correctly implemented to solve the problem for a single test case.
- `func_16()` correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and calling `func_15()` for each.

Since all the functions together correctly handle the input, process each test case according to the problem statement, and produce the expected output, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
