Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of a binary string), and a binary string \( a \). For each test case, it finds and prints the position \( pos \) in the binary string that minimizes the distance to the center of the array while ensuring that the number of '1's on the right side is at least half of the total '1's and the number of '0's on the left side is at least half of the total '0's. If no such position exists, it prints the position that minimizes the distance to the center without the count constraints.**
