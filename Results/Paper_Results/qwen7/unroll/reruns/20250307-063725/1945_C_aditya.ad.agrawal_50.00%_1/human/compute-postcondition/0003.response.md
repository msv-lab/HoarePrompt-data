Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, where each integer represents the position `pos` that minimizes the distance to the center of the array while satisfying the conditions on the counts of '0's and '1's in the left and right parts of the array.

Explanation: For each test case, the loop calculates the position `pos` in the binary string `arr` that meets the criteria of having at least half of the '1's on the right side and at least half of the '0's on the left side, with the additional condition that this position is closest to the center of the array. The loop then prints this position for each test case.
