Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. It returns a value based on the sum of n over all test cases.**

This means the function is designed to process multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters t, n, and a string a. The function does not take these parameters directly but works with them indirectly through the test cases. The function's output is based on summarizing the value of n across all test cases.
