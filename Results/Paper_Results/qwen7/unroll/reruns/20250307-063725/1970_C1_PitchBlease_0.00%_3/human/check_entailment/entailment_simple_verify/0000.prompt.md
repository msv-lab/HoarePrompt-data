You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is the easy version of the problem. The difference in this version is
that t=1 and we work on an array-like tree.

Ron and Hermione are playing a game on a tree of n nodes that are initially
inactive. This tree is special because it has exactly two leaves. It can thus
be seen as an array. The game consists of t rounds, each of which starts with
a stone on exactly one node, which is considered as activated. A move consists
of picking an inactive neighbor of the node with a stone on it and moving the
stone there (thus activating this neighbor). Ron makes the first move, after
which he alternates with Hermione until no valid move is available. The player
that cannot make a move loses the round. If both players play optimally, who
wins each round of this game?

Note that all the rounds are played with the same tree; only the starting node
changes. Moreover, after each round, all active nodes are considered inactive
again.

Input

The first line contains integers n (2 \leq n \leq 2\times 10^5 ), t (t=1 ),
the number of nodes in the tree and the number of rounds, respectively.

The next n-1 lines contain two integers 1 \leq u, v \leq n each, corresponding
to an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that the tree has exactly two leaves.

The next line contains t integers 1 \leq u_1 , \dots, u_t \leq n ,
corresponding to the node where the stone is initially put.

Output

The output consists of t=1 line which is either "Ron" or "Hermione".

The `start` integer representing the starting node for the first round remains unchanged.

        current, dist = queue.popleft()

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the program calculates the distance from the starting node to each leaf and determines the winner based on whether these distances are even or odd. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal moves that Ron and Hermione would make during the game.

To correctly determine the winner, the program needs to simulate the game and check if the starting node is in a winning position. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
4 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
3
```

In this case, the tree looks like this:
```
    1
     \
      2
     /
    3
   /
  4
```

If the stone starts at node 3, Ron can move it to node 2. Then Hermione can move it to node 1. Finally, Ron can move it to node 4, and Hermione cannot make a move. Therefore, Hermione wins.

However, the provided program incorrectly determines that Ron wins because the distance from node 3 to the leaves (1 and 4) is 2 (even), so it returns "Ron". This is incorrect based on the optimal strategy.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is therefore incorrect.
