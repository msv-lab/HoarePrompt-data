Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game played on a special tree structure with exactly two leaves. The game is played optimally by both players, Ron and Hermione, and the outcome depends on the parity (even or odd) of the shortest distances from the starting node to the two leaves.
2. `func_1` correctly constructs the tree and identifies the two leaves. It then calls `bfs` to calculate the shortest distances from the starting node to each of the two leaves.
3. The logic in `func_1` is sound:
   - If either of the distances is even, Ron wins because he can always force a win by making optimal moves.
   - If both distances are odd, Hermione wins because she can always force a win by making optimal moves.
4. The `bfs` function correctly implements the Breadth-First Search algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in the tree. It returns the correct distance if the target node is reachable and -1 otherwise.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided functions correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
