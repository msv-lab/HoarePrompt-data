The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. 

- `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree.
- `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and its length is `n-1`.
- `start` is an integer representing the starting node for the first round.

The tree has exactly two leaves. Based on the starting node and the structure of the tree, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`, and return either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on the given conditions.
