The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `queue` being non-empty.

Right before the loop, the `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`. For the loop to execute the first time, the `queue` must be non-empty.

Since the `queue` is already non-empty (it contains at least one element), no adjustments are necessary.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, and `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
