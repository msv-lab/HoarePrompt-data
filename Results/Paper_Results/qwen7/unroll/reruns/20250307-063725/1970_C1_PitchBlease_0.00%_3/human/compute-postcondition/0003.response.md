Output State: **The function returns the shortest distance from the start node to the target node, or None if the target node is not reachable.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the function will either return the shortest distance found from the start node to the target node (if the target node is reachable), or it will return `None` if the target node is not reachable within the graph/tree structure. The `queue` will be empty, and the `visited` set will contain all nodes that were visited during the search, including the start node and any nodes along the shortest path to the target node (if it exists).
