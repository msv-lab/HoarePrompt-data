Output State: **`dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS, `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all nodes connected based on the given edges; `n` remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one adjacent node; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS.**

In this output state, the variable `dist2` is updated to be the distance from the starting node (`start`) to the second leaf node (`leaves[1]`) calculated using BFS (Breadth-First Search). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
