Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves a game played on a tree structure with exactly two leaves. The game is played for a single round, and the winner is determined based on the parity of the shortest distances from the starting node to the two leaves.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**:
     - Constructs the tree using the given edges.
     - Identifies the two leaves of the tree.
     - Uses BFS to calculate the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf.
     - Determines the winner based on the parity of these distances.
   - **bfs**:
     - Implements a standard BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node.
     - Returns the distance if the target node is reachable, otherwise returns -1.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Edge Case Handling**: The problem guarantees that the tree has exactly two leaves, so the identification of leaves is straightforward.
   - **Distance Calculation**: BFS correctly calculates the shortest distance from the start node to any other node in the tree.
   - **Winner Determination**: The logic for determining the winner based on the parity of the distances is correct. If either distance is even, Ron wins; otherwise, Hermione wins.
   - **Input/Output**: The function `func_1` correctly processes the input, calls the BFS function, and outputs the result as required.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
