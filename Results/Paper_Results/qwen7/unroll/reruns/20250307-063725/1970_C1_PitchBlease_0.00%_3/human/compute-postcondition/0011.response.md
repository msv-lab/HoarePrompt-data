Postcondition: `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS, `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, with all nodes connected based on the given edges; `n` remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree; `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree; `leaves` is a list of nodes that have only one adjacent node; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS; `(dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0)` is false.
