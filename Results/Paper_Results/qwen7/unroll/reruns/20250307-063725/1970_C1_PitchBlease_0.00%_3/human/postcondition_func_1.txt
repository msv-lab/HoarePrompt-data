The function `bfs` accepts two parameters, `start` and `target`, both integers representing nodes in a tree. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the `start` node to the `target` node. If the `target` node is reachable, it returns the shortest distance; otherwise, it returns -1 indicating the `target` node is not reachable from the `start` node.
