The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `edges`, and `start`. `n` is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, `edges` is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and `start` is an integer representing the starting node for the first round. The tree has exactly two leaves, and the length of `edges` is `n-1`.

The function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n`, a list of tuples `edges`, and an integer `start`, and based on the structure of the tree and the starting node, it returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
