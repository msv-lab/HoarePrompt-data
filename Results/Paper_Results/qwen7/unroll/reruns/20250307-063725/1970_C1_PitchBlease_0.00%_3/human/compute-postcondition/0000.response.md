Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, and `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree.**

Explanation: The code initializes a queue using collections.deque with a single element, which is a tuple containing the starting node (`start`) and a distance of 0. The values of `start` and `target` remain unchanged.
