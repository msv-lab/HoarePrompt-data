Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in the tree, a list of tuples `edges` representing the edges of the tree, and an integer `start` representing the starting node for the first round. It constructs a tree representation using the provided edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using Breadth-First Search (BFS). Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.**
