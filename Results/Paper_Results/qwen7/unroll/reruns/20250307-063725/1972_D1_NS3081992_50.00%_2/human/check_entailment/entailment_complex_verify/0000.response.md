### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required functionality for the problem. Let's break down the issues and verify the original assessment:

1. **Problem Description**: The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - Most of the functions (`func_1` to `func_15`) are utility functions that do not relate to the core problem of counting valid pairs.
   - `func_16` is the main function that processes the test cases but does not contain the logic to solve the problem.

3. **Core Logic Missing**:
   - There is no function that iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - The function `func_15` does not perform the necessary calculations for the problem and instead returns a constant value `-1`.

4. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - `func_15` calculates a value based on the input `n` and `m` but does not use these values to count valid pairs.
   - The logic in `func_15` is unrelated to the problem statement and does not contribute to solving the problem.

5. **Function `func_16` Analysis**:
   - `func_16` calls `func_15` for each test case but does not implement the required logic to solve the problem.
   - Since `func_15` does not solve the problem, `func_16` also does not solve the problem.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not implement the required functionality to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to solve the problem and does not implement the required functionality.
