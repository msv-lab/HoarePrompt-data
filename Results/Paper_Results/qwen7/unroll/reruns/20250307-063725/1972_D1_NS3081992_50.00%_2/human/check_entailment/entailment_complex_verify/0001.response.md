### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement.
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., are utility functions for reading input, but none of them implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - Functions like `func_13` and `func_14` are related to mathematical operations but do not seem to be used in solving the given problem.
   - Function `func_15` calculates a value using a specific formula but does not solve the main problem.
   - Function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, but `func_15` does not solve the problem as described.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The core logic for checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is missing.
   - There is no loop or iteration over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition.
   - The output is hardcoded to call `func_15`, which does not solve the problem as described.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code provides more insight into the functions. `func_15` indeed calculates a value, but it does not address the problem at hand. The logic inside `func_15` is unrelated to the problem requirements.
   - The function `func_16` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, but `func_15` is not solving the problem.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Based on the annotated code, it is clear that the program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. The function `func_15` is not designed to solve the given problem, and the program does not implement the required logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\).
