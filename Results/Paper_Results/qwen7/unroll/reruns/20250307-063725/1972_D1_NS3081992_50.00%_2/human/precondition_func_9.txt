None of the variables in the function `func_10()` are documented in the provided code snippet. The function simply reads an integer input and returns it. However, based on the context, we can infer that the function is part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers n and m. Therefore, the input to `func_10()` is the number of test cases, t.
