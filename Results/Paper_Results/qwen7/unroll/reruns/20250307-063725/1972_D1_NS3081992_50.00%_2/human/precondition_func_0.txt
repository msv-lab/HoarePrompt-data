None of the variables in the provided function contribute to solving the problem directly. The function `func_1()` reads an integer from standard input and returns it. However, based on the problem description, there should be a function that processes the test cases and calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) as described. The precondition should describe the expected input and output for such a function, not for `func_1()`.
