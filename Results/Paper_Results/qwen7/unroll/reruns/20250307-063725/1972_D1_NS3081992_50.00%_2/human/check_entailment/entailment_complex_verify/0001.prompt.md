You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

    #A list containing the results of calling `func_3()` for each of the `rows_number` test cases.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `rows_number` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it calls `func_3()` with two positive integers `n` and `m` (where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). After processing all test cases, it returns a list containing the results of these calls.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_5()` are defined in its signature. This function reads a line from standard input, strips the trailing newline character, and returns it.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the variables in the function `func_10()` are documented in the provided code snippet. The function simply reads an integer input and returns it. However, based on the context, we can infer that the function is part of a larger program that processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers n and m. Therefore, the input to `func_10()` is the number of test cases, t.
def func_10():
    return int(input())
    #The program returns the number of test cases, t, which is an integer input from the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_10()` reads an integer input from the user and returns it as the number of test cases, `t`. This value represents the total number of test cases that will be processed in the subsequent part of the program.

#Function 11:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where keys are integers and values are lists of integers; processing is a list of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of keys in d; da is an integer representing a key in d; rank is a list of zeros with the same length as the number of keys in d.

    #The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of keys in `d`, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of zeros with the same length as the number of keys in `d`. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` where `processing` is temporarily set to 1, updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value found plus one, and returns this updated value.

#Function 13:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6 and b != 0.
def func_13(a, b):
    if (b == 0) :
        x = 1
        y = 0
        return x, y, a
        #The program returns x which is 1, y which is 0, and a which is a positive integer.
    #State: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 2 * 10^6 and b != 0
    x, y, g = func_13(b, a % b)
    return y, x - a // b * y, g
    #The program returns y, x - a // b * y, and g, where y, x, and g are the results of the function call func_13(b, a % b)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 * 10^6 and b ≠ 0). It returns either (1, 0, a) if `b` is 0, or (y, x - a // b * y, g) where y, x, and g are the results of recursively calling `func_13(b, a % b)`. The function essentially computes the extended greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, returning the GCD along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that ax + by = g.

#Function 14:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, n and m are non-negative integers such that 0 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and k is an integer representing a certain threshold value.

            k -= m - a[i]
        
    #State: Output State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is at least m, and k is the initial value minus the sum of differences (m - a[i]) for all i in the range of n where a[i] was less than m initially.
    if (k >= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is at least m, and k is the initial value minus the sum of differences (m - a[i]) for all i in the range of n where a[i] is greater than or equal to m initially.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `a`, two non-negative integers `n` and `m`, and an integer `k`. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and adjusts `k` based on whether each element is less than `m`. If `k` remains non-negative after adjustments, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns -1.

#Function 15:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_15():
    n, m = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        
        i += 1
        
    #State: The value of ans is 0.
    return ans - 1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and calculates a value based on the initial values of `n` and `m` obtained from another function, then returns -1. Specifically, it initializes `ans` to 0, iterates through a loop where it updates `ans` by adding `(n + i) // (i * i)` for each `i` starting from 1 until `i * i` exceeds `n + i`, and finally returns `ans - 1`.

#Function 16:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_16():
    for _ in range(func_10()):
        sys.stdout.write(str(func_15()) + '\n')
        
    #State: t test cases are printed, each containing a single integer generated by func_15().
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, printing one integer per test case. Each test case involves calling `func_15()` which generates an integer value, and this value is written to the standard output followed by a newline. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement.
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., are utility functions for reading input, but none of them implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - Functions like `func_13` and `func_14` are related to mathematical operations but do not seem to be used in solving the given problem.
   - Function `func_15` calculates a value using a specific formula but does not solve the main problem.
   - Function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, but `func_15` does not solve the problem either.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The core logic for checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is missing.
   - There is no loop or iteration over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition.
   - The output is hardcoded to call `func_15`, which does not solve the problem as described.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem and instead calls an unrelated function (`func_15`), it is clear that the given program is incorrect.
