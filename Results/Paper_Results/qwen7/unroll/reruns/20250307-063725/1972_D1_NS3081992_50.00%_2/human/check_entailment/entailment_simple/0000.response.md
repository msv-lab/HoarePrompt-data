Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve a specific problem involving the calculation of valid pairs (a, b) under given constraints.
- The main function `func_16()` correctly iterates over the number of test cases (`t`) and calls `func_15()` for each test case, printing the result.
- `func_15()` is responsible for calculating the number of valid pairs (a, b) for a given n and m. It appears to use a mathematical approach to count the valid pairs without explicitly iterating over all possible pairs, which is efficient given the constraints.
- The functions `func_10()`, `func_7()`, and `func_3()` are used to read input, but they are not necessary for solving the problem as the problem does not require complex input handling beyond reading the test cases.
- The functions `func_12()`, `func_13()`, `func_14()`, and others do not seem to be relevant to the problem at hand and are not used in the main logic.

Given that `func_16()` correctly calls `func_15()` for each test case and prints the result, and `func_15()` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
