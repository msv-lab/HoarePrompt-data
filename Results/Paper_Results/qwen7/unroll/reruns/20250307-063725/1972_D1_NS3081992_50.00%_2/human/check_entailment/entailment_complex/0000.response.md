Reasoning:
- The program is designed to solve the given problem by processing multiple test cases.
- The core logic of the solution is encapsulated in `func_15()`, which calculates the number of valid pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions.
- `func_10()` reads the number of test cases, `func_16()` processes each test case by calling `func_15()` and printing the result.
- The other functions (`func_1()`, `func_2()`, `func_3()`, `func_4()`, `func_5()`, `func_6()`, `func_7()`, `func_8()`, `func_9()`, `func_11()`, `func_12()`, `func_13()`, and `func_14()`) do not seem to be directly involved in solving the problem but rather handle input/output operations or other unrelated tasks.
- Given that `func_15()` correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs (a, b), and `func_16()` correctly processes and prints the results for each test case, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
