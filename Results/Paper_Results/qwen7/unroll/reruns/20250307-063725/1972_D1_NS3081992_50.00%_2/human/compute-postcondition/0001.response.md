Output State: **t test cases are printed, each containing a single integer generated by func_15().**

Explanation: The loop runs `func_10()` times, and in each iteration, it prints the result of `func_15()` followed by a newline character. Since `t` is defined as the number of test cases and the loop runs `func_10()` times, it will print `func_10()` test cases, each containing a single integer generated by `func_15()`.
