Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions**: Many of the functions defined (e.g., `func_12`, `func_13`, `func_14`) are not used in solving the problem and are not relevant to the task at hand.

2. **Missing Main Logic**: The main logic required to solve the problem is missing. Specifically, the program should calculate the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

3. **Incorrect Function Calls**: The function `func_15` is called in `func_16`, but it does not implement the required logic. Instead, it calculates something else (the number of integers up to `n+i` that are divisible by `i*i`).

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, you need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the given ranges and check the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    return ans

def main():
    t = func_10()
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = func_2()
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code defines a function `count_valid_pairs` that iterates through all pairs `(a, b)` and checks the given condition. It then uses this function in the `main` function to process each test case.
