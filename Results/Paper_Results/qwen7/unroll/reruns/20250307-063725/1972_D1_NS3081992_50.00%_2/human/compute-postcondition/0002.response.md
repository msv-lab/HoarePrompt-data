Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes three integers: t, n, and m. The function validates that t is between 1 and 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are between 1 and 2 * 10^6. Additionally, the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^6.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for t, n, and m, ensuring they meet specified constraints.
