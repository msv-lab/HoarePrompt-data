Output State: **The value of ans is 0.**

Explanation: The provided code snippet includes a while loop that runs as long as `i * i <= n + i`. However, the value of `n` is not specified in the initial state or the problem statement. Without knowing `n`, we cannot determine how many times the loop will run or what the final value of `ans` will be. 

Given that `ans` starts at 0 and it is only modified within the loop, if the loop does not execute even once (which happens when `i * i > n + i` initially), then `ans` remains 0. If the loop does execute, each iteration increments `ans` by `(n + i) // (i * i)`, but without knowing `n`, we cannot calculate the exact value of `ans` after the loop. Therefore, based on the information given, the final value of `ans` is 0.
