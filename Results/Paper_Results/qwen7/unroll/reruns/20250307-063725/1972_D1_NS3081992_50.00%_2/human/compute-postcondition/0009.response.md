Output State: **The program returns the value of `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1`**

Explanation: The code `return tmp + 1` indicates that the value of `tmp` (which is the minimum value obtained from `func_12(d, processing, di, rank)` for each `di` in `d[da]` where `processing[di - 1]` was initially 0) is incremented by 1 before being returned. Given that `rank[da - 1]` is set to `tmp + 1`, the return statement essentially returns the value of `rank[da - 1]`.
