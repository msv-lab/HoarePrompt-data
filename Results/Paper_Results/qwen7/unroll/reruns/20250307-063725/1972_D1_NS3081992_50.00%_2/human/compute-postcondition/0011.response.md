Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of keys in `d`, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of zeros with the same length as the number of keys in `d`. It returns 1 if the length of `d[da]` is 1, otherwise it recursively processes each element in `d[da]` where `processing` is temporarily set to 1, updates `rank[da - 1]` to the minimum value found plus one, and returns this updated value.**
