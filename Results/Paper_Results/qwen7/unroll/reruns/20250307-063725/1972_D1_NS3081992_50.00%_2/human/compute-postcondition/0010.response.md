Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where keys are integers and values are lists of integers, a list `processing` of zeros and ones with the same length as the number of keys in `d`, an integer `da` representing a key in `d`, and a list `rank` of zeros with the same length as the number of keys in `d`. It returns 1 in Case_1, and returns the value of `rank[da - 1]` which is `tmp + 1` in Case_2.**
