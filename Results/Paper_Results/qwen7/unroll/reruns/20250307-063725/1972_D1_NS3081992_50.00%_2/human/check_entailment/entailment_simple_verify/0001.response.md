### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code includes several utility functions for reading input, but none of these functions directly address the problem.
   - The function `func_15` is the only one that seems to have some relevant logic. It calculates a value using a specific formula, but this formula does not directly solve the problem.
   - The function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, but `func_15` does not solve the main problem.

3. **Core Logic**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The function `func_15` does not perform this check. Instead, it calculates a value that does not relate to the problem constraints.

4. **Function `func_15`**:
   - The function `func_15` calculates the number of pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b\). This is a simplified version of the problem where \(\gcd(a, b) = 1\).
   - While this function correctly counts pairs under the simplified condition, it does not account for the more general condition where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is not necessarily 1.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. The function `func_15` does not solve the main problem because it does not handle the general case where \(\gcd(a, b)\) is not 1.
   - The output is hardcoded to call `func_15`, which does not solve the problem as described.
