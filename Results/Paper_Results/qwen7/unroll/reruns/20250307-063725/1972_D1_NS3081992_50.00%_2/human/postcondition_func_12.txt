The function `func_13` accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 * 10^6 and b ≠ 0). It returns either (1, 0, a) if `b` is 0, or (y, x - a // b * y, g) where y, x, and g are the results of recursively calling `func_13(b, a % b)`. The function essentially computes the extended greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`, returning the GCD along with the coefficients `x` and `y` such that ax + by = g.
