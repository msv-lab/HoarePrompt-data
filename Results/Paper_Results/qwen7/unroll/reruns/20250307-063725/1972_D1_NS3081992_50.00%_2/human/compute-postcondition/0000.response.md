Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the expression `range(func_10())`. This means the loop will iterate based on the return value of the function `func_10()`. The only variable directly involved here is the loop control variable `_`, but since it is just an underscore (a common convention for a throwaway variable), we don't need to worry about its initial state.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Therefore, we need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial State of `t`**: The variable `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). However, this does not directly affect the loop condition unless `t` is used within `func_10()`. Since no information is provided about how `t` is used in `func_10()`, we cannot assume anything about `t` affecting the loop execution directly.

4. **Function `func_10()`**: We need to ensure that `func_10()` returns a positive integer. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_10()`, we can only say that it must return a positive integer for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the key state that needs to be adjusted is the return value of `func_10()`, ensuring it returns a positive integer.

**State:**
- `func_10()` must return a positive integer.

Since there are no other variables directly involved in the loop head, we do not need to adjust the states of `n` or `m` in this context.

Final Answer:
State: **`func_10()` must return a positive integer**
