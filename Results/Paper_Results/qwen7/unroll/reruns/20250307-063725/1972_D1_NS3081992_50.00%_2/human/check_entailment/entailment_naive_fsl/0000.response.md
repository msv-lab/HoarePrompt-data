Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the required functionality. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided functions do not contain any implementation related to this specific problem. Instead, they contain various utility functions that are not used in solving the problem.

To solve this problem, we would need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). The provided code does not include this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
