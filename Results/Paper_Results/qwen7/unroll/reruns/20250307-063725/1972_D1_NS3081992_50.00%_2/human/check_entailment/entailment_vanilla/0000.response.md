### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code does not contain any function that directly addresses the problem statement.
   - Functions like `func_1`, `func_2`, etc., are utility functions for reading input, but none of them implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - Functions like `func_13` and `func_14` are related to mathematical operations but do not seem to be used in solving the given problem.
   - Function `func_15` calculates a value using a specific formula but does not solve the main problem.
   - Function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, but `func_15` does not solve the problem either.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The core logic for checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is missing.
   - There is no loop or iteration over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition.
   - The output is hardcoded to call `func_15`, which does not solve the problem as described.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the code does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem and instead calls an unrelated function (`func_15`), it is clear that the given program is incorrect.
