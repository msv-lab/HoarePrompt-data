Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and compare it with the requirements of the problem. The problem requires us to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The code provided includes several utility functions, but none of them directly address the problem at hand. Specifically, the function `func_16` is responsible for processing a series of test cases and printing the result of `func_15` for each test case. However, `func_15` itself does not implement the required logic either.

Let's examine `func_15` in detail:
```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```
This function reads \(n\) and \(m\) from the input using `func_7`, which is equivalent to `func_3`. It then iterates over values of \(i\) starting from 1 and calculates a value for `ans` based on the formula \((n + i) // (i * i)\). Finally, it returns `ans - 1`.

However, this function does not check the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it appears to be calculating some other value based on \(n\) and \(i\).

Given the structure of the code, it seems that the original assessment might have been overly critical. While the code does not correctly solve the problem as stated, it does contain the necessary framework to process test cases and call a function that should theoretically solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that `func_15` is not implemented correctly to solve the problem.

If we were to implement the correct logic inside `func_15`, it would involve iterating through all pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). This would involve implementing a GCD function and a nested loop to iterate through all pairs.

Since the original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect and did not provide an opportunity to implement the correct logic, the assessment is accurate in its conclusion that the current implementation is incorrect.

Final: **False**
