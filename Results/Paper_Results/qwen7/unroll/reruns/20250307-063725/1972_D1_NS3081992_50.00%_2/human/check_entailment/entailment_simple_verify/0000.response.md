### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Provided Functions**:
   - **Function 16**: This is the main function that processes the test cases. It calls `func_15` for each test case and prints the result.
   - **Function 15**: This function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs for a given \(n\) and \(m\). However, the current implementation of `func_15` does not correctly implement the required logic.

3. **Function 15 Analysis**:
   - The function `func_15` currently just reads \(n\) and \(m\) and returns `-1` without performing any calculations.
   - This does not match the problem requirements and is clearly incorrect.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to iterate through all pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).
   - We need to implement a function that correctly counts the number of valid pairs for given \(n\) and \(m\).

Given the current implementation, `func_15` does not perform the necessary calculations and instead returns a hardcoded value `-1`. Therefore, the program as it stands is indeed incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not implement the required functionality and returns incorrect results. The program needs to be corrected to properly count the number of valid pairs.

**Final: False**
