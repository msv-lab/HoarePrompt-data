Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether `func_16` and the supporting functions correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the components:

1. **Reading Input**: The program should read multiple test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( m \).
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each pair \( (n, m) \), the program needs to count the number of ordered pairs \( (a, b) \) such that \( 1 \leq a \leq n \), \( 1 \leq b \leq m \), and \( a + b \) is a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \).
3. **Outputting Results**: The program should print the result for each test case.

Let's examine the functions:

- `func_10`: Reads the number of test cases \( t \).
- `func_7`: Reads a line of space-separated integers and returns them as a list.
- `func_15`: Implements the logic to count valid pairs \( (a, b) \) for a given \( n \) and \( m \).
- `func_16`: Processes each test case by calling `func_15` and printing the result.

Now, let's focus on `func_15` since it directly handles the core logic of counting valid pairs:

```python
def func_15():
    (n, m) = func_7()
    i = 1
    ans = 0
    while i * i <= n + i:
        ans += (n + i) // (i * i)
        i += 1
    return ans - 1
```

This function:
- Reads \( n \) and \( m \) using `func_7`.
- Initializes `ans` to 0.
- Iterates through values of \( i \) starting from 1 up to the point where \( i^2 > n + i \).
- For each \( i \), it adds \( \frac{n + i}{i^2} \) to `ans`.

However, the logic in `func_15` does not correctly implement the required condition \( a + b \) being a multiple of \( b \cdot \gcd(a, b) \). Instead, it appears to be calculating some other mathematical expression related to \( n \) and \( i \).

Given the problem requirements, a correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs \( (a, b) \) and checking the condition \( a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)} \).

Since `func_15` does not correctly implement the required logic, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
