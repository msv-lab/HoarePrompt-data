### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code consists of utility functions for reading input, but there is no function that implements the logic to solve the problem.
   - Function `func_15` calculates a value using a specific formula but does not solve the main problem. This function likely calculates the number of valid pairs for a simplified case or a different problem.
   - Function `func_16` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_15` for each test case, but `func_15` does not solve the problem as described.

3. **Missing Logic**:
   - The core logic for checking the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is missing.
   - There is no loop or iteration over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) to check the condition.
   - The output is hardcoded to call `func_15`, which does not solve the problem as described.

4. **Function `func_15` Analysis**:
   - Function `func_15` uses a formula to calculate a value, but it does not address the problem constraints. Specifically, it does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The formula used in `func_15` is:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \sum_{i=1}^{\sqrt{n+i}} \left(\frac{n+i}{i^2}\right) - 1
     \]
     This formula does not correspond to the problem statement and is not relevant to the solution.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem. It relies on a function (`func_15`) that does not address the problem constraints.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
