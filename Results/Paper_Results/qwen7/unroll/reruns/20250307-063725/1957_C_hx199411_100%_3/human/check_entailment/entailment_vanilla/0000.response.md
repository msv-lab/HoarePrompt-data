### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You start first, and for each of your moves, the computer mirrors your move by placing a rook in the mirrored position.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after you and the computer have made \( k \) moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move you make is mirrored by the computer unless the row and column indices are the same.
   - After \( k \) moves, the remaining empty cells form a subset of the \( n \times n \) grid.
   - The number of ways to fill these remaining cells is what needs to be calculated.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of positions that are either fixed due to mirrored moves or can be freely chosen.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of positions that are fixed due to mirrored moves.
   - The remaining positions `m = n - num` are those that can be freely chosen.
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to fill these remaining positions.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation:**
   - The DP array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to fill up to `i` positions.
   - The base cases are initialized correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions to fill, so only one configuration is possible.
   - When `m == 1`, there is exactly one position to fill, also resulting in one configuration.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations based on the problem statement and constraints.
