Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `num`:**
   - The variable `num` is intended to count the number of unique positions where rooks can be placed. However, the logic for counting `num` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if c == r:` should not add `2` to `num`, but rather `1`. This is because when `c == r`, only one unique position is added, not two.

2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization:**
   - The dynamic programming table `dp` is initialized incorrectly. The base cases for `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` should be set to `1` and `3` respectively, but the logic inside the loop needs to be adjusted to correctly compute the values.

3. **Modulo Operation:**
   - The modulo operation `(10 ** 9 + 7)` is applied correctly, but the logic inside the loop needs to be refined to ensure the correct computation of the number of configurations.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for _ in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
- **Counting Unique Positions (`num`):** 
  - If `c == r`, it means the rook is placed on the diagonal, so `num` increments by `1`.
  - Otherwise, it increments by `2`.

- **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp`):**
  - `dp[1]` is `1` because there is only one way to place one rook.
  - `dp[2]` is `3` because there are three ways to place two non-attacking rooks on a 2x2 board.
  - For `i >= 3`, the recurrence relation is `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)`.

This corrected version should now accurately compute the number of possible final configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
