#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and no two rooks of the same color share the same row or column after each of the k moves and their mirrored moves.

    #State: Output State: The output state will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The given code processes multiple test cases within the while loop. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), then iterates \(k\) times to read pairs of integers \(c\) and \(r\). It calculates \(num\) based on these pairs and then determines \(m = n - num\). Depending on the value of \(m\), it either prints 1 or proceeds to compute a dynamic programming array \(dp\) to print a specific value. Since the inputs \(n\), \(k\), and the pairs \((c, r)\) can vary for each test case, the final output will depend on these inputs. Without specific input values, we cannot determine a fixed output state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), followed by \(k\) pairs of integers representing rook positions. It calculates the number of rooks that do not share the same row or column with any other rook after the specified moves. Based on this count, it computes a specific value using dynamic programming and prints it. If the conditions are not met for any test case, it prints 1.
