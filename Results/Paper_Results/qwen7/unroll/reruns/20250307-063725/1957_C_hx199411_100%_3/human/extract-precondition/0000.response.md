Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and no two rooks of the same color share the same row or column after each of the k moves and their mirrored moves.**
