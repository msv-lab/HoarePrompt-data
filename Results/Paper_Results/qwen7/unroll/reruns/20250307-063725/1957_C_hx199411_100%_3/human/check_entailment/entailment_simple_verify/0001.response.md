### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You start first, and for each of your moves, the computer mirrors your move by placing a rook in the mirrored position.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after you and the computer have made \( k \) moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move you make is mirrored by the computer unless the row and column indices are the same.
   - After \( k \) moves, the remaining empty cells form a subset of the \( n \times n \) grid.
   - The number of ways to fill these remaining cells is what needs to be calculated.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of positions that are either fixed due to mirrored moves or can be freely chosen.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of positions that are fixed due to mirrored moves.
   - The remaining positions `m = n - num` are those that can be freely chosen.
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to fill these remaining positions.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation:**
   - The DP array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to fill up to `i` positions.
   - The base cases are initialized correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions to fill, so only one configuration is possible.
   - When `m == 1`, there is exactly one position to fill, also resulting in one configuration.

6. **Detailed Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code correctly handles the edge cases where `m == 0` and `m == 1`.
   - The dynamic programming approach is sound and correctly computes the number of configurations for larger values of `m`.

7. **Validation Using Annotated Code:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The code accurately reflects the problem constraints and the solution approach.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations based on the problem statement and constraints. The dynamic programming approach is appropriate and correctly handles all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct.
