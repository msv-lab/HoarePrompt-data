You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n; for each test case, r_i and c_i are integers such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and no two rooks of the same color share the same row or column after each of the k moves and their mirrored moves.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        num = 0
        
        for i in range(k):
            c, r = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c == r:
                num += 1
            else:
                num += 2
        
        m = n - num
        
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [(0) for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: The given code processes multiple test cases within the while loop. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), then iterates \(k\) times to read pairs of integers \(c\) and \(r\). It calculates \(num\) based on these pairs and then determines \(m = n - num\). Depending on the value of \(m\), it either prints 1 or proceeds to compute a dynamic programming array \(dp\) to print a specific value. Since the inputs \(n\), \(k\), and the pairs \((c, r)\) can vary for each test case, the final output will depend on these inputs. Without specific input values, we cannot determine a fixed output state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 1 and 3 ⋅ 10^5), k (an integer between 0 and n), and a series of moves defined by r_i and c_i (integers between 1 and n). The function checks if no two rooks of the same color share the same row or column after each of the k moves and their mirrored moves. If all conditions are met, it returns a specific value indicating validity; otherwise, it returns an error or invalid state.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
