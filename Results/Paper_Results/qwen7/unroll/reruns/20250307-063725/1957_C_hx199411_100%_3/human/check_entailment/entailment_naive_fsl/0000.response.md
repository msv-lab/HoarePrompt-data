Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the logic for updating `num` is incorrect. The variable `num` is supposed to count the number of unique rows and columns that have been occupied by rooks, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly. For example, consider the following scenario:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  2 1
  1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly calculates `num` as 2 instead of 1, leading to an incorrect final configuration count. The correct approach would be to maintain a set of occupied rows and columns and update it accordingly. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        occupied_rows = set()
        occupied_cols = set()
        for i in range(k):
            (r, c) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if r != c:
                occupied_rows.add(r)
                occupied_cols.add(c)
            else:
                occupied_rows.add(r)
        
        m = n - len(occupied_rows) - len(occupied_cols) + len(occupied_rows.intersection(occupied_cols))
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for _ in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of available positions for placing rooks is accurately calculated, leading to the correct number of final configurations.
