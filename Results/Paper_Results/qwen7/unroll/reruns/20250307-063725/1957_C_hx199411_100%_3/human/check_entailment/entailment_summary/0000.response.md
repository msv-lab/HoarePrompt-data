Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the chessboard \(n\) and the number of moves \(k\) that have already been made.
3. It then iterates through the \(k\) moves, counting how many rooks are placed on the main diagonal (where \(r = c\)) and how many are off the diagonal.
4. The variable `num` keeps track of the number of rooks that are either on the main diagonal or off the diagonal in a way that allows for mirrored placements.
5. After processing the moves, it calculates the number of remaining positions (`m = n - num`) that are neither on the main diagonal nor have been mirrored.
6. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations for the remaining positions. This is done correctly by initializing a DP array and filling it according to the given formula.
7. The final result is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
