Output State: The output state will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. Specifically, it will depend on the values of `n`, `k`, and the pairs of integers `(c, r)` provided for each value of `k`.

During each iteration of the loop:
1. The value of `t` is decremented by 1.
2. The user is prompted to enter two integers `n` and `k`.
3. A variable `num` is initialized to 0.
4. For each of the `k` pairs `(c, r)`, if `c` equals `r`, `num` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `num` is incremented by 2.
5. The value of `m` is calculated as `n - num`.
6. Depending on the value of `m`:
   - If `m` is 0 or 1, the program prints `1`.
   - Otherwise, a dynamic programming array `dp` is filled with values based on previous values in the array, and the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\) is printed.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, and the pairs `(c, r)` are not specified, the final output cannot be precisely determined without these inputs. However, the output will always be either `1` or a value computed using dynamic programming based on the input parameters.
