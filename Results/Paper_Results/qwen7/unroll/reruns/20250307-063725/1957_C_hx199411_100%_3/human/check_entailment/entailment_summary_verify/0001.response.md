### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves an \( n \times n \) chessboard where you and the computer take turns placing rooks.
   - You start first, and for each of your moves, the computer mirrors your move by placing a rook in the mirrored position.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of different final configurations possible after you and the computer have made \( k \) moves.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each move you make is mirrored by the computer unless the row and column indices are the same.
   - After \( k \) moves, the remaining empty cells form a subset of the \( n \times n \) grid.
   - The number of ways to fill these remaining cells is what needs to be calculated.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of positions that are either fixed due to mirrored moves or can be freely chosen.
   - The variable `num` counts the number of positions that are fixed due to mirrored moves.
   - The remaining positions `m = n - num` are those that can be freely chosen.
   - The code uses dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to fill these remaining positions.

4. **Dynamic Programming Explanation:**
   - The DP array `dp` is used to store the number of ways to fill up to `i` positions.
   - The base cases are initialized correctly (`dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`).
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` correctly accounts for the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining positions.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `m == 0`, there are no remaining positions to fill, so only one configuration is possible.
   - When `m == 1`, there is exactly one position to fill, also resulting in one configuration.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given code correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations based on the problem statement and constraints.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic used to calculate `num`. Specifically, the code incorrectly increments `num` by 2 for positions where \( c \neq r \). This is because the computer mirrors your move, but the code does not account for the fact that the computer's move is also a valid rook placement. Therefore, the number of fixed positions should only be incremented by 1 for each unique position, not 2.

### Corrected Dynamic Programming Explanation:
- The correct approach is to increment `num` by 1 for each unique position, whether mirrored or not.
- The remaining positions `m = n - num` should then be used to compute the number of ways to fill these positions.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        num = 0
        for i in range(k):
            (c, r) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
            if c != r:
                num += 1
        m = n - num
        if m == 0:
            print(1)
        elif m == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            dp = [0 for i in range(m + 1)]
            dp[1] = 1
            dp[2] = 3
            for i in range(3, m + 1):
                dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
            print(dp[m])
```

### Conclusion:
The original code incorrectly increments `num` by 2 for each unique position, leading to an overestimation of the number of fixed positions. The corrected code should increment `num` by 1 for each unique position, ensuring the correct calculation of the number of remaining positions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
