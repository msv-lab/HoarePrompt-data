Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of integers `(r, c)` representing the positions of the rooks placed by the player and the computer.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The function correctly handles the mirroring logic. If `c == r`, it increments `num` by 1, indicating that the rook cannot be mirrored. Otherwise, it increments `num` by 2, indicating that both the original and mirrored positions are valid.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations. The base cases (`dp[1]` and `dp[2]`) are correctly initialized. The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] * 2) % (10 ** 9 + 7)` is used to compute the number of configurations for `m` empty slots, which is derived from `m = n - num`.

4. **Output Handling**: The function correctly handles the output for different values of `m`. If `m` is 0 or 1, it prints 1. Otherwise, it prints the computed value from the dynamic programming table.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function processes each test case appropriately and computes the correct number of possible final configurations based on the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
