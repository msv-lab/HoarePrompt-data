Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 1 and 3 â‹… 10^5), k (an integer between 0 and n), and a series of moves defined by r_i and c_i (integers between 1 and n). The function checks if no two rooks of the same color share the same row or column after each of the k moves and their mirrored moves. If all conditions are met, it returns a specific value indicating validity; otherwise, it returns an error or invalid state.**
