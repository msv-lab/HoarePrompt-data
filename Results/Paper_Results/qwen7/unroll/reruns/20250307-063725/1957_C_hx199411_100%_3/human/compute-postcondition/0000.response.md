Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property but now holds the specific value entered by the user. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the current code snippet. The precondition that no two rooks of the same color share the same row or column after each of the k moves and their mirrored moves is also preserved but not affected by the current code.
