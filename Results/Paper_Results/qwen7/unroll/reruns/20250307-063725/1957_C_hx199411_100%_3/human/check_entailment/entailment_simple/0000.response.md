Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by `k` pairs of coordinates `(r_i, c_i)` representing the moves made by the player and the computer.

2. **Mirroring Logic**: The program correctly counts the number of moves where the row and column indices are the same (`c == r`). For these moves, only one rook is placed, contributing `1` to `num`. For other moves, it contributes `2` to `num`.

3. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**: The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations. This part of the logic seems correct and follows the given problem constraints.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly where `m` (the remaining number of positions) is `0` or `1`, printing `1` in those cases.

5. **Modulo Operation**: The program ensures that the result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary due to the large size of the inputs.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
