Output State: The output state will vary based on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: The given code processes multiple test cases within the while loop. For each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), then iterates \(k\) times to read pairs of integers \(c\) and \(r\). It calculates \(num\) based on these pairs and then determines \(m = n - num\). Depending on the value of \(m\), it either prints 1 or proceeds to compute a dynamic programming array \(dp\) to print a specific value. Since the inputs \(n\), \(k\), and the pairs \((c, r)\) can vary for each test case, the final output will depend on these inputs. Without specific input values, we cannot determine a fixed output state.
