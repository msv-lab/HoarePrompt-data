The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), followed by \(k\) pairs of integers representing rook positions. It calculates the number of rooks that do not share the same row or column with any other rook after the specified moves. Based on this count, it computes a specific value using dynamic programming and prints it. If the conditions are not met for any test case, it prints 1.
