Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Conditions Check**: The condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` is not correctly checked in the nested loops. Specifically, the current implementation checks `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`, which is not relevant to the problem's requirement. Instead, it should check the condition directly using the values of `a` and `b`.

2. **Bounds and Multiples Calculation**: The logic for calculating `min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))` is not aligned with the problem's requirements. This calculation should be based on the actual values of `a` and `b` rather than `x` and `y`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def gcd_multiple_check(a, b):
    return (b * math.gcd(a, b)) % (a + b) == 0

def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if gcd_multiple_check(a, b):
                count += 1
    print(count)

def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()

func_2()
```

This corrected version properly checks the condition `b * gcd(a, b)` being a multiple of `a + b` and counts the valid pairs accordingly.
