### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function summaries to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\)

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single test case.
   - It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x\) and \(y\) are placeholders for \(a\) and \(b\)).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - If these conditions are met, it increments the count `cnt` with the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then calls `func_1` \(t\) times.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary for `func_2` indicates that it correctly processes each test case by calling `func_1` exactly once per test case.

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
  - The constraints \(1 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^6\) and \(n + m\) not exceeding \(2 \cdot 10^6\) are handled.
  - The nested loops in `func_1` ensure that all possible pairs \((x, y)\) within the given ranges are checked.
  - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) ensures that we only consider coprime pairs, which simplifies the problem.

- **Logic Verification:**
  - The logic inside `func_1` correctly checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
  - The use of `math.gcd(x, y)` ensures that the greatest common divisor is calculated accurately.
  - The incrementation of `cnt` using the minimum of the two floor divisions ensures that the count is correctly updated.

- **Input Handling:**
  - Both functions handle the input correctly by reading from standard input and printing the result to standard output.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description, function summaries, and the detailed analysis.
