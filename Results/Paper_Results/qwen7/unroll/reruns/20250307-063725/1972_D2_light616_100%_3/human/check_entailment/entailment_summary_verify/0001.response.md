### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summaries.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) using a nested loop.
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each test case.

4. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The nested loop structure is designed to check pairs \((a, b)\) efficiently.
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly checked.
   - The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is a necessary but not sufficient condition; we need to ensure the overall condition holds.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no pairs satisfy the conditions (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The program correctly handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

7. **Function Summary**:
   - The summary correctly states that `func_2` processes a series of test cases and calls `func_1` exactly \(t\) times.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Nested Loop Analysis**:
  - The outer loop iterates over \(x\) from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\).
  - The inner loop iterates over \(y\) such that \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
  - The condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is checked, which is a necessary condition but not sufficient.

- **Condition Check**:
  - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly checked.
  - However, the current implementation only checks \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and does not fully verify the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

- **Sufficient Condition**:
  - The program should also check if \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is indeed a multiple of \(a + b\). The current implementation only checks \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), which is insufficient.

### Conclusion:

The program is close to being correct but fails to fully verify the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not fully verify the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
