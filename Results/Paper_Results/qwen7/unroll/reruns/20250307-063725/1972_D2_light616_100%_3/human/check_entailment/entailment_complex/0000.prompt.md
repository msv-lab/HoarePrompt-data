Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

# Annotated Functions:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and n, m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: cnt is the sum of minimum values calculated for each pair (x, y) where x and y are coprime, and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of minimum values for each pair (x, y) satisfying the given conditions)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the user, calculates the sum of the minimum values for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime and satisfy the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), and prints the total sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and after the loop executes all the iterations, t remains the same value it was initially set to. The variable `func_1()` is called t times, but no other variables are defined or modified within the loop, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(m\), under specific constraints (1 ≤ \(n\), \(m\) ≤ 2⋅10^6 and \(n + m\) does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases), and an integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. It calls the function `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times without modifying any variables outside of this call. After completing all iterations, the value of \(t\) remains unchanged.
