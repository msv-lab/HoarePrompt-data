The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(m\), under specific constraints (1 ≤ \(n\), \(m\) ≤ 2⋅10^6 and \(n + m\) does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases), and an integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. It calls the function `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times without modifying any variables outside of this call. After completing all iterations, the value of \(t\) remains unchanged.
