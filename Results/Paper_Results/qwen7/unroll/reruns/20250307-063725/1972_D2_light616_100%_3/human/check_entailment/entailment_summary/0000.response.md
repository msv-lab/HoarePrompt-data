Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).
- The solution is implemented in two functions:
  - `func_1()`: This function reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the user, iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) (where \(x \le \sqrt{n}\) and \(y\) is adjusted accordingly), checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), and counts valid pairs.
  - `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by repeatedly calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summaries:
- `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find valid pairs \((x, y)\) within the specified ranges.
- `func_2()` correctly processes multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

Since both functions together correctly implement the required logic and handle the problem constraints appropriately, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
