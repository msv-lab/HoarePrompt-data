You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(m\), under specific constraints (1 ≤ \(n\), \(m\) ≤ 2⋅10^6 and \(n + m\) does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases), and an integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. It calls the function `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times without modifying any variables outside of this call. After completing all iterations, the value of \(t\) remains unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and `y` iterates from 1 to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the solution handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

4. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The algorithm correctly iterates through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given constraints.
   - It correctly checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is a necessary condition but not sufficient; we need to ensure the overall condition holds.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no pairs satisfy the conditions (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The program correctly handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The algorithm and the implementation are consistent with the problem statement.
