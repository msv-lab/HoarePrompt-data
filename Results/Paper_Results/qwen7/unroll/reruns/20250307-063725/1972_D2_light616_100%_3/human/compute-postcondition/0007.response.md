Functionality: **The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the user, calculates the sum of the minimum values for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime and satisfy the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), and prints the total sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
