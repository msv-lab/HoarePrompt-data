Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and `y` iterates from 1 to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the solution handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

4. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The algorithm correctly iterates through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given constraints.
   - It correctly checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is a necessary condition but not sufficient; we need to ensure the overall condition holds.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no pairs satisfy the conditions (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The program correctly handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The algorithm and the implementation are consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
