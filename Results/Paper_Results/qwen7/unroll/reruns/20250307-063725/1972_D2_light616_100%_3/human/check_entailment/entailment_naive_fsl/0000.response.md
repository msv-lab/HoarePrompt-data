Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided examples and the nature of the problem.
