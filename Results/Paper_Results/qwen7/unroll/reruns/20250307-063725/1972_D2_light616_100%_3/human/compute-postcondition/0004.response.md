Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where each test case includes two integers, n and m, under specific constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases), and an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. The function does not return any value but presumably performs some operations based on the given inputs.**
