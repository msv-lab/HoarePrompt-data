You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * b \cdot \gcd(a,b) is a multiple of a+b . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    0
    1
    1
    6
    423
    5933961
    
Note

In the first test case, no pair satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case, (2,2),(3,6),(4,4),(6,3),(6,6),(8,8) satisfy the
conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        x += 1
    print(cnt)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Annotated Code: 
import math

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and n, m are within the limits specified in the problem description.
def func_1():
    x = 1
    cnt = 0
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    while x * x <= n:
        y = 1
        
        while (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m:
            if math.gcd(x, y) == 1:
                cnt += min(n // ((x + y) * x), m // ((x + y) * y))
            y += 1
        
        x += 1
        
    #State: cnt is the sum of minimum values calculated for each pair (x, y) where x and y are coprime, and (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m.
    print(cnt)
    #This is printed: cnt (where cnt is the sum of minimum values for each pair (x, y) satisfying the given conditions)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \) from the user, calculates the sum of the minimum values for each pair \((x, y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime and satisfy the conditions \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\), and prints the total sum. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6 and n + m does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and after the loop executes all the iterations, t remains the same value it was initially set to. The variable `func_1()` is called t times, but no other variables are defined or modified within the loop, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing two integers \(n\) and \(m\), under specific constraints (1 ≤ \(n\), \(m\) ≤ 2⋅10^6 and \(n + m\) does not exceed 2⋅10^6 across all test cases), and an integer \(t\) (1 ≤ \(t\) ≤ 10^4) indicating the number of test cases. It calls the function `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times without modifying any variables outside of this call. After completing all iterations, the value of \(t\) remains unchanged.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. It iterates through possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1` for each one. Given the constraints and the logic used, the program appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided examples and the nature of the problem.
