Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\) from the input.
   - It iterates over possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(x \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \times y \leq m\).
   - It checks if \(x\) and \(y\) are coprime using `math.gcd(x, y) == 1`.
   - If they are coprime, it adds the minimum of \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \times x} \right\rfloor \) and \( \left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \times y} \right\rfloor \) to the count.
   - Finally, it prints the count, which represents the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\).

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function correctly reads an integer \(t\) indicating the number of test cases.
   - It processes each test case by calling `func_1()` exactly \(t\) times.
   - Since `func_1()` does not modify any external variables, the state of the program remains consistent throughout the execution of `func_2()`.

Given the problem description and the annotated functions, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. Both functions handle the input and output as required, and there are no logical errors or missing steps.

Correctness: **True**
