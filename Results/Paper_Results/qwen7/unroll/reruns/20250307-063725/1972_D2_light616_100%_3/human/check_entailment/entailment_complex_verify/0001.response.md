### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the original assessment and verify the correctness of the program step by step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for a single test case.
   - It uses a nested loop where `x` iterates from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) and `y` iterates from 1 to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it increments the count by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It ensures that the solution handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem.

4. **Algorithm Verification**:
   - The algorithm correctly iterates through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given constraints.
   - It correctly checks the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).
   - The use of \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) is a necessary condition but not sufficient; we need to ensure the overall condition holds.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where no pairs satisfy the conditions (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The program correctly handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

6. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: The program starts with reading \(t\) (number of test cases).
- **Test Case Processing**: For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
- **Nested Loops**: The outer loop runs from 1 to \(\sqrt{n}\) for \(x\), and the inner loop runs from 1 to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).
- **GCD Check**: For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\). If true, it calculates the minimum value and adds it to the count.
- **Output**: The final count is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- **Loop Conditions**: The loops are correctly set up to iterate over the valid range of \(x\) and \(y\) values.
- **GCD Calculation**: The \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) check is correctly implemented.
- **Condition Check**: The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is correctly checked.
- **Count Calculation**: The count is correctly updated by adding the minimum value for each valid pair.
- **Output**: The output matches the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

Based on the detailed analysis and the annotations, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) for each test case. The algorithm and the implementation are consistent with the problem statement.
