Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**:
   - The function takes two integers \( n \) and \( m \) as input and calculates the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
   - It uses a nested loop to iterate through possible values of \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( x \leq \sqrt{n} \) and \( y \) is iterated up to a point where the conditions \( (x + y) \times x \leq n \) and \( (x + y) \times y \leq m \) hold.
   - For each valid pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) and calculates the contribution to the count using the minimum of the division results of \( n \) and \( m \) by \((x + y) \times x\) and \((x + y) \times y\) respectively.
   - The function correctly prints the total count of valid pairs for the given \( n \) and \( m \).

2. **Function 2 Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - It then iterates \( t \) times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1()` is called exactly \( t \) times and no other variables are defined or modified within the loop, the state of the program remains consistent with the problem requirements.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Each call to `func_1()` processes the input \( n \) and \( m \) correctly and prints the result.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program align with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Based on the above analysis, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
