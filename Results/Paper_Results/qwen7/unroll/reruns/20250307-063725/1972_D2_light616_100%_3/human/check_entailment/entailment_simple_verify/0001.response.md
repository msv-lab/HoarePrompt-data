### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\),
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\),
3. \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` starts from 1 and iterates up to \(\sqrt{n}\).
   - `cnt` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the count of valid pairs.

2. **Outer Loop**:
   - For each value of `x`, `y` starts from 1 and iterates up to a value ensuring \((x + y) \cdot x \leq n\) and \((x + y) \cdot y \leq m\).

3. **Inner Loop**:
   - For each pair \((x, y)\), it checks if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - If true, it increments `cnt` by the minimum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n}{(x + y) \cdot x} \right\rfloor\) and \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{(x + y) \cdot y} \right\rfloor\).

4. **Conditions Check**:
   - The condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\) is not directly checked in the code. Instead, the code assumes that if \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\), then the condition might hold. However, this is not sufficient because \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) does not guarantee that \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) is a multiple of \(a + b\).

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
1. **Reading Test Cases**:
   - Reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - Calls `func_1` for each test case.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs `t` times, calling `func_1` for each test case.

#### Edge Cases and Constraints:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the edge case where no pairs satisfy the conditions (e.g., \(n = 1, m = 1\)).
   - The program correctly handles larger values of \(n\) and \(m\) up to \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

#### Algorithm Verification:
1. **Algorithm Correctness**:
   - The algorithm iterates through possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given constraints.
   - It correctly checks the condition \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\).
   - However, it does not verify the actual condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\).

2. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected results for the provided examples, but this does not guarantee the correctness of the algorithm for all cases.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) because it does not verify the condition \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\) being a multiple of \(a + b\). The assumption that \(\gcd(x, y) = 1\) implies the condition is not valid.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
