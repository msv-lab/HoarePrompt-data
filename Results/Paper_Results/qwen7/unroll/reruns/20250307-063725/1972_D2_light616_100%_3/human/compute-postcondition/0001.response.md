Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a common placeholder for an unused variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The variable `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` will always be a positive integer, but we need to explicitly state this condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `t` must be a positive integer.

**State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive**
