Reasoning:
1. The provided program seems to aim at solving the problem correctly by calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
2. The program reads the input and constructs an auxiliary array `b` which stores cumulative costs based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`.
3. The logic for constructing `b` appears to be based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, and it uses these differences to compute the minimum cost for each query.
4. The program then processes each query by using the precomputed values in `b` to find the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.
5. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the approach taken in the program should theoretically work, as it correctly identifies the closest city and computes the minimum cost based on the unique closest city property.

Based on the execution summary and the provided reasoning, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
