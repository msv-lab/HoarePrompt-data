Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9); `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5; for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i; `r` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and mapping each element to an integer.**

The code defines a lambda function `r` that reads a line of input, splits it into multiple space-separated integers, and maps each of these integers to an integer type. However, no actual input is taken or processed in this snippet, so the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `m`, and the queries remain unchanged. The lambda function `r` is now available to be used later in the program to read inputs.
