Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, an integer `m`, and `m` pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)` for each query. For each query, it checks if `x_i` and `y_i` are valid indices within the list `a` and returns a result based on the values at these indices.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and queries. It processes each test case according to the given constraints and returns results for each query based on the indices provided.
