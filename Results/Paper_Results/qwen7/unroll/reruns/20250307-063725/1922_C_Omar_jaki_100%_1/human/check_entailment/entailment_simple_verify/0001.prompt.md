You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of differences calculated based on the values of `b` array after processing each query.
    #
    #Explanation: Given the complexity of the code, it's important to break down what happens inside the loop:
    #
    #1. **Initialization and Input**: 
    #   - `t` is decremented and `r()` is called, which presumably provides some input.
    #   - `a` is initialized with very large negative and positive values, followed by a call to `r()` which presumably fills the rest of the list with `n` integers in strictly increasing order.
    #   - `b` is initialized as `[0, 0]`.
    #   - For each set of four consecutive elements `(w, x, y, z)` in `a`, the difference `v = y - x` is calculated, and then two new values are appended to `b` based on conditions involving `v`.
    #
    #2. **Query Processing**:
    #   - `u` is decremented and `r()` is called, which presumably provides the number of queries.
    #   - For each query, two indices `c` and `d` are read.
    #   - If `c < d`, the difference between the values at indices `(d-1)*2` and `(c-1)*2` in `b` is printed.
    #   - Otherwise, the difference between the values at indices `c*2-1` and `d*2-1` in `b` is printed.
    #
    #Since the exact values of `a` and the results of `r()` calls are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `b`. However, the final state of `b` will depend on the operations performed during each iteration of the loop, which involve calculating differences and appending them to `b`.
    #
    #The output state will be a series of these differences, printed out according to the conditions specified in the inner while loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost to travel directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code uses a lambda function `r` to read multiple integers from input.
   - It processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the cities into an array `a`.
   - It constructs a modified array `a` with additional boundary values (`-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`) to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates through the array to compute some values stored in `b`. The computation seems to involve differences and conditional checks.
   - Finally, it processes each query to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the precomputed values in `b`.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The construction of the `b` array should correctly capture the cumulative costs to reach each city considering the unique closest city property.
   - The logic for handling queries should correctly use the precomputed values in `b` to determine the minimum cost.

4. **Testing the Logic:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is used to verify the correctness.
   - The output matches the expected results, indicating that the logic for constructing `b` and processing queries is correct.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles boundary values correctly by adding `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` to the array.
   - The logic for computing the minimum cost in queries appears to be sound.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the analysis and the matching outputs, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.
