### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost to travel directly to another city is the absolute difference in their coordinates.

2. **Given Code Analysis:**
   - The code uses a lambda function `r` to read multiple integers from input.
   - It processes each test case in a loop.
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the cities into an array `a`.
   - It constructs a modified array `a` with additional boundary values (`-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0`) to handle edge cases.
   - It then iterates through the array to compute some values stored in `b`. The computation seems to involve differences and conditional checks.
   - Finally, it processes each query to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the precomputed values in `b`.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The construction of the `b` array should correctly capture the cumulative costs to reach each city considering the unique closest city property.
   - The logic for handling queries should correctly use the precomputed values in `b` to determine the minimum cost.

4. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The code initializes `a` with very large negative and positive values to handle edge cases properly.
   - The loop constructs the `b` array by iterating through the elements of `a` and performing conditional checks. This part of the code is complex and involves differences and conditional logic.
   - The `b` array is built such that `b[i]` stores the cumulative cost to reach the `i-th` city considering the unique closest city property.
   - The queries are processed by accessing the precomputed values in `b` to determine the minimum cost.

5. **Testing the Logic:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement is used to verify the correctness.
   - The output matches the expected results, indicating that the logic for constructing `b` and processing queries is correct.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles boundary values correctly by adding `-1000000000.0` and `2000000000.0` to the array.
   - The logic for computing the minimum cost in queries appears to be sound.

7. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the process of constructing the `b` array and processing queries.
   - The logic for handling the queries and the construction of `b` aligns with the problem requirements.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Based on the detailed analysis and the matching outputs, the provided code correctly implements the solution for the given problem.
