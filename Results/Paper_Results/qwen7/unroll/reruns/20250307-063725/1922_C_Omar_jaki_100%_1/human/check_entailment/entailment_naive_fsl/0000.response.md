Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to use a rolling sum approach to calculate distances, but it does not accurately determine the closest city for each query. The logic inside the `for` loop is flawed and does not correctly compute the minimum number of coins needed to travel between any two cities.

To illustrate, consider the example provided in the problem statement with the cities located at points `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`. The program should correctly output the minimum number of coins for each query, but instead, it fails to do so due to its incorrect implementation. For instance, in the first query where the cities are `1` and `4`, the correct minimum number of coins is `3`, but the program might output an incorrect value because it does not properly account for the unique closest city rule and the cost of traveling to the closest city.

Here is a brief breakdown of the issues:
1. The program incorrectly uses a rolling sum approach to calculate distances, which does not align with the problem requirements.
2. It does not correctly identify the closest city for each query, leading to incorrect results.

Since the program does not handle the logic correctly for at least one potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
