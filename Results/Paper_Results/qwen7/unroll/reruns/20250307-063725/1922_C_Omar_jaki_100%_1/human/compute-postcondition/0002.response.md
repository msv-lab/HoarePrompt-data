The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is non-zero, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `t` is the first integer from the split input by the lambda function `r()`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is non-zero.

State: **`t` must be non-zero, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers in strictly increasing order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, for each query, `x_i` and `y_i` are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i**
