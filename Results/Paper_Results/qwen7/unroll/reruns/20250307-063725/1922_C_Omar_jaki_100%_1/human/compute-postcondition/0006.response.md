Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `t`, an integer `n`, a list `a` of `n` integers in strictly increasing order, and multiple queries defined by pairs of integers `(x_i, y_i)`. For each query, it calculates and prints the difference between specific elements in an auxiliary array `b`, which is constructed based on the differences between consecutive elements in `a`. The final output consists of a series of these differences, printed according to the conditions specified in the queries.**
