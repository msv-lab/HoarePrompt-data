Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration where `n` and `s` are provided as inputs.

For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the program reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. If `n` equals 2, it checks if `s` is '00'. If `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. If the count of '1's is odd, it prints 'NO'. If there is exactly one occurrence of '11' in `s`, it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings corresponding to the results of each loop iteration, with no additional state variables being modified outside the loop.
