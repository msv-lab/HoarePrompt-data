You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are integers such that start <= end, and both represent valid directory names without leading zeros.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        if n == 2:
            if s == '00':
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            count_1 = s.count('1')
            if count_1 % 2 != 0:
                print('NO')
            elif s.count('11') == 1:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration where `n` and `s` are provided as inputs.
    #
    #For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the program reads an integer `n` and a string `s`. If `n` equals 2, it checks if `s` is '00'. If `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in `s`. If the count of '1's is odd, it prints 'NO'. If there is exactly one occurrence of '11' in `s`, it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
    #
    #The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings corresponding to the results of each loop iteration, with no additional state variables being modified outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It returns an error message if start is greater than end, and otherwise, it returns the range of directory names from start to end inclusive.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
