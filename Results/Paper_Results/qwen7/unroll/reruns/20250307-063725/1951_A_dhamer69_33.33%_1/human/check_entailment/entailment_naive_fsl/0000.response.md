Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program `func` does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a function `generate_files_for_html_in_range` which is supposed to generate `.py` files in specific directories based on the range of folder names. However, the given program `func` is a completely different function that performs a binary-like search on a string and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions. There is no function named `generate_files_for_html_in_range` in the provided code, and the logic inside `func` does not relate to the task described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
