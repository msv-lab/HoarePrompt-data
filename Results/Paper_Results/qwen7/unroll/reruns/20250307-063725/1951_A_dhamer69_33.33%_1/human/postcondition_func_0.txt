The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. If `n` is 2, it checks if `s` is '00'. If true, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is not 2, it checks if the count of '1's in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' in `s`. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. After processing all test cases, it outputs a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings corresponding to the results of each test case.
