Reasoning:
The given program `func()` is designed to process multiple test cases where each test case consists of an integer `n` followed by a string `s`. The program checks specific conditions based on the value of `n` and the content of `s` to determine whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'.

- If `n` is 2, the program checks if `s` is '00'. If `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- If `n` is not 2, the program checks if the number of '1's in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11' in `s`. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The provided execution summary accurately describes the behavior of the program. It correctly states that the program processes multiple test cases, checks the specified conditions, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on those conditions.

Given this analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
