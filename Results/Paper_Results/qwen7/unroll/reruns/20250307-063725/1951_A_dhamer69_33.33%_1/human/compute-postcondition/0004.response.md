Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It returns an error message if start is greater than end, and otherwise, it returns the range of directory names from start to end inclusive.**

This means the function does not take any parameters but checks if `start` is less than or equal to `end`. If `start` is greater than `end`, it returns an error message. Otherwise, it returns a sequence of directory names starting from `start` up to and including `end`.
