### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the analysis step by step:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. The implementation is correct and matches the standard algorithm.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is intended to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic inside the function does not correctly implement this condition. The current implementation calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\), and then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to the count `cnt`. This does not relate to the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and performs the above calculations. As mentioned, these calculations do not satisfy the required condition. The function `func_2` does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the above points, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function `func_2` does not implement the necessary logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly.
