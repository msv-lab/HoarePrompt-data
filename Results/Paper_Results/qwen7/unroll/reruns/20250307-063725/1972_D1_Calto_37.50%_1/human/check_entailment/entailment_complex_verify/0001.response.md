### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The implementation is accurate and correct.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The original assessment suggested that the function does not correctly implement the required condition. Let's verify this.

#### Main Logic:
- The main logic of the program should iterate over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\) and for each \(b\), iterate over possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- For each pair \((a, b)\), it should check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the current implementation in `func_2` does not do this. Instead, it uses a different logic:
- It calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\).
- It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to the count `cnt`.

This logic does not match the required conditions. Let's write the correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for b in range(1, m + 1):
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)
```

#### Correct Implementation Explanation:
- We iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
- For each \(b\), we iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
- We compute the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\) using `func_1`.
- We check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- If the condition is satisfied, we increment the count `cnt`.

Given the correct implementation, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
