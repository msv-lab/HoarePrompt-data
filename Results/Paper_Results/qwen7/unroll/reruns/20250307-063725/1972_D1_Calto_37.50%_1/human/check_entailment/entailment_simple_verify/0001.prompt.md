You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `a` and `b` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. In each iteration, `a` is replaced with `b`, and `b` is replaced with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we calculate `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we calculate `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`. Additionally, `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of the series where for each i from 1 to m-1, we calculate x = n - (i * i - i) and y = i * i, then add x // y + (i > 1) to cnt, given that cnt is not equal to 0.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and matches the standard Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic inside the function does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the current implementation does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\). It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to the count `cnt`.
   - This part of the code does not seem to be related to the problem statement. It appears to be an attempt to solve a different problem or a misinterpretation of the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_2` does not follow the required conditions and instead seems to be implementing a different logic.

### Correctness:
**False**

Correctness: **False**
