### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is implemented correctly and will work as expected.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - The function aims to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but its logic does not align with the problem statement.
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - These calculations do not seem to be related to the problem's constraints and conditions.
   - The condition `cnt == 0` and the return value of 1 for this case does not make sense in the context of counting valid pairs.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve the problem correctly, we should iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - For each pair \((a, b)\), compute \(\gcd(a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
False
