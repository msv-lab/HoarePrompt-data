Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main requirement of counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is correct but not used in the solution.
- `func_2` attempts to count valid pairs using a different approach that does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, it uses a formula that does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem description, valid pairs include \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\), and \((10, 3)\). This gives us 14 valid pairs.
- However, running the provided code for this test case results in an output of 14, which is correct in this specific case. But the implementation is flawed because it does not generalize correctly for all inputs.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The current implementation does not achieve this.
