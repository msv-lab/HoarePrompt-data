Output State: **The program returns the sum of the series where for each i from 1 to m-1, we calculate x = n - (i * i - i) and y = i * i, then add x // y + (i > 1) to cnt, given that cnt is not equal to 0.**

This means the program calculates the value of `cnt` as described in the initial state and returns it. The exact numerical value of `cnt` depends on the values of `n` and `m`, but since `cnt` is not equal to 0, the return value is guaranteed to be a non-zero integer.
