Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not accurately count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem statement. The logic within `func_2` appears to be attempting to solve a different problem, involving squares and divisions, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to iterate through all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within their respective ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). The provided `func_1` for calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) is correct, but it should be used within a properly implemented counting mechanism for the pairs.
