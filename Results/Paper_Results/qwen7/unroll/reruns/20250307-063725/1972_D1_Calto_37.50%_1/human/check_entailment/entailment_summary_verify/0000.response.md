Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it is not used in the main logic of the program.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function attempts to solve the problem but uses a different approach that does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates a series sum based on the formula \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\), adding \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to a counter `cnt` for each \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\). This approach does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Function Summary Analysis
The summary states that the function calculates a series sum based on the formula \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\), adding \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to a counter `cnt` for each \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\). If the counter `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum. This summary does not accurately describe the intended logic for solving the problem.

### Correct Implementation
A correct implementation would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is a potential correct implementation:

```python
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Evaluation
The original assessment states that the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the main requirement of counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, upon closer inspection, we see that `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic either. The provided code snippet has a flaw in its logic, and the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
