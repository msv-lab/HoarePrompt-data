Reasoning:
Let's analyze the given problem and the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Function 1 Analysis
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and necessary for solving the problem, but it is not directly used in the main function `func_2`.

### Function 2 Analysis
The function `func_2` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\). However, the current implementation does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the given code:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
    if cnt == 0:
        return 1
    return cnt
```

#### Issues with the Current Implementation
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside the loop does not match the problem statement. Specifically, the expressions `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i` do not relate to the conditions \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Range of `i`**: The loop runs from 1 to `m-1`, which means `b` ranges from 1 to `m-1`. However, the problem requires \(1 \leq b \leq m\), so this should include `m` as well.
3. **Counting Valid Pairs**: The current approach does not correctly count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given condition.

### Correct Approach
To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\) within the given ranges and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a

    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion
The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
