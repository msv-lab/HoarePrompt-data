State: **`cnt` is 0, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, m):` will start with `i` set to 1 and increment `i` until `i` is no longer less than `m`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start from 1 and `m` must be greater than 1.
4. The initial values of `cnt` and `n` do not affect the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `i` starts at 1 and `m` is greater than 1.
