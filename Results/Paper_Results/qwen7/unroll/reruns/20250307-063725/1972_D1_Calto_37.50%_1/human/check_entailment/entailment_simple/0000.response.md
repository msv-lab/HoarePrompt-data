Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 (func_1)**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The logic and implementation are correct.
2. **Function 2 (func_2)**: The provided code for `func_2` does not match the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not perform this calculation. Instead, it calculates a series involving \(i\) and \(n\), which is irrelevant to the problem's requirements.

Given the discrepancy between the problem statement and the implementation of `func_2`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
