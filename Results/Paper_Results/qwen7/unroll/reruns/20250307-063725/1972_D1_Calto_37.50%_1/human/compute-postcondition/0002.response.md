Output State: `cnt` is the sum of `x // y + (i > 1)` for each `i` in the range from 1 to `m-1`. Specifically, for each `i`, `x` is calculated as `n - (i * i - i)`, and `y` is `i * i`. The term `(i > 1)` evaluates to 1 if `i` is greater than 1 and 0 otherwise. This value is added to `cnt` in each iteration.
