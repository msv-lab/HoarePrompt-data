### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the problem and the provided code based on the given function summaries and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function Summaries Recap:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is correct.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: The function is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given conditions. However, the provided summary suggests a different logic which does not match the problem requirements.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the GCD.
   - No issues here.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function summary states that it calculates a series sum based on the formula \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\), adding \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to a counter `cnt` for each \(i\) from 1 to \(m-1\).
   - This logic does not align with the problem requirements. The problem requires checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\), but the function does not perform this check.

Given the discrepancy between the function summary and the problem requirements, we need to re-examine the logic in `func_2`.

#### Correct Implementation:
To correctly solve the problem, we should iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

Here is a corrected version of `func_2`:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

This implementation correctly checks each pair \((a, b)\) and counts those that satisfy the given condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The provided function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

Correctness: **False**
