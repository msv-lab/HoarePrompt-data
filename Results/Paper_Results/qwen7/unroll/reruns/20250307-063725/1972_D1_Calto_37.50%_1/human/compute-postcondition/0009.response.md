Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters. It calculates a series sum based on the formula \( x = n - (i^2 - i) \) and \( y = i^2 \), adding \( x // y + (i > 1) \) to a counter `cnt` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. If the counter `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.**
