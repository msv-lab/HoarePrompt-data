### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - It is not used in the main logic of solving the problem, so its presence is irrelevant to the correctness of the solution.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) but uses a different approach that does not align with the problem statement.
   - The logic inside `func_2` involves calculating \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), then adding \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to `cnt`.
   - This logic does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the states and logic flow.
- The function `func_2` iterates from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x\) and \(y\) based on \(i\).
- The expression \(x // y + (i > 1)\) is added to `cnt`, but this does not check the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Correct Implementation:
A correct implementation would involve:
1. Iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. For each pair, compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the pairs that satisfy the condition.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- Consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):
  - Valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\), and \((10, 3)\).
  - There are 14 valid pairs.
  - Running the provided code for this test case results in an output of 14, which is correct in this specific case.
- However, the implementation is flawed because it does not generalize correctly for all inputs. The logic inside `func_2` does not correctly handle the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
