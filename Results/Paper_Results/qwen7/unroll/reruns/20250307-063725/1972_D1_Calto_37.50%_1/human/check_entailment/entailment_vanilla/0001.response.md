Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The implementation is correct and matches the standard Euclidean algorithm for GCD calculation.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function is supposed to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic inside the function does not correctly implement the required condition. Specifically, the current implementation does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program iterates over possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m-1\) and calculates \(x = n - (i \cdot i - i)\) and \(y = i \cdot i\). It then adds \(x // y + (i > 1)\) to the count `cnt`.
   - This part of the code does not seem to be related to the problem statement. It appears to be an attempt to solve a different problem or a misinterpretation of the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The function `func_2` does not follow the required conditions and instead seems to be implementing a different logic.

### Correctness:
**False**

Correctness: **False**
