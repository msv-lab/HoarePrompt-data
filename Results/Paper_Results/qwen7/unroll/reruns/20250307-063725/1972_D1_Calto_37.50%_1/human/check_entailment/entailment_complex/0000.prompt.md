Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Annotated Functions:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a <= n and 1 <= b <= m.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: Output State: The values of `a` and `b` will be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
    #
    #Explanation: The given loop implements the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. In each iteration, `a` is replaced with `b`, and `b` is replaced with the remainder of `a` divided by `b` (`a % b`). This process continues until `b` becomes zero, at which point `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `a` and `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It calculates and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. After execution, `a` contains the GCD of the initial values of `a` and `b`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(1, m):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + x // y + (i > 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we calculate `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`.
    if (cnt == 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: `cnt` is the sum of the series where for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`, we calculate `x = n - (i * i - i)` and `y = i * i`, then add `x // y + (i > 1)` to `cnt`. Additionally, `cnt` is not equal to 0
    return cnt
    #The program returns the sum of the series where for each i from 1 to m-1, we calculate x = n - (i * i - i) and y = i * i, then add x // y + (i > 1) to cnt, given that cnt is not equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters. It calculates a series sum based on the formula \( x = n - (i^2 - i) \) and \( y = i^2 \), adding \( x // y + (i > 1) \) to a counter `cnt` for each `i` from 1 to `m-1`. If the counter `cnt` equals 0, the function returns 1; otherwise, it returns the calculated sum.
