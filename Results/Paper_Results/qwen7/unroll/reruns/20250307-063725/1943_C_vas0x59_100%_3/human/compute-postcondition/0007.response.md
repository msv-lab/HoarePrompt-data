Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input; `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `previous` is a variable containing the previous nodes information from the BFS, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

The code `d, previous = bfs(a)` executes the BFS algorithm on the graph represented by the adjacency list `a`. The BFS function returns two values: `d`, which is the result of the BFS starting from node 0 (representing the shortest path distances from the starting node), and `previous`, which contains information about the previous nodes in the BFS traversal. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as well as the list `u2vs` and the result of `func_1(d)`, which is stored in `a`.
