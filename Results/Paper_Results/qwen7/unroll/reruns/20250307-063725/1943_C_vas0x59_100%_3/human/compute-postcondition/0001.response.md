Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list of n empty lists, where each sublist is used to store the indices of vertices connected to vertex i. Since `n` is an input integer, its value remains unchanged. After executing the code, `u2vs` is updated to be a list containing `n` empty lists, meaning there are no connections defined for any vertex yet.
