Output State: `n` is an input integer; `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input. Each pair `(u, v)` received from input is added to both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]`, considering `u` and `v` are zero-indexed.
