Based on the initial state provided:

- `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 (using integer division).
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `0` as determined by the BFS algorithm.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input.
- `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node `0`.
- `previous` contains the previous nodes information from the BFS.
- `a` and `b` are both results of `func_1(d)`.
- `ops` is either a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, where `c` is the element at index `ci` of `path_ba`, or a list containing tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci` with a step of 2, where `c1` and `c2` are elements at indices `ci` and `ci-1` of `path_ba` respectively.

Given this, let's break down the `print` statement:

```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

This statement maps over the `ops` list and formats each tuple `(c, i)` into a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`. The `+1` is added to convert the node index to a 1-based index. The `*` operator unpacks the mapped iterable into positional arguments for the `print` function, and `sep='\n'` ensures each formatted string is printed on a new line.

Let's consider both possible structures for `ops`:

1. If `ops` is a list of tuples `(c, i)` for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive:
   - Each tuple will be of the form `(path_ba[ci], i)`.
   - The output will be a series of lines, each containing `path_ba[ci] + 1` followed by `i + 1`.

2. If `ops` is a list of tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci` with a step of 2:
   - Each tuple will be of the form `(path_ba[ci], i)` and `(path_ba[ci-1], i)`.
   - The output will be a series of lines, each containing `path_ba[ci] + 1` followed by `i + 1`, and then `path_ba[ci-1] + 1` followed by `i + 1`.

In both cases, the output will be a series of lines where each line contains two numbers separated by a space, representing the node index (converted to 1-based index) and the corresponding position `i` in the `path_ba`.

Output: **path_ba[ci] + 1 path_ba[ci] + 1\n... (repeated for each tuple in ops)**
