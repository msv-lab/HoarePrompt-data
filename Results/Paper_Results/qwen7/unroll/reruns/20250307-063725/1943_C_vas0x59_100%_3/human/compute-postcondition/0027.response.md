Output State: `ci2` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 minus 1, `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `0` as determined by the BFS algorithm, `n` remains an input integer, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input, `d` remains the result of the BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` remains a variable containing the previous nodes information from the BFS, `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` remains the result of `func_1(d)`, and `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci1 - 1` with a step of 2, where `c1` and `c2` are elements at specific indices of `path_ba`.
