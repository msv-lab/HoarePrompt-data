The function reads an integer `n` and a list of edges for a tree with `n` vertices. It then constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree. After that, it performs two breadth-first searches (BFS) to find a specific node `a` and then the shortest path from `a` back to the root node `0`. Based on the length of this path, it constructs a list of operations (pairs of node indices and integers) and prints the count of these operations followed by the operations themselves. The function returns nothing.
