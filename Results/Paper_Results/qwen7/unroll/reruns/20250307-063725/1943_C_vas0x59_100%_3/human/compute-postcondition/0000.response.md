Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of lists where u2vs[i] contains the indices of vertices connected to vertex i**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `u2vs` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `n` and retains the original description of `u2vs`.
