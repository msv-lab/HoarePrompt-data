Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input; `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `_` is the second return value of the BFS which is discarded.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` calls the `bfs` function with the starting node `0`. The `bfs` function performs a breadth-first search and returns two values: the distance array `d` and a second value `_` (which is typically used for returning multiple values but is not needed here). The distance array `d` contains the shortest distance from the starting node to every other node in the graph. The other variables remain unchanged.
