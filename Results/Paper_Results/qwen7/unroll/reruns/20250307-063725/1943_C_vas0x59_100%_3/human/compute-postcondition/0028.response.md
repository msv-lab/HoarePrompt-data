Output State: **ci2 is the length of path_ba divided by 2 minus 1, path_ba is a list containing the shortest path from node b back to node 0, n remains an input integer, u2vs remains a list of n empty lists where each list at index u contains its adjacent indices v after processing all the edges from standard input, d remains the result of the BFS starting from node 0, previous remains a variable containing the previous nodes information from the BFS, a remains the result of func_1(d), b remains the result of func_1(d), ops is a list containing [(c1, i), (c2, i)] for each i in the range 1 to len(path_ba) - ci1 with a step of 2, c2 is the element at index ci2 of path_ba.**
