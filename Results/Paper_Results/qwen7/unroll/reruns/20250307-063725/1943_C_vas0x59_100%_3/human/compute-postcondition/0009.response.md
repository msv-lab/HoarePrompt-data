Output State: **`b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `previous` is a variable containing the previous nodes information from the BFS, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the single element `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This means `path_ba` now contains only the element `b`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
