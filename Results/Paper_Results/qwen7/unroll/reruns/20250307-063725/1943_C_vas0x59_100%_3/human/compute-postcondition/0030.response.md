Based on the initial state provided:

- `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 (using integer division).
- `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `0` as determined by the BFS algorithm.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input.
- `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node `0`.
- `previous` contains the previous nodes information from the BFS.
- `a` and `b` are both the result of `func_1(d)`.
- `ops` is either:
  - A list containing tuples `(c, i)` for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, where `c` is the element at index `ci` of `path_ba`.
  - A list containing tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci` with a step of 2, where `c1` and `c2` are elements at indices `ci` and `ci-1` of `path_ba` respectively.

The `print(len(ops))` statement will print the length of the list `ops`.

To determine the length of `ops`, we need to consider both possible definitions of `ops`:

1. If `ops` is a list containing tuples `(c, i)` for `i` in the range from `0` to `ci` inclusive, then the length of `ops` is `ci + 1`.
2. If `ops` is a list containing tuples `[(c1, i), (c2, i)]` for each `i` in the range 1 to `len(path_ba) - ci` with a step of 2, then the length of `ops` is `(len(path_ba) - ci) / 2`.

Since `ci` is the length of `path_ba` divided by 2 (integer division), let's denote the length of `path_ba` as `L`. Therefore, `ci = L // 2`.

For the first case:
- Length of `ops` = `ci + 1 = L // 2 + 1`.

For the second case:
- Length of `ops` = `(L - ci) / 2 = (L - (L // 2)) / 2 = (L / 2) / 2 = L / 4`.

Given the two possible definitions, the length of `ops` could be either `L // 2 + 1` or `L / 4`, depending on the specific structure of `path_ba`.

However, since the problem does not specify which definition of `ops` applies, we must consider both possibilities. But typically, the first definition (`ci + 1`) is more common in such contexts unless otherwise specified.

Therefore, the most precise answer would be based on the first definition.

Output: **L // 2 + 1 (where L is the length of path_ba)**
