Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `0` as determined by the BFS algorithm, and `n` remains an input integer, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input, `d` remains the result of the BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` remains a variable containing the previous nodes information from the BFS, `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`, and `b` remains the result of `func_1(d)`.

The loop continues to follow the `previous` pointers from the last node in `path_ba` until it reaches `-1`, indicating no further path exists, at which point the loop breaks. The final `path_ba` will be the shortest path from the node `b` (which is the same as `a` and the result of `func_1(d)`) back to the starting node `0`.
