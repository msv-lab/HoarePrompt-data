Postcondition: **`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node `b` back to node `0` as determined by the BFS algorithm, `n` remains an input integer, `u2vs` remains a list of `n` empty lists where each list at index `u` contains its adjacent indices `v` after processing all the edges from standard input, `d` remains the result of the BFS starting from node `0`, `previous` remains a variable containing the previous nodes information from the BFS, `a` remains the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` remains the result of `func_1(d)`, and `ops` is an empty list. The length of `path_ba` is odd.**
