Output State: The output state will consist of a series of rounded results printed during each iteration of the loop, with a total of `n` such results.

Explanation: The loop runs `n` times, each time processing four coordinate pairs provided by the user. After sorting these coordinates, it calculates the Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and between the third and fourth points. It then multiplies the square roots of these distances to get `res`, which is printed and rounded. This process repeats `n` times, decrementing `n` by 1 after each iteration until `n` becomes 0. Thus, the final output state will be a list of `n` rounded numerical values representing the calculated distances for each set of four coordinates.
