Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `n`. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero (`n > 0`).

2. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `s` is the sum of \((l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2\) for each `l` entered.
   - `n` is decremented by 1 for each iteration of the while loop.

3. **Adjusting the State**:
   - The only variable in the loop head is `n`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be greater than 0.

### Conclusion:
Since `n` is the only variable in the loop head and it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
