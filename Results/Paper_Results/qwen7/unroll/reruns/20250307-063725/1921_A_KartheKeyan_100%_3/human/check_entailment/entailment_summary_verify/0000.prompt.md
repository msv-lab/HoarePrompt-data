You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of square coordinates provided by the user. For each set of coordinates, it calculates the Euclidean distance between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, multiplies these distances, takes the square root of the product, and prints the rounded result. This process repeats for `n` sets of coordinates, where `n` is the initial value provided by the user. The final output consists of a list of `n` integers, each representing the rounded result of the distance product calculation for each set of coordinates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distances between certain pairs of points. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the calculated distance will correspond to the side length of the square. Specifically, the program calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two points and then takes the square root of the product of these distances, which does not necessarily give the side length of the square.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

The correct side length of the square is 28 (the difference between 45 and 17), but the program incorrectly calculates the side length as follows:

1. Calculate \( p1 = (45 - 17)^2 + (11 - 11)^2 = 28^2 + 0 = 784 \).
2. Calculate \( p2 = (45 - 17)^2 + (39 - 39)^2 = 28^2 + 0 = 784 \).
3. The side length is then calculated as \( \sqrt{784} \times \sqrt{784} = 28 \times 28 = 784 \).

This calculation is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual side length of the square. The correct approach would be to find the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points, which would give the side length of the square.

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
