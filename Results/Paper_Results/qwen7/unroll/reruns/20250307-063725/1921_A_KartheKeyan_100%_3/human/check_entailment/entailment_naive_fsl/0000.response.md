Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distances between certain pairs of points. However, this approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that the calculated distance will correspond to the side length of the square. Specifically, the program calculates the squared Euclidean distance between two points and then takes the square root of the product of these distances, which does not necessarily give the side length of the square.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following input:

```
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

The correct side length of the square is 28 (the difference between 45 and 17), but the program incorrectly calculates the side length as follows:

1. Calculate \( p1 = (45 - 17)^2 + (11 - 11)^2 = 28^2 + 0 = 784 \).
2. Calculate \( p2 = (45 - 17)^2 + (39 - 39)^2 = 28^2 + 0 = 784 \).
3. The side length is then calculated as \( \sqrt{784} \times \sqrt{784} = 28 \times 28 = 784 \).

This calculation is incorrect because it does not reflect the actual side length of the square. The correct approach would be to find the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among the four points, which would give the side length of the square.

Therefore, the program does not correctly calculate the area of the square for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
