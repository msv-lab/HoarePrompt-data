You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t such sets of coordinates, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of rounded results from the calculation of the Euclidean distance product between two pairs of points, repeated for each iteration of the while loop until `n` reaches 0.
    #
    #Each iteration of the loop processes four coordinates input by the user, sorts them, calculates the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, then computes the square root of these distances multiplied together. The result is printed and rounded to the nearest integer. This process repeats `n` times, decrementing `n` by 1 after each iteration.
    #
    #The final output state will be a list of `n` integers, each representing the rounded result of the distance product calculation for each set of four coordinates provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and processes t sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i), where each set represents the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each set, it returns whether the squares overlap or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
