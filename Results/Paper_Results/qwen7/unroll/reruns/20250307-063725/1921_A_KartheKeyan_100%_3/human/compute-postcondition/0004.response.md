Output State: The output state will consist of a series of rounded results from the calculation of the Euclidean distance product between two pairs of points, repeated for each iteration of the while loop until `n` reaches 0.

Each iteration of the loop processes four coordinates input by the user, sorts them, calculates the squared Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, then computes the square root of these distances multiplied together. The result is printed and rounded to the nearest integer. This process repeats `n` times, decrementing `n` by 1 after each iteration.

The final output state will be a list of `n` integers, each representing the rounded result of the distance product calculation for each set of four coordinates provided by the user during the respective iteration of the loop.
