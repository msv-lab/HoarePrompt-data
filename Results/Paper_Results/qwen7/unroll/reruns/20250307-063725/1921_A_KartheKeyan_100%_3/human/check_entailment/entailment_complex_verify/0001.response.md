### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Coordinate Collection**:
   - It collects the coordinates of the four corners of the square into a list `coord`. This part is also correct.

3. **Sorting Coordinates**:
   - The coordinates are sorted, but sorting them does not necessarily help in identifying the sides of the square. Sorting might not be the best approach here since the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the axes. However, sorting is not essential for the correct solution.

4. **Distance Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the squared distances between pairs of points. Specifically, it calculates the distance between the first and second points (`p1`) and between the third and fourth points (`p2`). This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that these points are adjacent vertices of the square. Instead, the correct approach should be to find the maximum difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates between any two points, as these differences will give the side length of the square.

5. **Area Calculation**:
   - The area is calculated as the product of the square roots of the distances `p1` and `p2`. This calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the distances represent the side lengths of the square, which is not guaranteed by the current logic.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the points might not be in a specific order or might not form a square perfectly due to floating-point precision issues. However, since the problem guarantees a square with sides parallel to the axes, this is less of an issue.

### Correct Approach:
- A more robust method would involve identifying the side length of the square directly. Given that the square's sides are parallel to the axes, we can calculate the differences in x-coordinates and y-coordinates between the points. The maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates will give us the side length of the square.

### Revised Program:
```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the maximum difference in x and y coordinates
        max_diff_x = max(coord)[0] - min(coord)[0]
        max_diff_y = max(coord, key=lambda p: p[1])[1] - min(coord, key=lambda p: p[1])[1]
        
        # The side length of the square is the maximum of the differences
        side_length = max(max_diff_x, max_diff_y)
        
        # Calculate the area
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)
        
        n -= 1

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has logical flaws and does not correctly identify the side length of the square. The revised program correctly identifies the side length by finding the maximum difference in x-coordinates and y-coordinates between any two points. Therefore, the original program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
