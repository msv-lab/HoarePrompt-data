The function processes a series of square coordinates provided by the user. For each set of coordinates, it calculates the Euclidean distance between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, multiplies these distances, takes the square root of the product, and prints the rounded result. This process repeats for `n` sets of coordinates, where `n` is the initial value provided by the user. The final output consists of a list of `n` integers, each representing the rounded result of the distance product calculation for each set of coordinates.
