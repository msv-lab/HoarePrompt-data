Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and processes t sets of coordinates (x_i, y_i), where each set represents the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. For each set, it returns whether the squares overlap or not.**

This means the function will take in no direct parameters but will process multiple sets of coordinates provided through its input, determine if any of the squares defined by these coordinates overlap, and return a result for each set indicating whether an overlap exists.
