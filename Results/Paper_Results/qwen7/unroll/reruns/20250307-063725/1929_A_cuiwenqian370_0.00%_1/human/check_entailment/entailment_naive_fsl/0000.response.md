Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in how the `new_arr` is constructed within the `func_1` function. Specifically, the sorting and pairing of elements does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program outputs `2`. Here's why:

- After sorting, `arr` becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
- The pairs formed are `(3, 3)` and `(3, 4)`.
- The beauty calculation is `abs(3 - 3) + abs(3 - 4) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

However, the correct approach would be to sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences. For the given example, the correct pairs should be `(3, 4)` and `(3, 3)`, resulting in a beauty of `abs(4 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) = 1 + 0 = 1`.

To fix this, the program should sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements iteratively. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left < right:
        max_beauty += abs(arr[right] - arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected function ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by always taking the difference between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
