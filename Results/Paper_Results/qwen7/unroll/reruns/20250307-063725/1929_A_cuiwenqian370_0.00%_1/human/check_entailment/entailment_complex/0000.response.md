Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. The annotated program correctly sorts the array `arr` and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr` are maximized because the smallest and largest elements are placed next to each other, leading to the largest possible differences.

3. After constructing `new_arr`, the program calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which gives the maximum beauty of the array.

4. The logic in the `func_1` function is sound and correctly implements the strategy to maximize the beauty of the array by alternating between the smallest and largest elements.

5. The program correctly handles the input and output as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct in terms of both logic and implementation.

Correctness: **True**
