Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `left` to 0. The values of `arr` and `new_arr` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `arr` is still a sorted list of n integers within the specified range, and `new_arr` remains an empty list. The only new information is that `left` is now set to 0.
