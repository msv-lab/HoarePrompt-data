Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by sorting the array and then constructing a new array `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This approach aims to maximize the beauty of the array by ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. However, the logic in the `func_1` function is flawed because it does not correctly alternate between the smallest and largest elements to achieve the maximum possible beauty.

Here's why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Sorting and Alternation**: The code sorts the array `arr` and then tries to create `new_arr` by appending elements from both ends of the sorted array. This does not guarantee that the maximum beauty is achieved. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the alternation process would give `[1, 4, 2, 3]`. The beauty would be `(4-1) + (3-2) = 4`, but the optimal solution should be `(4-1) + (3-2) = 4`, which is already correct, but the method of alternation might not always work as expected for other arrays.

2. **Correct Approach**: To maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest and largest elements together. A better approach would be to sort the array and then pair the first element with the last, the second with the second last, and so on. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Given these points, the current implementation does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
