Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `right`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged, `new_arr` remains an empty list, and `left` remains 0.
