Reasoning:

1. The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. The given solution sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements to form a new array. However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array. The key insight is that to maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the positive differences (when the larger element comes after the smaller one) are maximized and the negative differences (when the smaller element comes after the larger one) are minimized.

3. Let's analyze the logic of the provided solution:
   - Sorting the array allows us to easily pick the smallest and largest elements.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest elements, the solution does not ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized. Instead, it pairs the smallest and largest elements together, which might not always yield the maximum beauty.

4. To illustrate, consider the sorted array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The new array formed by the provided solution would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`. The beauty would be `(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-4) = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5`. However, the optimal pairing would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` but in a different order to maximize the beauty. The correct order should be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` but ensuring the differences are maximized, which would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]` but in a way that the differences are `4 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 9`.

5. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty. It only alternates between the smallest and largest elements without ensuring the maximum possible differences.

6. The example cases in the problem statement are not correctly handled by the given solution. For instance, in the test case `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the provided solution would produce a new array `[100, 43, 80, 54, 90]` with a beauty of `57`, but the optimal solution would be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]` with a beauty of `107`.

Final: **False**
