You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and 100, and `arr`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. It sorts the list `arr`. Then, it creates a new list `new_arr` containing every second element from the original `arr`, starting from the first and last elements respectively, until the middle of the list. Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The issue lies in how the `new_arr` is constructed within the `func_1` function. Specifically, the sorting and pairing of elements does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty. 

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program outputs `2`. Here's why:

- After sorting, `arr` becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
- The pairs formed are `(3, 3)` and `(3, 4)`.
- The beauty calculation is `abs(3 - 3) + abs(3 - 4) = 0 + 1 = 1`.

However, the correct approach would be to sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements to maximize the differences. For the given example, the correct pairs should be `(3, 4)` and `(3, 3)`, resulting in a beauty of `abs(4 - 3) + abs(3 - 3) = 1 + 0 = 1`.

To fix this, the program should sort the array and then pair the smallest and largest elements iteratively. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left < right:
        max_beauty += abs(arr[right] - arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected function ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly by always taking the difference between the largest and smallest remaining elements.
