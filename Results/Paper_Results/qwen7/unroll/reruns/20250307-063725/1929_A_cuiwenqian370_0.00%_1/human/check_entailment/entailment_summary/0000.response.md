Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum possible beauty of an array after rearranging its elements.
2. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
3. The provided solution involves sorting the array and then creating a new array by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
4. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements in the new array are maximized, which aligns with the goal of maximizing the beauty.
5. The logic in `func_1` correctly implements this strategy:
   - It sorts the array.
   - It constructs a new array by alternately taking the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - It then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.
6. The code handles multiple test cases as expected, reading the number of test cases, processing each one, and printing the results.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
