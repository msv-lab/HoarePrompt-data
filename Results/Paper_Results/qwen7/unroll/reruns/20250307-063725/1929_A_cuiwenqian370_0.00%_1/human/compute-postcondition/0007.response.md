Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n`. This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` should be set to 1 initially.

4. **Determine the initial state of `n`**: The value of `n` is not explicitly given in the state before the loop. However, since the loop runs as long as `i < n`, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

5. **Consider other variables**: The variables `new_arr` and `max_beauty` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. Specifically, `i` should be set to 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
