Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and \(10^9\). After sorting, the list `arr` will contain the same integers as before but in sorted order. The range of values for each element in the list remains the same, and the value of `n` is unchanged.
