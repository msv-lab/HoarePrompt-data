Output State: **new_arr is a list containing every second element from the original arr, starting from the first and last elements respectively, until the middle of the list; max_beauty is 0**.

Explanation: The line `max_beauty = 0` initializes the variable `max_beauty` to 0. This does not affect the content of `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` remains unchanged as described in the initial state, and `max_beauty` is set to 0.
