### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Analysis of the Given Program:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes the size of the array (`n`) and the array (`arr`) as inputs.
   - It first sorts the array (`arr.sort()`).
   - It then constructs a new array (`new_arr`) by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements from the sorted array.
   - Finally, it calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

#### Key Points to Consider:

- **Sorting and Pairing:**
  - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are considered first when forming pairs.
  - The original implementation constructs `new_arr` by appending elements from both ends of the sorted array alternately. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty because it doesn't ensure that the smallest and largest elements are paired together.

- **Correct Approach:**
  - To maximize the beauty, we should pair the smallest and largest elements iteratively.
  - The corrected function provided in the original assessment correctly pairs the smallest and largest elements by iterating through the sorted array from both ends.

#### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
  - `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\).

- **After Sorting:**
  - `arr` is sorted, so the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.

- **Constructing `new_arr`:**
  - The original implementation constructs `new_arr` by alternating between the smallest and largest elements, which may not always yield the maximum beauty.

- **Beauty Calculation:**
  - The original implementation calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
  - The corrected implementation pairs the smallest and largest elements iteratively, ensuring that the maximum possible differences are used.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array due to the flawed construction of `new_arr`. The corrected version provided in the original assessment ensures that the maximum beauty is achieved by pairing the smallest and largest elements iteratively.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly construct `new_arr` to maximize the beauty. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is necessary to achieve the correct solution.
