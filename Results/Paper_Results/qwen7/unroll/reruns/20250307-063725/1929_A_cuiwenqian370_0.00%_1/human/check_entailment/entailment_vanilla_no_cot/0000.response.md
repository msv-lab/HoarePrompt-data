Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The issue lies in how the `new_arr` is constructed in the `func_1` function. The current approach alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here's the corrected implementation:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(arr[i] - arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

This corrected version sorts the array and calculates the beauty directly without needing to construct a new array. This approach ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, leading to the correct maximum beauty of the array.
