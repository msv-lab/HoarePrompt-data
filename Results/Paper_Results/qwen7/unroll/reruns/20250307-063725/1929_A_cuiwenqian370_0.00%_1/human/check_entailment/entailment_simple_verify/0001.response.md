### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Given Solution**: The solution sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements to form a new array. This approach aims to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

#### Analysis of the Code:

- **Sorting the Array**: The array is sorted, which is a good start because it allows us to easily pick the smallest and largest elements.
- **Alternating Elements**: The code alternates between the smallest and largest elements to form a new array. However, the implementation has a flaw:
  - When `left` equals `right`, only the last element is appended to `new_arr`.
  - The loop should continue even when `left` equals `right` to ensure all elements are considered.

#### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Initial State**: `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `arr` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer is in the range \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\).
- **Sorting**: `arr.sort()` sorts the array in ascending order.
- **Forming `new_arr`**: The code alternates between the smallest and largest elements, but the logic for handling the case when `left` equals `right` is flawed. Specifically, the loop should continue appending elements even when `left` equals `right`.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
while left <= right:
    if left == right:
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    else:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
        new_arr.append(arr[left])
    left += 1
    right -= 1
```
- If `left` equals `right`, the current element is added to `new_arr`, but the loop should continue to append the next element (which is the same as the current one).

#### Correct Implementation:

To fix this, the loop should continue even when `left` equals `right`:
```python
while left <= right:
    new_arr.append(arr[left])
    if left != right:
        new_arr.append(arr[right])
    left += 1
    right -= 1
```

#### Conclusion:

The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the code does not correctly handle the case when `left` equals `right`. The logic for forming `new_arr` is flawed, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
