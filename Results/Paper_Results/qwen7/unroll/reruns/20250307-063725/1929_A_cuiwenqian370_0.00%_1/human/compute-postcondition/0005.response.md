Output State: **new_arr is a list containing every second element from the original arr, starting from the first and last elements respectively, until the middle of the list.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through the sorted list `arr` from both ends towards the center. When `left` equals `right`, it means there's only one element left, so it's appended directly. Otherwise, it appends the elements at the `right` index (last remaining) and then the `left` index (first remaining), effectively creating a new list with elements interleaved from the start and end of the original list.
