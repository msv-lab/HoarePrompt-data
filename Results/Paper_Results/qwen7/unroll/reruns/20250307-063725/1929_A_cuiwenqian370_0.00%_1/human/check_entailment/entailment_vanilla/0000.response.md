Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. The given solution sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements to form a new array. This approach aims to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - Sorting the array allows us to easily pick the smallest and largest elements.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest elements, we ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - For example, if the sorted array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the new array formed would be `[1, 5, 2, 4, 3]`. The beauty would be `(5-1) + (4-2) + (3-4) = 4 + 2 - 1 = 5`.
4. The code correctly implements this logic:
   - It sorts the array.
   - It alternates between the smallest and largest elements to form a new array.
   - It calculates the beauty of the new array by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
5. The code handles multiple test cases as required, processing each one separately and storing the results.
6. The example cases in the problem statement are correctly handled by the given solution, as demonstrated in the provided outputs.

Correctness: **True**
