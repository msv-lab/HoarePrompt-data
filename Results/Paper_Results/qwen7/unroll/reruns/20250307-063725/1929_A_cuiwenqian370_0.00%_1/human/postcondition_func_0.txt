The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 2 and 100, and `arr`, a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9. It sorts the list `arr`. Then, it creates a new list `new_arr` containing every second element from the original `arr`, starting from the first and last elements respectively, until the middle of the list. Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.
