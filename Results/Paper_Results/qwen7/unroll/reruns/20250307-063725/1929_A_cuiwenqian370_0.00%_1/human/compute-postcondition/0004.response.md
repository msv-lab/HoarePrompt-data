Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while left <= right`. The variables involved here are `left` and `right`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

3. **Current States Before the Loop**:
   - `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.
   - `new_arr` is an empty list.
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is `n - 1`.

4. **Check the Condition `left <= right`**:
   - Currently, `left` is 0.
   - Currently, `right` is `n - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `left <= right` must be true.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `left` is 0 and `right` is `n - 1`, the condition `left <= right` is already satisfied.
   - No adjustments are needed for `left` or `right` because they are already set up correctly for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is n - 1**
