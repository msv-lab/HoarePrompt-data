State right before the while loop: `t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).

The loop condition is `t > 0`. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be greater than 0.

Given that `t` is assigned the value of an integer input, and this integer is guaranteed to be between 1 and \(10^4\), the value of `t` will always be greater than 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the state of `t` to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive)**
