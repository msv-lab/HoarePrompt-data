### Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case.
2. **Charge Calculation**: For each test case, the function correctly calculates the remaining charge `f` after considering the time intervals between messages and the cost of turning the phone off and on.
3. **Turning Off and On**: The function uses `min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` to decide whether it is more cost-effective to send the message immediately or to turn the phone off and on. This logic is sound because:
   - If the charge loss during the interval is less than the cost of turning off and on, it is cheaper to send the message directly.
   - Otherwise, it is cheaper to turn the phone off and on.
4. **Final Charge Check**: After processing all messages, the function checks if the final charge `f` is greater than 0. If it is, the function prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as the initial charge, the cost of turning off and on, and the intervals between messages correctly.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to be correct according to the problem description.
