Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the remaining value of `f` after processing the list `ls`.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the program reads new values for `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `ls`. It then iterates through the list starting from the second element, updating `f` by subtracting the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`) for moving from one position to the next. If `f` is still greater than 0 after processing the entire list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the initial value provided by the user.
