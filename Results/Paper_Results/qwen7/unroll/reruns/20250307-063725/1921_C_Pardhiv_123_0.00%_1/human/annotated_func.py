#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. Additionally, a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n is provided where 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1} for all i.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses based on the evaluation of each iteration of the loop.
    #
    #Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. Inside the loop, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` are read from user input but are not modified within the loop. The loop calculates the remaining value of `f` after subtracting the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`) for each segment of the list `ls`. If `f` is greater than 0 after processing all segments, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process repeats until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers \( t \), \( n \), \( f \), and \( a \), \( b \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n \). It then calculates the remaining value of \( f \) after subtracting the minimum cost for each segment of the list \( m \). If \( f \) is greater than 0 after processing all segments, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process repeats \( t \) times. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of "YES" or "NO" responses.
