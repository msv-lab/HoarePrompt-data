Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it calculates the remaining charge after each message is sent. Specifically, the line `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)` is incorrect because it doesn't properly account for the charge consumed between messages and the cost of turning the phone off and on.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the charge and the previous time
        charge = f
        prev_time = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            # Calculate the charge consumed during the interval [prev_time, ls[i])
            charge -= a * (ls[i] - prev_time)
            
            # If the charge is already less than 0, return NO
            if charge <= 0:
                print("NO")
                break
            
            # Add the cost of turning off and on the phone
            charge -= b
            
            # Update the previous time
            prev_time = ls[i]
        
        # If we have gone through all messages without running out of charge, print YES
        else:
            print("YES")
        
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the phone's charge is correctly updated for each interval between messages and accounts for the cost of turning the phone off and on.
