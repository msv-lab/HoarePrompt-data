Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, constrained to be an integer between 1 and 10^4, while the other variables and the list `m` retain their initial conditions.
