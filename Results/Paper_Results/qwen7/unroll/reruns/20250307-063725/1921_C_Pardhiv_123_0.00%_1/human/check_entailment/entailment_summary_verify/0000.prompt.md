You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, len(ls)):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads four integers \( t \), \( n \), \( f \), and \( a \), \( b \), followed by a list of \( n \) integers \( m_1, m_2, \ldots, m_n \). It then calculates the remaining value of \( f \) after subtracting the minimum cost for each segment of the list \( m \). If \( f \) is greater than 0 after processing all segments, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process repeats \( t \) times. After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of "YES" or "NO" responses.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge becomes zero or negative during the process of sending messages. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that once the phone's charge reaches zero, it cannot send any more messages until it is recharged, which is not allowed in this problem.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 10 1 5
1 5 10
```
- Initially, the phone has 10 units of charge.
- From moment 0 to moment 1, the charge decreases by 1 unit, leaving 9 units.
- From moment 1 to moment 5, the charge decreases by 4 units (since \(5 - 1 = 4\) and \(4 \times 1 = 4\)), leaving 5 units.
- From moment 5 to moment 10, the charge decreases by 5 units (since \(10 - 5 = 5\) and \(5 \times 1 = 5\)), leaving 0 units.

At this point, the phone's charge is exactly 0, and the program would incorrectly continue to attempt to send the next message, which is at moment 10. However, since the charge is 0, it is impossible to send the message at moment 10. The program should stop and return "NO" when the charge reaches 0, but it does not do so.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the scenario where the phone's charge becomes 0 or negative.
