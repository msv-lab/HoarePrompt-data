Output State: The output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses based on the evaluation of each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1. Inside the loop, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` are read from user input but are not modified within the loop. The loop calculates the remaining value of `f` after subtracting the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`) for each segment of the list `ls`. If `f` is greater than 0 after processing all segments, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process repeats until `t` becomes 0, at which point the loop terminates.
