Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index where arr[i] != arr[i + 1] or len(arr) - 1 if such index does not exist.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: j is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means that `j` will keep moving towards the start of the array until it either reaches the beginning (index 0) or finds an element that is different from its predecessor. At the end of the loop, `j` will point to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or it will be at index 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `j` is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same. Additionally, the first element `arr[0]` is not equal to the last element `arr[-1]`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0. Here, n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is also 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].
