### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It uses two while loops to find the first position `i` where the elements start differing and the last position `j` where the elements start differing from the end.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it calculates the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0, which gives the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it calculates the minimum of `n - i - 1` and `j`, which gives the minimum length of the subarray that needs to be changed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire array might already be uniform (all elements are the same).
   - It also handles cases where the array might be uniform except for the beginning or the end.
   - However, there are some edge cases that the function does not handle properly:
     - When the array has multiple segments that need to be changed, the function only considers the first and last differing positions.
     - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`. The function would find `i = 0` and `j = 5`, but the optimal solution involves changing the middle segment `[2, 3, 4, 5]` to either `1` or `5`, which requires fewer operations.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost required to make all elements equal, but it does not always find the global minimum cost. It only considers the first and last differing positions, which may not be the optimal solution.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios including uniform arrays, non-uniform arrays, and arrays with differing segments at the beginning and end.
   - However, the test cases do not include examples where the optimal solution involves multiple segments being changed.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not always find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. It only considers the first and last differing positions, which may not be the optimal solution in cases with multiple segments needing to be changed.
