Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for the number of test cases (`t`) and for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`). This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through the array to find the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i+1]`, or `len(arr) - 1` if all elements are the same.
   - It then iterates through the array from the end to find the first index `j` where `arr[j]` is not equal to `arr[j-1]`, or `0` if all elements are the same.
   - The logic to determine the minimum cost to make all elements equal is correct. The function calculates the cost of two possible operations:
     - Changing all elements from index `i` to `len(arr) - 1` to `arr[i]`.
     - Changing all elements from `0` to `j - 1` to `arr[j]`.
   - The function returns the minimum of these two costs, which ensures the minimum number of burles needed to make all elements equal.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements are the same, the function correctly returns `0`.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, the function correctly calculates the cost of changing the entire array except the segment between `i` and `j`.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the function correctly calculates the cost of changing the segments from `i` to the end and from `0` to `j - 1`.

Given the above analysis, the program logic is sound and handles all specified cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
