Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all possible cases correctly.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 1
4
1 1 1 1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
2
0
4
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
0
0
```

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. It only considers the first and last elements of the array and does not account for the possibility of having multiple segments of different values that need to be unified. The function should find the minimum cost to unify the entire array into a single value, which requires considering all unique values in the array and determining the optimal segment to change.

A correct approach would involve identifying the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculating the cost of unifying the array to either the minimum or maximum value, whichever results in the lower cost.
