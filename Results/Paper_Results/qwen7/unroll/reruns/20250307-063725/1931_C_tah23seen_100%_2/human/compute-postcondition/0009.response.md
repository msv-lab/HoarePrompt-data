Output State: **The program returns 0**

Explanation: Given the initial state, `j` is 0 because `arr[0]` is equal to `arr[-1]`, meaning all elements in the array are the same. The expression `max(j - i - 1, 0)` becomes `max(0 - i - 1, 0)`. Since `i` is not defined in the provided state, we consider the general case where `i` would be 0 (as it typically represents an index starting from 0). Thus, the expression simplifies to `max(-1, 0)`, which results in 0.
