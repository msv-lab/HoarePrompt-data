Output State: j is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same.

Explanation: The loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means that `j` will keep moving towards the start of the array until it either reaches the beginning (index 0) or finds an element that is different from its predecessor. At the end of the loop, `j` will point to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or it will be at index 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
