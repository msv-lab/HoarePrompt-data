Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the size of the array `n` and the array itself. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It then uses two while loops to find the first index `i` where the current element differs from the next one and the first index `j` from the end where the current element differs from the previous one.
   - After finding these indices, it checks if the first and last elements are the same. If they are, it returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`, which is the cost to make all elements equal using a single operation.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`, which is the minimum cost to make all elements equal using a single operation.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all elements in the array are the same, both `i` and `j` will be 0, and the function will return 0.
   - If the first and last elements are different, the function correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal using a single operation.

4. **Output**:
   - The function outputs the correct minimum cost for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required operation and handles all edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
