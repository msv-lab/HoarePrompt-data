### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It uses two while loops to find the first position `i` where the elements start differing and the last position `j` where the elements start differing from the end.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it calculates the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0, which gives the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it calculates the minimum of `n - i - 1` and `j`, which gives the minimum length of the subarray that needs to be changed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire array might already be uniform (all elements are the same).
   - It also handles cases where the array might be uniform except for the beginning or the end.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost required to make all elements equal, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios including uniform arrays, non-uniform arrays, and arrays with differing segments at the beginning and end.
   - The output matches the expected results for these test cases.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the function logic, there is a critical flaw in the function `func_1`.

#### Flaw in the Function Logic:
- The function `func_1` only checks for uniformity at the beginning and end of the array. It assumes that the first and last elements being different implies that the entire array must be changed from the first differing element to the last differing element from the end. This is not always true.

Consider the following example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`
- According to the function, it would find `i = 0` and `j = 5`, and return `max(5 - 0 - 1, 0) = 4`.
- However, the optimal solution would be to change the entire array to any single value, which costs `6` burles (since the entire array has 6 elements).

The function fails to consider the possibility of changing the entire array to a uniform value, which could be cheaper than the calculated cost.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not account for the possibility of making the entire array uniform, which could be the optimal solution in some cases.
