Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, where n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].**
