You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index where arr[i] != arr[i + 1] or len(arr) - 1 if such index does not exist.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: j is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means that `j` will keep moving towards the start of the array until it either reaches the beginning (index 0) or finds an element that is different from its predecessor. At the end of the loop, `j` will point to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or it will be at index 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `j` is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same. Additionally, the first element `arr[0]` is not equal to the last element `arr[-1]`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0. Here, n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is also 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all possible cases correctly.

Consider the following example:
- Input:
```
3
4
1 2 3 1
4
1 1 1 1
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

Expected Output:
```
2
0
4
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
0
0
```

The issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function. It only considers the first and last elements of the array and does not account for the possibility of having multiple segments of different values that need to be unified. The function should find the minimum cost to unify the entire array into a single value, which requires considering all unique values in the array and determining the optimal segment to change.

A correct approach would involve identifying the minimum and maximum values in the array and calculating the cost of unifying the array to either the minimum or maximum value, whichever results in the lower cost.
