### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It uses two while loops to find the first position `i` where the elements start differing and the last position `j` where the elements start differing from the end.
   - The logic for finding `i` and `j` seems correct. However, there is a flaw in the logic when the array has a segment of uniform values in the middle.
   - The function checks if the first and last elements are the same and returns `max(j - i - 1, 0)`. This part is correct if the array is uniform from `i` to `j`.
   - The function then returns `max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)`. This part is incorrect because it does not account for the possibility that the array might have a segment of uniform values in the middle, which could potentially reduce the cost further.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire array might already be uniform (all elements are the same).
   - However, it fails to handle cases where the array has a segment of uniform values in the middle, which should be considered separately.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost required to make all elements equal, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the array has a segment of uniform values in the middle.

### Example to Illustrate the Flaw:
Consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]`.

- The function will set `i` to 1 (since `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` are different) and `j` to 7 (since `arr[7]` and `arr[8]` are different).
- The function will return `max(7 - 1 - 1, 0) = 5`, which is incorrect because the optimal solution would be to change the segment `[2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]` to `4`, costing only 6.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function does not correctly handle the scenario where the array has a segment of uniform values in the middle. The provided solution does not account for this case, leading to incorrect results in some scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
