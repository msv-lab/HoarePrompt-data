Output State: **i is the index where arr[i] != arr[i + 1] or len(arr) - 1 if such index does not exist.**

Explanation: The loop increments `i` as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1` and the element at index `i` is equal to the element at index `i + 1`. This means that the loop will continue to increment `i` as long as consecutive elements in the array are the same. Once it finds a pair of consecutive elements that are not equal, or when `i` reaches the second last element of the array, the loop will terminate. Therefore, `i` will be at the first position where the consecutive elements differ, or at the second last position if all consecutive elements were the same.
