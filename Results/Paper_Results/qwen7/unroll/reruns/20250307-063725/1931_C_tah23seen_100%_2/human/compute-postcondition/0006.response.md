Output State: j is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor or 0 if all elements from the end are the same.

Explanation: The loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means that `j` will keep decreasing until it points to an element that is different from its predecessor or until `j` reaches 0 (meaning all elements from that point to the end of the array are the same).
