### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Function Call**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls `func_1(arr)` to compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by initializing `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the array.
   - It uses two while loops to find the first position `i` where the elements start differing and the last position `j` where the elements start differing from the end.
   - If the first and last elements are the same, it calculates the maximum of `j - i - 1` and 0, which gives the length of the subarray that needs to be changed.
   - If the first and last elements are different, it calculates the minimum of `n - i - 1` and `j`, which gives the minimum length of the subarray that needs to be changed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the entire array might already be uniform (all elements are the same).
   - It also handles cases where the array might be uniform except for the beginning or the end.

4. **Output**:
   - The function returns the minimum cost required to make all elements equal, which is consistent with the problem statement.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios including uniform arrays, non-uniform arrays, and arrays with differing segments at the beginning and end.
   - The output matches the expected results for these test cases.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem requirements accurately.
