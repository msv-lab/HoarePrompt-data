Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the boundaries within which the entire array can be made uniform using a single operation. However, there are several issues with the logic used in the `func_1` function:

1. **Incorrect Boundary Identification**: The function `func_1` incorrectly identifies the boundaries `i` and `j`. It should find the first and last positions where the values differ from their neighbors, rather than just checking for consecutive duplicates.

2. **Logic for Calculating Minimum Operations**: The logic to calculate the minimum operations needed is flawed. The current implementation only considers the first and last differing elements and does not account for the optimal way to make all elements equal.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the entire array is already uniform or when the array has multiple segments that need to be changed.

Given these issues, the provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
