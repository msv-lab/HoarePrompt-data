Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns an integer. It first finds the index `i` from the start of the array where the current element differs from the next one, or 0 if all elements are the same. Then, it finds the index `j` from the end of the array where the current element differs from the previous one, or 0 if all elements are the same. If the first and last elements are the same, it returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of `(n - i - 1)` and `j`, ensuring the result is at least 0. Here, `n` is the length of the array.**
