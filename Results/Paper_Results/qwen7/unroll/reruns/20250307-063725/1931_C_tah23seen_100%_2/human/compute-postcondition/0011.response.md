Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0. Here, n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is also 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].**

Given the initial state, `j` is 0. The expression simplifies to finding the maximum between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and 0, which is simply 0 because the minimum of any non-negative number and 0 is 0.

Therefore, the output state is: **The program returns 0.**
