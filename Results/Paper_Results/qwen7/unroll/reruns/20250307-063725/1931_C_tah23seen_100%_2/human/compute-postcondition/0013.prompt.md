You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    n = len(arr)
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i < len(arr) - 1 and arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: i is the index where arr[i] != arr[i + 1] or len(arr) - 1 if such index does not exist.
    while j > 0 and arr[j] == arr[j - 1]:
        j -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: j is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop decrements `j` as long as `j` is greater than 0 and the current element `arr[j]` is equal to the previous element `arr[j-1]`. This means that `j` will keep moving towards the start of the array until it either reaches the beginning (index 0) or finds an element that is different from its predecessor. At the end of the loop, `j` will point to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or it will be at index 0 if all elements in the array are the same.
    if (arr[0] == arr[-1]) :
        return max(j - i - 1, 0)
        #The program returns 0
    #State: `j` is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same. Additionally, the first element `arr[0]` is not equal to the last element `arr[-1]`.
    return max(min(n - i - 1, j), 0)
    #The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0. Here, n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is also 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. The length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n. The function returns 0 in Case_1. In Case_2, it returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, where n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between the minimum of (n - i - 1) and j, ensuring the result is at least 0. Here, n is the length of the array, i is the index pointing to the first element from the end of the array that is different from its predecessor, or 0 if all elements in the array are the same, and j is also 0 since the first element arr[0] is not equal to the last element arr[-1].


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
