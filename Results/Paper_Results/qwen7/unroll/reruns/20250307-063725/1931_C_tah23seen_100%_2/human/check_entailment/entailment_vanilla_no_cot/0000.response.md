Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` tries to find the first and last different elements in the array and calculates the cost based on their positions. However, it does not handle the general case where the array might contain multiple segments of different values.
   - The logic in `func_1` only checks for the first and last different elements and does not account for the possibility of multiple segments within the array.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the expected output should be 4 (by changing the entire segment from index 1 to 3 to the value at index 0 or 5). However, the current implementation would incorrectly return 2.
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`, the expected output should be 2 (by changing the entire segment from index 1 to 3 or 3 to 5 to the value at index 0 or 5). The current implementation might not handle this correctly.

To fix this, the solution needs to identify all segments of different values and calculate the minimum cost to make all elements equal. This involves iterating through the array to find transitions between different values and calculating the cost for each possible segment.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    min_cost = float('inf')
    
    # Find all transition points
    transitions = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != arr[i-1]:
            transitions.append(i)
    
    # If there are no transitions, all elements are already the same
    if not transitions:
        return 0
    
    # Calculate cost for each segment
    for i in range(len(transitions)):
        start = transitions[i]
        end = transitions[(i+1) % len(transitions)] - 1
        cost = end - start + 1
        min_cost = min(min_cost, cost)
    
    return min_cost

# Main part of the program remains the same
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1
```

This corrected version identifies all segments of different values and calculates the minimum cost to make all elements equal.
