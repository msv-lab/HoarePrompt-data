Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces. The first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`.**
