Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, the first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is `M1 - 2`.**

The code `cur = M1 - 2` updates the value of `cur` to be `M1 - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
