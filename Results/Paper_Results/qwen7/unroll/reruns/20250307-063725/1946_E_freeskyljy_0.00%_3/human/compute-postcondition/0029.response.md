Output State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is 2, and `ans` is updated according to the operations inside the loop.**

Explanation: The code `cur = 1` updates the value of `cur` to 1. The values of `nums_left`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial states. Since `i` was initially 1, after updating `cur`, `i` is incremented to 2. The condition `M2 > 1` remains true if it was true before, and the value of `M2` remains unchanged.
