Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are integers obtained from input split by spaces, L is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `L = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in a list called `L`. The variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2` remain unchanged from their initial state, and the variable `t` also remains unchanged.
