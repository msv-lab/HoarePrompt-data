Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns 0 in three cases. In the fourth case, it returns ans, which is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and the values of cur and nums_left remain unchanged.**

This means the function does not take any input parameters but instead handles different scenarios internally. In three of those scenarios, it returns 0. In the fourth scenario, it calculates a specific product modulo a given MOD value and ensures that the variables `cur` and `nums_left` do not change during this calculation.
