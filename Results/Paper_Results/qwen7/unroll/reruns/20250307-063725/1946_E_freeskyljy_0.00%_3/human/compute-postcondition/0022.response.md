Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the conditions under which it can execute the first time.

The `while` loop is defined as follows:
```python
while i > 1:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop condition is `i > 1`. This means that for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than 1.

Given the state right before the loop:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces
- `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces
- `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces
- The first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`
- `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`
- `cur` is `M1 - 2`
- `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`
- `i` is `L[-1] - 1`

We need to ensure that `i` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time. 

From the given information:
- `i` is defined as `L[-1] - 1`.

To satisfy the condition `i > 1`, we need to ensure that `L[-1] - 1 > 1`, which simplifies to `L[-1] > 2`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `L[-1]` to be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, the first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1` and `L[-1]` must be greater than 2.**
