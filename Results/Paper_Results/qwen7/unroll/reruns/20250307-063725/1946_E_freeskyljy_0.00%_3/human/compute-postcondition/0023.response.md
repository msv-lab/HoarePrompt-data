Output State: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `0`, `i` is `1`.

Explanation: The loop runs while `i` is greater than 1. Initially, `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`. The loop decrements `i` by 1 in each iteration and checks if `i` equals the current value of `L[cur]`. If it does, `cur` is decremented. Otherwise, `ans` is updated with a multiplication operation involving `ans`, `nums_left`, and modulo `MOD`. After each iteration, `nums_left` is decremented by 1. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented until it reaches 0, the loop will run exactly `L[-1] - 2` times. Once `i` reaches 1, the loop terminates. At the end of the loop, `i` is 1, `cur` remains `M1 - 2` (unchanged throughout the loop), and `nums_left` is 0.
