Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from the input and splits them using the `map` function with `int` to convert the input strings to integers. These integers are then assigned to `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the specified range, while `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are the integers read from the input.
