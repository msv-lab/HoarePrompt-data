Output State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `ans` is updated according to the operations inside the loop.**

Explanation: The value of `i` is assigned the value of `R[0] + 1`. The other variables (`cur`, `nums_left`, and `ans`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
