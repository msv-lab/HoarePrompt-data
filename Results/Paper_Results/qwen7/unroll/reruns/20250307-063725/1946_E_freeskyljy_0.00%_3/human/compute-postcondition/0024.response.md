Output State: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `0`, `i` is `1`.

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i > 1`. Initially, `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`, which is `nums_left + 2`. Inside the loop, if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented. Otherwise, `ans` is updated with a multiplication operation and then reduced modulo `MOD`. After each iteration, `nums_left` is decremented by 1 and `i` is also decremented by 1. This process continues until `i` becomes 1, at which point the loop terminates. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented until it reaches 0, and `i` is decremented from `L[-1] - 1` to 1, the loop will execute exactly `nums_left + 1` times, leaving `nums_left` at 0 and `i` at 1.
