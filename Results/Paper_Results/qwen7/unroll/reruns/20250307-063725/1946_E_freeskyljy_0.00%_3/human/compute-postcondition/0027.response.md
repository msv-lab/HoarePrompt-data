Output State: **`cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is `1`, and `ans` is updated according to the operations inside the loop if `M1 > 1`. If `M1 <= 1`, the values remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The code updates the value of `nums_left` to `N - R[0] - 1`. The other variables (`cur`, `i`, and `ans`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
