### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It validates that the last index of prefix maximums (`L[-1]`) matches the first index of suffix maximums (`R[0]`), which is necessary for a valid permutation.
   - It also checks if the first index of prefix maximums (`L[0]`) is 1 and the first index of suffix maximums (`R[0]`) is `N`, ensuring the permutation starts and ends with the largest numbers.

2. **Special Cases Handling**:
   - If there are multiple prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and their positions overlap in a way that invalidates the permutation (specifically, if `L[-2]` equals `R[1]`), the program correctly returns 0.
     - However, the check `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:` is not sufficient. The condition should be more general to handle all overlapping cases properly. For example, if any prefix maximum is directly followed by a suffix maximum without any other elements in between, it should invalidate the permutation.

3. **Combination Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the number of possible permutations using combinations (`math.comb`). This part is crucial because it determines how many ways we can place the remaining numbers after fixing the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The logic for adjusting the combination count based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums is implemented correctly.
     - Specifically, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements by considering the gaps between the fixed positions.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is necessary due to the potentially large number of permutations.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where there might be only one prefix or suffix maximum, ensuring the logic remains sound.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is read, and `func_1()` is called for each test case.
  
- **State After Reading Test Case Details**:
  - `N`, `M1`, `M2` are read.
  - `L` and `R` are read.
  - The program checks if `L[-1]` matches `R[0]`. If not, it returns 0.
  - The program checks if `L[0]` is 1 and `R[0]` is `N`. If not, it returns 0.
  - The program checks if `L[-2]` equals `R[1]`. If true, it returns 0.
  - If none of the above conditions are met, the program proceeds to calculate the number of permutations using combinations.

- **Combination Calculation**:
  - The program calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements by considering the gaps between the fixed positions.
  - The logic for adjusting the combination count based on the positions of prefix and suffix maximums is correct.

- **Modulo Operation**:
  - The result is taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) correctly.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles the validation and combination calculation. However, the special case handling for overlapping prefix and suffix maximums needs to be more robust. The current check `if M1 > 1 and M2 > 1 and L[-2] == R[1]:` is insufficient to cover all overlapping cases. Therefore, the original assessment is slightly inaccurate due to this oversight.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
