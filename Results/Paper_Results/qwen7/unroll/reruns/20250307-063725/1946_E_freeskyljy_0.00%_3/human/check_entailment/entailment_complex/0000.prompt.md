Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

        #State: Output State: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `0`, `i` is `1`.
        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i > 1`. Initially, `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`, which is `nums_left + 2`. Inside the loop, if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented. Otherwise, `ans` is updated with a multiplication operation and then reduced modulo `MOD`. After each iteration, `nums_left` is decremented by 1 and `i` is also decremented by 1. This process continues until `i` becomes 1, at which point the loop terminates. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented until it reaches 0, and `i` is decremented from `L[-1] - 1` to 1, the loop will execute exactly `nums_left + 1` times, leaving `nums_left` at 0 and `i` at 1.
    #State: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `0`, `i` is `1`, and `ans` is updated according to the operations inside the loop if `M1 > 1`. If `M1 <= 1`, the values remain unchanged.
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if (M2 > 1) :
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: cur is R.length, ans is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and nums_left is 0.
    #State: `cur` is `R.length`, `ans` is the product of `(N - R[0] - 1)` to `(N - R[R.length-1] - 1)` modulo `MOD`, and `nums_left` is `0` if `M2 > 1`. If `M2 <= 1`, the values of `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and the values of cur and nums_left remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists of integers, `L` and `R`, along with integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. It checks several conditions involving the elements of these lists and the integers. If any of the specified conditions are met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a specific mathematical value based on the elements of `L` and `R` and returns this value modulo `MOD`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns either 0 or a calculated value.
