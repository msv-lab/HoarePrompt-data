Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces.**

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and stores these integers in a list named `R`. The values of `t`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, and `L` remain unchanged from their initial state.
