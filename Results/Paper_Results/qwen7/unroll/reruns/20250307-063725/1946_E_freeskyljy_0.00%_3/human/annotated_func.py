        #
        #Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i > 1`. Initially, `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`, which is `nums_left + 2`. Inside the loop, if `i` equals `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decremented. Otherwise, `ans` is updated with a multiplication operation and then reduced modulo `MOD`. After each iteration, `nums_left` is decremented by 1 and `i` is also decremented by 1. This process continues until `i` becomes 1, at which point the loop terminates. Since `nums_left` starts at `L[-1] - 2` and is decremented until it reaches 0, and `i` is decremented from `L[-1] - 1` to 1, the loop will execute exactly `nums_left + 1` times, leaving `nums_left` at 0 and `i` at 1.
    #State: `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `0`, `i` is `1`, and `ans` is updated according to the operations inside the loop if `M1 > 1`. If `M1 <= 1`, the values remain unchanged.
    nums_left = N - R[0] - 1
    if (M2 > 1) :
        cur = 1
        i = R[0] + 1
        while i < N:
            if i == R[cur]:
                cur += 1
            else:
                ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
            
            nums_left -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: cur is R.length, ans is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and nums_left is 0.
    #State: `cur` is `R.length`, `ans` is the product of `(N - R[0] - 1)` to `(N - R[R.length-1] - 1)` modulo `MOD`, and `nums_left` is `0` if `M2 > 1`. If `M2 <= 1`, the values of `cur`, `ans`, and `nums_left` remain unchanged.
    return ans
    #The program returns ans which is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and the values of cur and nums_left remain unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two lists of integers, `L` and `R`, along with integers `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. It checks several conditions involving the elements of these lists and the integers. If any of the specified conditions are met, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a specific mathematical value based on the elements of `L` and `R` and returns this value modulo `MOD`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns either 0 or a calculated value.
