Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has some logical issues and does not correctly handle all edge cases. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problems:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Edge Cases:**
   - The function `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the last prefix maximum is not equal to the first suffix maximum. This should indeed result in returning 0, but the code does not account for this scenario fully.
   - The logic for calculating the number of permutations is flawed. Specifically, the way it calculates the combination and updates the answer is not correct.

2. **Incorrect Combination Calculation:**
   - The combination calculation `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` is used to calculate the number of ways to place the largest element in the permutation. However, the subsequent logic for updating the answer is incorrect and does not reflect the actual constraints of the problem.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic:**
   - The loops that iterate through the prefix and suffix maximums do not correctly update the answer based on the constraints of the problem. For example, the decrementing logic for `nums_left` and the way the answer is updated is not aligned with the problem requirements.

4. **Missing Constraints Handling:**
   - The code does not handle all possible constraints and edge cases, such as when there are multiple prefix or suffix maximums and how they interact with each other.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to carefully handle the placement of the maximum elements and ensure that the constraints of the prefix and suffix maximums are respected. A more robust approach would involve dynamic programming or a combinatorial method that correctly accounts for all the given constraints.
