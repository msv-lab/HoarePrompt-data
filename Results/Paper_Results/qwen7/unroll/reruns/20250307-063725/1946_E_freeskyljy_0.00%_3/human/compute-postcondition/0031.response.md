Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < N`.
2. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The variables involved in the loop head are `i` and `N`.
3. **Determine the current state of the variables**:
   - `cur` is 1 (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1` (not relevant to the loop condition).
   - `i` is `R[0] + 1` (relevant to the loop condition).
   - `ans` is updated inside the loop (not relevant to the loop condition).

4. **Check the loop condition with the current state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be less than `N`.
   - Given that `i` is currently `R[0] + 1`, for the loop to execute, `R[0] + 1` must be less than `N`.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is `R[0] + 1`, we need to ensure that `R[0] + 1` is less than `N`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect this requirement.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is `R[0] + 1`, and `i` must be less than `N`**
