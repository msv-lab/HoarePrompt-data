Output State: **cur is R.length, ans is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and nums_left is 0.**

Explanation: The loop iterates from `i = R[0] + 1` to `i = N`. During each iteration, if `i` equals the current value of `R[cur]`, `cur` is incremented. Otherwise, `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` and taking modulo `MOD`. `nums_left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration. After all iterations, `cur` will be equal to the length of array `R`, `ans` will be the product of the sequence `(N - R[0] - 1) * (N - R[1] - 2) * ... * (N - R[R.length-1] - R.length)` modulo `MOD`, and `nums_left` will be 0 since it is decremented until it reaches 0.
