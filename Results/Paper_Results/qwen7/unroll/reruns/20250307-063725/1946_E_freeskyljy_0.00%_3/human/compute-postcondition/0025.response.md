Postcondition: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, the first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `0`, and `i` is `1`. If `M1 > 1`, the loop executes and updates `cur`, `ans`, `nums_left`, and `i` accordingly until `i` becomes 1, at which point `nums_left` is set to 0 and `i` is set to 1. If `M1 <= 1`, no changes occur to the variables.
