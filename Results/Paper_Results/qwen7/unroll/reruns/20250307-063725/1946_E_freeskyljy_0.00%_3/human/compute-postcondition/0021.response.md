The code `i = L[-1] - 1` assigns the value of `L[-1] - 1` to the variable `i`. Given that `L` is a list of integers and its last element `L[-1]` is an integer, the value of `i` is `L[-1] - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `N`, `M1`, `M2` are integers obtained from input split by spaces, `L` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `R` is a list of integers obtained from input split by spaces, the first element of `L` is equal to 1 and the first element of `R` is equal to `N`, `ans` is the result of math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`.**
