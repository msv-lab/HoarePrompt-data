Output State: **The program returns ans which is the product of (N - R[0] - 1) to (N - R[R.length-1] - 1) modulo MOD, and the values of cur and nums_left remain unchanged.**

This means that the program returns the value of `ans`, which is calculated as the product of `(N - R[i] - 1)` for each element `R[i]` in the list `R`, taken modulo `MOD`. The values of `cur` and `nums_left` do not change and are not part of the returned value.
