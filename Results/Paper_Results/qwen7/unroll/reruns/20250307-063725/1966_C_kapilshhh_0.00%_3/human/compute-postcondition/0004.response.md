Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It returns the result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. The function then processes these inputs according to specified rules but does not explicitly define what those rules are in the provided snippet.
