Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the Winner:**
   - The logic used to determine the winner is flawed. The current implementation checks if `dp` is true or false after a series of operations but doesn't correctly implement the Nim Game strategy.
   - In the Nim Game, the key concept is the XOR of the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

2. **Unnecessary Operations:**
   - The code sorts and modifies the array in an unnecessary manner. It also adds a zero at the end of the array, which is not required.
   - The use of `dp` variable is not aligned with the Nim Game strategy.

3. **Incorrect Final Output:**
   - The final output should be "Alice" or "Bob" based on the Nim Game strategy, but the current implementation incorrectly prints "Alice" in all cases.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program based on the Nim Game strategy:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum == 0:
            print("Bob")
        else:
            print("Alice")
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This solution correctly implements the Nim Game strategy by calculating the XOR of all pile sizes and determining the winner based on the result.
