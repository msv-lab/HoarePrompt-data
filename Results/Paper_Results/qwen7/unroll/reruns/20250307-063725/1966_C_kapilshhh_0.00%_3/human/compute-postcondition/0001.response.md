The only variable in the loop head is `tc`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `tc`. For the loop to execute the first time, `tc` must be greater than 0.

Given that `tc` is an input integer and all other variables are not yet defined, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring `tc` is greater than 0.

State: **`tc` is an input integer and must be greater than 0**
