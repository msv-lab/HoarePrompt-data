Output State: The output state will be a series of "Alice" or "Alice" printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration of `tc`.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the program reads an integer `n`, then takes a list of integers as input, sorts it in descending order, removes duplicates, appends a zero, and checks a condition using dynamic programming (`dp`). If the condition is met, it prints "Alice". This process repeats `tc` times, and the output is the result of each iteration concatenated together. Since the exact inputs for each iteration are not specified, the output can only be described as a sequence of "Alice" based on the logic within the loop.
