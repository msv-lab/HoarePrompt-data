The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It then sorts the list in descending order, removes duplicates, and appends a zero. The function checks if the difference between consecutive elements (or the last element and zero) is greater than 1 or if a boolean variable `dp` remains `False`. Based on this check, it prints "Alice" or "Bob". This process is repeated for each test case until all test cases are processed.
