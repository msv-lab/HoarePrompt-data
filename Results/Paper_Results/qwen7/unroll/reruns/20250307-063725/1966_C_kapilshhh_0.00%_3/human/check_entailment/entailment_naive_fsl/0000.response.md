Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on a simplified condition that does not account for the optimal strategy required to solve this problem.

The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles after sorting them. If the result is non-zero, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. This is because the XOR operation helps determine the parity of the Nim-sum, which is crucial in determining the winner in such games.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    tc = int(input())
    while tc > 0:
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        arr = sorted(arr)
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
        tc -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version correctly implements the game logic and will output the correct winner for each test case.
