Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing either "Alice" or "Bob". The number of lines will be equal to the value of `tc` provided initially. Each line corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop based on the input values provided during that iteration.

For each iteration, the program processes the input as follows:
1. It reads an integer `n`.
2. It takes a list of integers as input, sorts it in descending order, removes duplicates, and appends a zero.
3. It initializes a boolean variable `dp` to `True`.
4. It iterates through the list to check if the difference between consecutive elements (or the last element and zero) is greater than 1 or if `dp` remains `False`.
5. Based on the final value of `dp`, it prints "Alice" or "Bob".
6. It decrements `tc` by 1.

The exact output will depend on the specific inputs provided during each iteration, but the process described above will be repeated until `tc` becomes 0.
