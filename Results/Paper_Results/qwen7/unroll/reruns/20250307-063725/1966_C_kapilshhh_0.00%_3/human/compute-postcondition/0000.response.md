Output State: **`tc` is an input integer, and all other variables are not yet defined.**

The code `tc = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `tc`. Since no other variables are defined or modified in this line of code, the initial conditions for `t` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged. The variable `tc` now holds the number of test cases, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
