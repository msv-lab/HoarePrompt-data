Output State: **The list `s` has all '1's moved to the left side and all '0's moved to the right side, with their relative order preserved. The variable `left` points to the position just after the last '1', `right` points to the position just before the first '0', and `cost` is the total number of swaps performed during the process.**

To break it down further:
- The loop continues as long as there are elements to swap (i.e., `left <= right`), and there are more elements to check on the right (`right < len(s)`), and more elements to check on the left (`left < len(s)`).
- When a '1' is found at `left` and a '0' is found at `right`, they are swapped, and the `cost` is incremented by the distance between them plus one.
- The `right` pointer then moves to find the next '0'.
- Similarly, the `left` pointer moves to find the next '1'.
- This process continues until all '1's are to the left and all '0's are to the right, with the exact positions of these elements being preserved.
