Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order. Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1` function does not handle all possible cases effectively. For instance, consider the input string `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to achieve the sorted string, but the current implementation does not account for these multiple shifts correctly.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program initializes the `left` and `right` pointers and iterates through the string to find positions where a swap is needed.
2. **Swapping Logic**: When a `1` is found to the left of a `0`, the program swaps them and increments the cost by the length of the substring between `left` and `right`.
3. **Pointer Movement**: The `left` and `right` pointers are moved to the next positions where they need to be checked again.

However, this approach fails to handle cases where multiple cyclic shifts are required to sort the string. For example, in the string `101011`, the program might incorrectly handle the shifts and not achieve the optimal cost.

A more effective approach would involve identifying the longest prefix that is already sorted and then performing cyclic shifts on the remaining unsorted part of the string. This would ensure that the minimum total cost is calculated correctly.

Since the provided program does not handle all cases correctly, the correctness is **False**.
