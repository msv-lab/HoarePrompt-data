### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to sort a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and minimizing the total cost of these operations. The cost of each operation is the length of the substring being shifted.

2. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to transform the binary string into a sorted order by performing cyclic shifts. However, the current implementation does not actually perform cyclic shifts. Instead, it tries to swap elements based on certain conditions, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.
   - The function iterates through the string and attempts to swap elements when a '0' is found before a '1'. This is not a correct approach because it does not simulate the effect of a cyclic shift.
   - The logic for finding the positions `left` and `right` is flawed. It does not correctly identify the positions that need to be swapped to achieve a sorted string through cyclic shifts.
   - The function does not handle the actual cyclic shift operation, which is necessary to solve the problem as described.

3. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code provides a clear understanding of the intended behavior of the function. However, the actual implementation does not match the intended behavior. The function does not perform cyclic shifts and instead attempts to swap elements based on certain conditions, which is not the correct approach.
   - The annotated code states that the function should move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right while preserving their relative order within each group. This is not achieved by the current implementation.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the issues identified in the original assessment, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function does not perform the required cyclic shifts and instead attempts to swap elements, which is not equivalent to the desired operation.
   - Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**False**
