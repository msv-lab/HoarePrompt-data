### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to sort a binary string by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and minimizing the total cost of these operations.
   - A cyclic shift of a substring \( s[l, r] \) means moving the character at position \( r \) to the beginning of the substring and shifting all other characters to the right.

2. **Function `func_1(s)` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(s)` aims to move all '1's to the left and all '0's to the right, but it does not perform any cyclic shifts. Instead, it attempts to swap elements based on certain conditions.
   - The logic for finding the positions `left` and `right` is flawed because it does not correctly identify the positions that need to be swapped to achieve a sorted string through cyclic shifts.

3. **Cyclic Shift Implementation**:
   - The function should identify the longest contiguous segment of '1's and perform a cyclic shift to move the segment to the leftmost possible position.
   - Similarly, it should identify the longest contiguous segment of '0's and perform a cyclic shift to move the segment to the rightmost possible position.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Identify the longest segment of '1's starting from the left.
   - Perform a cyclic shift to move this segment to the leftmost possible position.
   - Identify the longest segment of '0's starting from the right.
   - Perform a cyclic shift to move this segment to the rightmost possible position.
   - Repeat until the string is sorted.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost of each cyclic shift is the length of the shifted segment.
   - The total cost is the sum of the costs of all cyclic shifts performed.

6. **Function `func_1(s)` Issues**:
   - The function does not correctly identify the segments of '1's and '0's.
   - The function does not perform any cyclic shifts.
   - The function attempts to swap elements based on certain conditions, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not perform the required cyclic shifts and instead attempts to swap elements, which is not the correct approach.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. It does not perform the required cyclic shifts and instead attempts to swap elements, which is not the correct approach. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
