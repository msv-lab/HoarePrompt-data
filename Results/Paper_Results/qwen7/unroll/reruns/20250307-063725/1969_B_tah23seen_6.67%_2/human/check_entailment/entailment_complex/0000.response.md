Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list of characters.
   - Initializes two pointers, `left` and `right`, to traverse the list.
   - Uses a while loop to find positions where a swap is needed to move '1's to the left and '0's to the right.
   - When a '0' is found at a position greater than '1', a swap is performed, and the cost is incremented by the length of the substring involved in the swap.
   - Adjusts the `left` and `right` pointers to continue the process until all necessary swaps are made.
   - Returns the total cost of the swaps.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The logic ensures that all '1's are moved to the left and all '0's to the right while preserving their relative order within each group.
   - The cost calculation is accurate as it counts the number of swaps needed to achieve the desired order.
   - The implementation handles all edge cases, including strings that are already sorted and strings with multiple segments of '1's and '0's.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
