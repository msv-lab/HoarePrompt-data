Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(s)` with the binary string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate swapping elements.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers to traverse the list.
   - The main logic involves moving '1's to the left and '0's to the right by performing cyclic shifts on substrings.
   - The while loop conditions ensure that the pointers do not go out of bounds and handle the traversal efficiently.
   - When a '0' is found at the `right` pointer and a '1' is found at the `left` pointer, a cyclic shift is performed to swap them, updating the `cost` accordingly.
   - The inner while loops increment the `right` and `left` pointers to find the next '0' and '1' respectively, ensuring that the relative order of '1's and '0's is maintained.

3. **Output**: The function returns the total cost, which is the sum of the lengths of the substrings that were cyclically shifted to achieve the sorted order.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement. It ensures that all '1's are moved to the left and all '0's to the right with minimal cost.

Correctness: **True**
