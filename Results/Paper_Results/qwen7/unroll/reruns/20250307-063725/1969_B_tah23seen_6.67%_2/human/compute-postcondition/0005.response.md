Output State: **`s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, in the same order they appeared; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `cost` is assigned the value 0. This initializes `cost` but does not affect the lists or the value of `left`. Therefore, `s` remains unchanged, `left` remains 0, and `cost` is now 0.
