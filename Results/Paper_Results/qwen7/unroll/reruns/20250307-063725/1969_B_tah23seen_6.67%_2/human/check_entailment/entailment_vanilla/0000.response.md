Reasoning:

1. The provided code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling the function `func_1(s)` and printing the result.
2. The function `func_1(s)` is designed to transform the binary string into a sorted order by performing cyclic shifts on substrings and calculating the cost of these operations.
3. However, there are several issues with the implementation of `func_1(s)`:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s`, but it does not actually perform any cyclic shifts. Instead, it attempts to swap elements based on certain conditions, which is not equivalent to a cyclic shift.
   - The logic for finding the positions `left` and `right` is flawed. It does not correctly identify the positions that need to be swapped to achieve a sorted string through cyclic shifts.
   - The function does not handle the actual cyclic shift operation, which is necessary to solve the problem as described.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
