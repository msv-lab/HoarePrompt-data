Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop condition is `left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s))`.
   - The relevant variables here are `left`, `right`, and `len(s)`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values:**
   - `left` is 0.
   - `right` is 1.
   - `len(s)` is the length of the list `s`, which contains all characters from `sChar` in the same order they appeared.

3. **Check Each Condition in the Loop:**
   - `left <= right`: This is true because `left` (0) is less than or equal to `right` (1).
   - `right < len(s)`: For this to be true, `right` (1) must be less than the length of `s`.
   - `left < len(s)`: For this to be true, `left` (0) must be less than the length of `s`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `left` is 0 and `right` is 1, both conditions `left <= right` and `left < len(s)` are already satisfied.
   - The only condition that might need adjustment is `right < len(s)`. For the loop to execute the first time, `right` (1) must be less than the length of `s`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The only state that needs to be adjusted is `right` being less than the length of `s`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, in the same order they appeared; `left` is 0; `cost` is 0; `right` is 1 and `right` must be less than the length of `s`**
