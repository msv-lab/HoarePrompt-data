Output State: **`s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, in the same order they appeared; `left` is 0**

Explanation: The variable `left` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it within the given code snippet. Therefore, `s` still contains all characters from `sChar` in the same order they appeared, and `left` is set to 0.
