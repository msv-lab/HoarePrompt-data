Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is being assigned each character from the string `sChar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since `i` is being assigned each character from `sChar`, the initial value of `i` should be the first character of `sChar`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `sChar`**: The string `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000. For the loop to execute, `sChar` must contain at least one character.

4. **State adjustment**: We need to ensure that `sChar` is a non-empty binary string and that `i` is set to the first character of `sChar`.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `sChar` must be a non-empty binary string.
- `i` must be the first character of `sChar`.

Therefore, the modified state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `sChar`**.
