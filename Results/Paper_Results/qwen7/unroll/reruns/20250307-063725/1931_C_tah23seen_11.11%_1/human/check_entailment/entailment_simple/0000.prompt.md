Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    print(func_1(arr))
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i is greater than j.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: i is greater than j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. Each iteration of the loop increments `i` by 1. This process continues until `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, at which point the loop terminates. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `i` will be pointing to an index where the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is false.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between index `j` and index `i` plus one, which represents the length of the subarray starting from index `i` to index `j` where each element is not equal to its next element.
    #State: `i` points to an index where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the length of array `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
