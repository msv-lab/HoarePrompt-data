Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not address the problem requirements properly.

Here's a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
The program will output `4`, but the correct answer should be `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible operations and their costs to find the minimum cost. The current implementation only checks if the first and last elements are the same and then tries to extend the operation to cover more elements, which is not sufficient to find the optimal solution.

A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more comprehensive search strategy to explore all possible operations and their costs.
