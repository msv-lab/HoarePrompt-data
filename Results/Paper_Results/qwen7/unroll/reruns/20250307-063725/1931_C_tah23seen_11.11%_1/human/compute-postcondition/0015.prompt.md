You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and each element a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= n.
def func_1(arr):
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    while i <= j:
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: i is greater than j.
    if (i > j) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State: i is greater than j
    while arr[i] == arr[i + 1]:
        i += 1
        
    #State: Output State: i points to an index where arr[i] is no longer equal to arr[i + 1].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop continues as long as the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the next element `arr[i + 1]`. Each iteration of the loop increments `i` by 1. This process continues until `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, at which point the loop terminates. Therefore, after the loop finishes executing, `i` will be pointing to an index where the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` is false.
    if (j != len(arr) - 1) :
        return j - i + 1
        #The program returns the difference between index `j` and index `i` plus one, which represents the length of the subarray starting from index `i` to index `j` where each element is not equal to its next element.
    #State: `i` points to an index where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`, and `j` is equal to the length of `arr` minus one
    return j - i
    #The program returns the difference between the length of array `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns either 0, the length of a subarray where each element is not equal to its next element, or the difference between the length of `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 0

Case_2: The program returns the difference between index `j` and index `i` plus one, which represents the length of the subarray starting from index `i` to index `j` where each element is not equal to its next element.

Case_3: The program returns the difference between the length of array `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
