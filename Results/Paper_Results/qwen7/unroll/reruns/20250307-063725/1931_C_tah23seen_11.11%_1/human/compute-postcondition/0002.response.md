Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `i <= j`.
2. The variables involved in the loop condition are `i` and `j`.
3. Right before the loop, `i` is 0 and `j` is the length of `arr` - 1.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `i <= j` must be true.

- `i` is already 0, which satisfies the condition as long as `j` is non-negative.
- `j` is the length of `arr` - 1, which means `j` is a non-negative integer (since the length of an array is always a non-negative integer).

Given these conditions, `j` being the length of `arr` - 1 already ensures that `j` is non-negative and thus the loop can execute the first time.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the given states.

State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**
