### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Array Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and initializes the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed:
     - It checks if the first and last elements of the array are equal (`arr[i] == arr[j]`). If they are, it increments `i` and decrements `j`.
     - If the first and last elements are not equal, it breaks out of the loop.
     - After the loop, it checks if `i` is greater than `j`. If so, it returns `0` (indicating no operation needed).
     - It then checks if the element at index `i` is equal to the next element (`arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`). If they are, it increments `i`.
     - Finally, it returns `j - i + 1` if `j` is not the last index; otherwise, it returns `j - i`.

3. **Flaws in the Logic**:
   - The function does not consider the optimal way to make all elements equal. It only checks the first and last elements and does not account for other possible operations.
   - The function does not handle cases where the array needs to be made uniform by selecting different segments and assigning them a common value.
   - The function does not correctly calculate the minimum cost required to make all elements equal.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The logic in the `func_1` function is insufficient and does not provide the correct solution.

### Correctness:
**False**
