Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns either 0, the length of a subarray where each element is not equal to its next element, or the difference between the length of `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**

- If all elements in `arr` are the same, the function returns 0.
- Otherwise, the function finds the longest subarray where each element is not equal to its next element and returns its length.
- If such a subarray does not exist, the function returns the difference between the length of `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.
