Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the minimum cost to make all elements of an array equal using at most one operation. The operation involves selecting a subarray and setting all its elements to a chosen value, with the cost being the length of the subarray.

2. **Program Structure**:
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and calls the function `func_1`.
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function starts by identifying the longest subarray where all elements are the same (`arr[i] == arr[j]`).
   - If such a subarray exists (i.e., `i > j`), it means the entire array is already uniform, and the cost is 0.
   - Otherwise, it checks for consecutive equal elements starting from `i` and breaks the loop when it finds a different element.
   - Depending on whether `j` is still within bounds, it calculates the cost as either `j - i + 1` or `len(arr) - 1 - i`.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
   - It handles the case where the entire array is uniform.
   - It correctly calculates the minimum cost by considering the remaining part of the array after the longest uniform subarray.

Given the analysis, the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
