### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to make all elements of the array equal by performing at most one operation. Each operation involves selecting a subarray from index `i` to `j` and setting all elements in that subarray to a value `x`. The cost of such an operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
The function `func_1` has the following logic:
1. It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. It iterates through the array to find the first pair of elements that are different.
3. If the entire array is already uniform (i.e., all elements are the same), it returns `0`.
4. Otherwise, it checks if the elements from `i` to `i+1` are the same. If they are, it increments `i`.
5. Finally, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

#### Issues with `func_1`:
1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The function does not actually compute the cost of any operation. Instead, it returns a length of a subarray, which does not necessarily represent the minimum cost.
2. **Limited Scope**: The function only considers the first pair of different elements and does not explore other possible operations that could achieve the goal with a lower cost.
3. **No Dynamic Programming or Comprehensive Search**: The function does not use any dynamic programming or a more comprehensive search strategy to explore all possible operations and their costs.

#### Example Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
- The function `func_1` will identify the first pair of different elements as `1` and `2` at indices `0` and `1`.
- It will then return `5 - 0 + 1 = 6`, which is incorrect because the optimal solution is to set the entire array to `1` or `2` with a cost of `2`.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more comprehensive search strategy to explore all possible operations and their costs. This would ensure that the minimum cost is found.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not address the problem requirements properly.

**Final: False**
