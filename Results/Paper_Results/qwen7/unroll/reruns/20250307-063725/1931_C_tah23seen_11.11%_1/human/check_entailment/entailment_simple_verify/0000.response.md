### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation.
- The operation allows us to set a subarray from index `i` to `j` to a value `x`.
- The cost of the operation is `(j - i + 1)`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop:**
   - The main loop reads the input values and calls the `func_1` function.
   - `func_1` is supposed to return the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function starts by initializing two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - It then iterates over the array to find the first position where the elements differ.
   - If the entire array is uniform (all elements are the same), it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it returns the length of the subarray from `i` to `j` minus 1.

#### Key Issues:
- The function `func_1` does not handle all possible scenarios to find the minimum cost.
- It only checks if the first and last elements are the same and then tries to extend the operation to cover more elements, which is insufficient.
- The function does not explore all possible subarrays to find the minimum cost.

#### Example Counterexample:
Consider the input:
```
6
1 2 3 4 5 1
```
- The function `func_1` will find that `arr[0]` (1) is different from `arr[5]` (1).
- It will return `5 - 0 + 1 = 6`, which is incorrect.
- The correct answer should be 2, as setting the subarray `[2, 4]` to 3 would make all elements equal.

#### Correct Approach:
A correct approach would involve dynamic programming or a more comprehensive search strategy to explore all possible operations and their costs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. The logic in the `func_1` function is flawed and does not address the problem requirements properly.

**Final: False**
