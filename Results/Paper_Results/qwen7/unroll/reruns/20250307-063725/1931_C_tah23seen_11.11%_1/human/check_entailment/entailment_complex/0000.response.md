Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. The cost of the operation is the length of the subarray selected.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It then calls the function `func_1(arr)` to determine the minimum cost.
   - The function `func_1(arr)`:
     - Identifies the longest contiguous subarray where all elements are the same.
     - Returns the length of the subarray where the elements are different from their next element, or 0 if the entire array is uniform.

3. **Function `func_1(arr)` Analysis**:
   - It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to identify the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
   - If the entire array is uniform (`i > j`), it returns 0.
   - Otherwise, it checks for the first occurrence where `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]` and calculates the cost as `j - i + 1`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already uniform, the function correctly returns 0.
   - If there is a segment where the elements are different, the function correctly identifies the start of this segment and calculates the cost accurately.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies the longest subarray where all elements are the same.
   - It then correctly calculates the cost of making the array uniform by selecting the segment where the elements differ.
   - The overall structure of the program is correct and handles all given constraints and examples.

Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
