Output State: **i is greater than j.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `j`. Inside the loop, if the elements at indices `i` and `j` are equal, both `i` and `j` are adjusted (incrementing `i` and decrementing `j`). If they are not equal, the loop breaks immediately. After the loop completes, it means no further pairs of elements can be found that are equal and symmetric around the center (if such pairs existed), thus ensuring that `i` will always be greater than `j`.
