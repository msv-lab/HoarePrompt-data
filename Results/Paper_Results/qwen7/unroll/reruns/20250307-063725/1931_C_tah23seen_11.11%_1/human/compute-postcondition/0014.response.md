Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of integers. It returns either 0, the length of a subarray where each element is not equal to its next element, or the difference between the length of `arr` minus one and the index `i` where `arr[i]` is no longer equal to `arr[i + 1]`.**
