Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic of the `func_1` function, which does not account for the optimal way to make all elements of the array equal using at most one operation. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Logic**: 
   - The function attempts to find the first pair of unequal elements from both ends of the array (`i` and `j`). However, it does not consider the possibility of making all elements equal by setting them to a common value within the range `[i, j]`.
   - The function returns the length of the subarray `[i, j]` when it finds the first pair of unequal elements. This approach is incorrect because it doesn't minimize the cost of operations.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost of an operation is `(j - i + 1)` burles. To minimize the cost, we should identify the smallest subarray where all elements can be made equal.
   - The provided function does not calculate the minimum cost but rather returns the length of a subarray where the first pair of unequal elements is found.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the test case `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`, the function would incorrectly return `4` instead of `2` (by setting the subarray `[2, 4]` to `2`).
   - For the test case `[4, 3, 2, 7, 1, 1, 3]`, the function would return `6` instead of `4` (by setting the subarray `[2, 5]` to `1`).

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
