Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]`.
2. **Determine the variables involved in the loop condition**: The variables involved are `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.
3. **Analyze the current state**: The current state is given as `i is greater than j`. This means `i > j`, but there is no information about the values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.

For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `arr[i] == arr[i + 1]` must be true. Since we don't have any specific values for `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, we need to ensure that these two elements are equal.

Given that `i > j`, we need to make sure that `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are equal. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

**State:**
- `i is greater than j`
- `arr[i] must be equal to arr[i + 1]`

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i is greater than j` and `arr[i] must be equal to arr[i + 1]`**
