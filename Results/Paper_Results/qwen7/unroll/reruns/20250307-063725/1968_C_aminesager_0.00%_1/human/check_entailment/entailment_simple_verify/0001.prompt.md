You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `T`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes the list `a` with a single element `[1000]`. This is the starting point for constructing the array `a`.

3. **Constructing Array `a`:**
   - For each subsequent element in the list `T`, it calculates `a[i]` as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
   - However, this approach might not always produce valid results because the modulo operation requires `a_i > x_i` and `a_{i-1} > x_i`. The current logic does not ensure these conditions.

4. **Reversing the List:**
   - After constructing the list `a`, it reverses it and prints the result.

### Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through the example provided in the problem statement:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `4 2 4 1`
- Initial `a` is `[1000]`.
- For `i = 1`: `a[1] = a[0] - T[0] = 1000 - 2 = 998`.
- For `i = 2`: `a[2] = a[1] - T[1] = 998 - 4 = 994`.
- For `i = 3`: `a[3] = a[2] - T[2] = 994 - 1 = 993`.
- Reversed `a` is `[993, 994, 998, 1000]`.

This does not satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.

### Correct Approach

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that `a_i > x_i` and `a_{i-1} > x_i` and that the modulo condition holds. One possible approach is to set `a_1` to a large value and then adjust subsequent values to satisfy the conditions.

### Corrected Program

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        n = int(input())
        line = input()
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        # Initialize a with a large value for a_1
        a = [1000000000]
        
        # Construct the array a
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append((a[i - 1] + T[i - 1]) // 1)
        
        # Reverse the list and print the result
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        print(result)

func()
```

### Conclusion

The original program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not ensure that the modulo condition is met. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.
