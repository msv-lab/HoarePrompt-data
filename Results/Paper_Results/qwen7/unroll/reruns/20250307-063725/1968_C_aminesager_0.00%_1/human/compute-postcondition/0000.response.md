Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and it is the integer input by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this line of code.
