Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
4
2 4 1
```

Expected output:
```
3 5 4 9
```

However, the program generates:
```
3 1 3 8
```

This is incorrect because:
- `a_2 \bmod a_1 = 1 \bmod 3 = 1`, which matches `x_2`.
- `a_3 \bmod a_2 = 3 \bmod 1 = 3`, which does not match `x_3`.

The issue lies in the logic used to construct the array `a`. The current implementation does not ensure that the modulo condition is met for all subsequent elements. A correct approach would involve constructing `a` such that each element satisfies the required modulo condition.
