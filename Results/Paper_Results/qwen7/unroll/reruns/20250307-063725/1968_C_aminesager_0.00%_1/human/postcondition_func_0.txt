The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, a list `T` of `n-1` integers, and an integer `t`. For each test case, it calculates the reversed cumulative subtraction of the input sequence `T` and prints the result. After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any specific value.
