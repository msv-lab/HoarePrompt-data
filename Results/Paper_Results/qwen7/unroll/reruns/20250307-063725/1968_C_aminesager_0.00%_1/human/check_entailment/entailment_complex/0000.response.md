Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It also correctly reads the value of `n` and the list `T` for each test case.

2. **Array Initialization**: The initial value of `a` is set to `[1000]`. This is a reasonable starting point since the problem specifies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

3. **Array Construction**: The loop constructs the array `a` by appending values based on the previous element and the corresponding value from `T`. Specifically, for each `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i - 1] - T[i - 1]`.

4. **Reversal and Output**: The array `a` is then reversed and printed as a space-separated string. This step ensures that the output matches the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases appropriately, such as the minimum possible value for `a_i` being 1 (though it starts with 1000, which is within the allowed range).

6. **Correctness of Logic**: The logic used to construct the array `a` is correct according to the problem statement. The condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) is satisfied by the construction method.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
