Output State: **The output state will be a series of lists, each representing the reversed cumulative subtraction of the input sequence T for each test case.**

Explanation: The loop processes each test case defined by the user. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a line of space-separated integers `T`. It then calculates a new list `a` where each element is derived from the previous one by subtracting the corresponding element in `T`. After processing all elements, the list `a` is reversed and printed. Since the loop runs until `t` becomes 0, the final output will consist of the results for each test case, with each result being the reversed cumulative subtraction of the input sequence `T`.
