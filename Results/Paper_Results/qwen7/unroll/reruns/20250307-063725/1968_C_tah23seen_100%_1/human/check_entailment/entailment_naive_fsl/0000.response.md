Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function may not always produce valid results. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
1000000000 1000000000
```

This is because the function initializes `ans` with `10^9` and then tries to calculate `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. When `arr[i]` is larger than `ans[i + 1]`, this subtraction will not yield a valid result. In the example above, `ans[0]` is initialized to `10^9`, and subtracting `1` from it does not change its value, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the function should ensure that `ans[i]` is at least `arr[i] + 1` to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This ensures that each `a_i` is at least `arr[i-1] + 1`, which guarantees that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.
