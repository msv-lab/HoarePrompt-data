#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans is a list of n elements where the first element is the difference between the second and the first element of arr, the second element is the difference between the third and the second element of arr, and so on, with each subsequent element being the difference between the next element in arr and the previous one in ans; the last element of ans is -arr[-1].
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element is the difference between the next element in `arr` and the previous one in `ans`, and the last element is -`arr[-1]`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` containing `n-1` integers and an integer `n`, and returns a list `ans` where each element is the difference between the next element in `arr` and the previous one, with the last element being `-arr[-1]`.
