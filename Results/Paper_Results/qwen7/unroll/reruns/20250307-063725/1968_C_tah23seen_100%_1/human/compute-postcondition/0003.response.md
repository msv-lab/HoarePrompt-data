Output State: **ans is a list of n elements where the first element is the difference between the second and the first element of arr, the second element is the difference between the third and the second element of arr, and so on, with each subsequent element being the difference between the next element in arr and the previous one in ans; the last element of ans is -arr[-1].**

To break it down further:
- The loop starts with `i` as `n - 2`.
- In each iteration, `ans[i]` is updated to be the value of `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`.
- As `i` decreases, the loop continues until `i` becomes -1.
- After the loop completes, `ans[0]` will be `ans[1] - arr[0]`, `ans[1]` will be `ans[2] - arr[1]`, and so on, with `ans[n-2]` being `ans[n-1] - arr[n-2]` and `ans[n-1]` being `-arr[n-1]`.
