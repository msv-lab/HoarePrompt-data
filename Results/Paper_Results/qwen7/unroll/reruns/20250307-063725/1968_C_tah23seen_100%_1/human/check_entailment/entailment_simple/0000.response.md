Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing an array \(a\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution attempts to construct \(a\) by setting \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\) for \(i\) from \(n-2\) down to \(0\). This approach is flawed because it does not guarantee that \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i\).

To see why this is incorrect, consider the following:
- If \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\), then \(a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) will generally not equal \(x_i\) unless \(a_{i+1}\) is chosen carefully to satisfy the modulo condition.
- The proposed solution does not ensure that the constructed \(a_i\) values will satisfy the required modulo conditions.

A correct approach would involve starting from \(a_1\) and ensuring that each subsequent \(a_i\) can be derived to satisfy the modulo condition. One possible correct method is to set \(a_1\) to a large value (e.g., \(10^9\)) and then iteratively adjust \(a_i\) to satisfy the modulo condition.

Given the current implementation, the constructed array \(ans\) does not necessarily satisfy the required modulo conditions for all \(x_i\).

Correctness: **False**
