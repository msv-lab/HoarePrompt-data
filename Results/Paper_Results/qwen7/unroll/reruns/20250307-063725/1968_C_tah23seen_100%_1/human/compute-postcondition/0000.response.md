Output State: **arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and ans is a list of n elements, each element is 10^9.**

The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, where each element is set to `10 ** 9`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged.
