The only variable in the loop head is `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute.

Right before the loop, `i` is `n - 2`. For the loop to execute the first time, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0. Given that `2 ≤ n ≤ 500`, the smallest possible value for `n` is 2, which means `i` would be `0` (since `i = n - 2`). Therefore, `i` being `n - 2` already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and `ans` is a list of n elements, each element is 10^9; `i` is n - 2 and must be greater than or equal to 0**
