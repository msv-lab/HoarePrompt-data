You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        i -= 1
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    n = int(input())
    arr = [int(x) for x in input().split(' ')]
    ans = func_1(arr, n)
    for i in ans:
        print(i, end=' ')
    print()
    t -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500.
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [10 ** 9] * n
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0:
        ans[i] = ans[i + 1] - arr[i]
        
        i -= 1
        
    #State: ans is a list of n elements where the first element is the difference between the second and the first element of arr, the second element is the difference between the third and the second element of arr, and so on, with each subsequent element being the difference between the next element in arr and the previous one in ans; the last element of ans is -arr[-1].
    return ans
    #The program returns a list `ans` where each element is the difference between the next element in `arr` and the previous one in `ans`, and the last element is -`arr[-1]`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function may not always produce valid results. Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
2
1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
1 2
```

However, the current implementation will produce:
```
1000000000 1000000000
```

This is because the function initializes `ans` with `10^9` and then tries to calculate `ans[i]` as `ans[i + 1] - arr[i]`. When `arr[i]` is larger than `ans[i + 1]`, this subtraction will not yield a valid result. In the example above, `ans[0]` is initialized to `10^9`, and subtracting `1` from it does not change its value, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the function should ensure that `ans[i]` is at least `arr[i] + 1` to satisfy the condition `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(arr, n):
    ans = [1] * n
    for i in range(1, n):
        ans[i] = ans[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    return ans
```

This ensures that each `a_i` is at least `arr[i-1] + 1`, which guarantees that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` holds true.
