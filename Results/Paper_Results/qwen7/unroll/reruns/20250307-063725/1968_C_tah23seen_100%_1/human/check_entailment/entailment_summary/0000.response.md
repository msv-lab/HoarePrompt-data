Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array \(a_1, \dots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
2. The provided solution attempts to generate such an array using the formula \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\), starting from the end of the array.
3. However, this approach may not always produce a valid solution because:
   - The formula \(a_i = a_{i+1} - x_i\) does not guarantee that \(a_i \geq 1\) and \(a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - It also does not ensure that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

Given the execution summary, it seems the function `func_1` is trying to construct the array by setting each element as the difference between the next element and the corresponding \(x_i\). This approach is flawed because:
- It does not account for the modulo operation.
- It does not ensure the constraints \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that each \(a_i\) is chosen such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). One possible correct approach is to set \(a_1\) to be large enough and then iteratively adjust subsequent \(a_i\) values to satisfy the modulo condition.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
