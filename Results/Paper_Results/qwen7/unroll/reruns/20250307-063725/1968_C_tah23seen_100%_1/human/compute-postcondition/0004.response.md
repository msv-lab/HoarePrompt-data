Output State: **The program returns a list `ans` where each element is the difference between the next element in `arr` and the previous one in `ans`, and the last element is -`arr[-1]`.**

This means that the program returns a list `ans` that is constructed by taking the differences between consecutive elements of the input list `arr`, starting from the first difference (second element minus the first) and continuing until the last element of `ans` is set to the negative of the last element of `arr`.
