Output State: **`arr` is a list of n-1 integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 500), where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500, and `ans` is a list of n elements, each element is 10^9; `i` is n - 2.**

This means that the variable `i` has been assigned the value `n - 2`. The lists `arr` and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state.
