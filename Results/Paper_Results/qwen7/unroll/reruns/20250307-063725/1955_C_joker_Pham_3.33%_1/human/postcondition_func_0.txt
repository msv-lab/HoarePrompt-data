The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of positive integers. The function processes the list `a` by comparing elements at indices `l` and `r`, which are initially set to 0 and `n-1` respectively. It repeatedly reduces the elements `a[l]` and `a[r]` by their minimum value up to twice, as long as `k` allows, and counts the number of times this operation can be performed. The function returns the count of such operations (`sunks`). If `k` becomes zero or the indices `l` and `r` cross each other, the loop terminates.
