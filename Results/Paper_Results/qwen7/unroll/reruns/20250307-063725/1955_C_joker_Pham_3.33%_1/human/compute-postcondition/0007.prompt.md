You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, k is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and a is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9.
def func_1(n, k, a):
    l, r = 0, n - 1
    sunks = 0
    while l <= r:
        if k == 0:
            break
        
        if l == r:
            if k >= a[r]:
                sunks += 1
                break

        if a[r] < a[l]:
            if k >= a[r] * 2:
                k -= a[r] * 2
                a[l] -= a[r]
                if a[l] == 0:

                    l += 1
                sunks += 1
                r -= 1
                continue
            elif a[r] * 2 - 1 == k:
                sunks += 1

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer (since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, `l` is `n`, `r` is -1, `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero; if so, it breaks immediately. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and if so, increments `sunks` and breaks. Otherwise, it also breaks.
    #
    #The main logic of the loop involves comparing `a[l]` and `a[r]` and adjusting them based on the value of `k`. It subtracts `a[l]` or `a[r]` from each other twice if `k` is large enough, and decreases `k` accordingly. If one of the elements becomes zero, it increments `sunks` and adjusts the indices `l` or `r`.
    #
    #The loop ends when `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero. At this point, `l` will be set to `n` and `r` will be `-1` because they are updated inside the loop until `l > r`. The variable `sunks` keeps track of how many times the conditions were met to reduce elements in the list `a`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9. It returns the count (`sunks`) of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `sunks`, which is the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
