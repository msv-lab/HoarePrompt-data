You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer (since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, `l` is `n`, `r` is -1, `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero; if so, it breaks immediately. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and if so, increments `sunks` and breaks. Otherwise, it also breaks.
    #
    #The main logic of the loop involves comparing `a[l]` and `a[r]` and adjusting them based on the value of `k`. It subtracts `a[l]` or `a[r]` from each other twice if `k` is large enough, and decreases `k` accordingly. If one of the elements becomes zero, it increments `sunks` and adjusts the indices `l` or `r`.
    #
    #The loop ends when `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero. At this point, `l` will be set to `n` and `r` will be `-1` because they are updated inside the loop until `l > r`. The variable `sunks` keeps track of how many times the conditions were met to reduce elements in the list `a`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the parsed values and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there is only one ship left (`l == r`), and if so, it checks if the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - If there are multiple ships, it alternates between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships based on their durability.
     - If the leftmost ship has more or equal durability than the rightmost ship, it attacks the leftmost ship twice (if possible).
     - If the rightmost ship has more durability, it attacks the rightmost ship twice (if possible).
   - After each attack, it updates the durability of the attacked ship and increments the `sunks` counter if the ship sinks.
   - The loop breaks when either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - It ensures that the loop stops when there are no more ships to attack or when `k` becomes zero.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed by the main program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks on the ships according to the problem description. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.
