    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer (since the loop breaks when `k` becomes 0), `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, `l` is `n`, `r` is -1, `sunks` is an integer representing the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.
    #
    #The loop continues to execute as long as `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Inside the loop, it checks if `k` is zero; if so, it breaks immediately. If `l` equals `r`, it checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `a[r]`, and if so, increments `sunks` and breaks. Otherwise, it also breaks.
    #
    #The main logic of the loop involves comparing `a[l]` and `a[r]` and adjusting them based on the value of `k`. It subtracts `a[l]` or `a[r]` from each other twice if `k` is large enough, and decreases `k` accordingly. If one of the elements becomes zero, it increments `sunks` and adjusts the indices `l` or `r`.
    #
    #The loop ends when `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero. At this point, `l` will be set to `n` and `r` will be `-1` because they are updated inside the loop until `l > r`. The variable `sunks` keeps track of how many times the conditions were met to reduce elements in the list `a`.
    return sunks
    #The program returns `sunks`, which is the number of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of positive integers. The function processes the list `a` by comparing elements at indices `l` and `r`, which are initially set to 0 and `n-1` respectively. It repeatedly reduces the elements `a[l]` and `a[r]` by their minimum value up to twice, as long as `k` allows, and counts the number of times this operation can be performed. The function returns the count of such operations (`sunks`). If `k` becomes zero or the indices `l` and `r` cross each other, the loop terminates.
