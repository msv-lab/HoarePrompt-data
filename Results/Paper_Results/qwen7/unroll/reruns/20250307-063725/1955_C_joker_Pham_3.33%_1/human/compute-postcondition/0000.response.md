Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 1.**

Explanation: The code initializes two new variables `l` and `r`. `l` is set to 0, and `r` is set to `n - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
