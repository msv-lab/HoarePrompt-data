Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.
2. The function `func_1` initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
3. The function iterates through the list of ships, reducing the durability of the ships and counting the number of sunk ships (`sunks`) based on the given rules.
4. The logic inside the loop correctly handles the alternating attacks on the first and last ships, updating the durability and counting the sunk ships appropriately.
5. The function correctly handles the cases where a ship's durability drops to zero, and the loop breaks when `k` becomes zero or when `l` exceeds `r`.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the function appears to correctly simulate the attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
