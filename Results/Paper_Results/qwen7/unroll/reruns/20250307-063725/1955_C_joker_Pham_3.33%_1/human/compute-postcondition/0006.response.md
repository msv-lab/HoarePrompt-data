Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer not exceeding 10^15, and `a` is a list of positive integers not exceeding 10^9. It returns the count (`sunks`) of times the condition `k >= a[l] * 2` or `k >= a[r] * 2` was satisfied before breaking the loop.**
