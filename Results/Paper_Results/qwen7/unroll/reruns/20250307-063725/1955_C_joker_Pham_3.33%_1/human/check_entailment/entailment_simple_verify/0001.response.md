### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.
   - This part is correct and well-implemented.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the parsed values and prints the result.
   - This part is correct and well-implemented.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there is only one ship left (`l == r`), and if so, it checks if the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - If there are multiple ships, it alternates between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships based on their durability.
     - If the leftmost ship has more or equal durability than the rightmost ship, it attacks the leftmost ship twice (if possible).
     - If the rightmost ship has more durability, it attacks the rightmost ship twice (if possible).
   - After each attack, it updates the durability of the attacked ship and increments the `sunks` counter if the ship sinks.
   - The loop breaks when either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

   **Key Issues Identified:**
   - The function uses `map(int, input().split())` to read the durability values of the ships, but it should use `list(map(int, input().split()))` instead. This is because `map` returns a map object, and we need a list to store the durability values.
   - The function does not handle the case where the durability of a ship is reduced to zero but still has some remaining attacks (`k` is greater than zero). This can lead to incorrect results if the ship is attacked again without checking if it has already sunk.
   - The function does not properly handle the case where the durability of the ship is reduced to zero but the remaining attacks are insufficient to sink the ship completely. This can lead to incorrect counting of sunk ships.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - However, it does not handle the case where the durability of a ship is reduced to zero but still has some remaining attacks (`k` is greater than zero). This can lead to incorrect results if the ship is attacked again without checking if it has already sunk.
   - The function does not ensure that the loop stops when there are no more ships to attack or when `k` becomes zero in all scenarios.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed by the main program.
   - However, due to the issues mentioned above, the output may be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The provided program has logical errors and does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, it does not properly handle the scenario where a ship's durability is reduced to zero but still has some remaining attacks, leading to incorrect counting of sunk ships.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
