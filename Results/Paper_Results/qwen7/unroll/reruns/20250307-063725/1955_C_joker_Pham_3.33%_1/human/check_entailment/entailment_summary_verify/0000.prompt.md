You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `a`. Here, `n` is the length of the list `a`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `a` is a list of positive integers. The function processes the list `a` by comparing elements at indices `l` and `r`, which are initially set to 0 and `n-1` respectively. It repeatedly reduces the elements `a[l]` and `a[r]` by their minimum value up to twice, as long as `k` allows, and counts the number of times this operation can be performed. The function returns the count of such operations (`sunks`). If `k` becomes zero or the indices `l` and `r` cross each other, the loop terminates.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks on the ships. Specifically, the logic for handling the attacks is flawed. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Durability Reduction**: The program attempts to reduce the durability of the ships in a way that doesn't accurately reflect the Kraken's attacks. For instance, the program subtracts the durability of the first and last ships from each other, which is not correct according to the problem description.

2. **Incorrect Break Conditions**: The conditions under which the loop breaks are not correctly implemented. For example, the program should continue attacking until `k` becomes zero, but the current implementation breaks prematurely in certain scenarios.

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Sunk Ships**: The program increments the `sunks` counter incorrectly. It should only increment `sunks` when a ship's durability reaches zero, but the current logic does not handle this correctly.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

In this case, the program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks, leading to an incorrect result. The program fails to account for the alternating nature of the attacks and the reduction of durability correctly. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
