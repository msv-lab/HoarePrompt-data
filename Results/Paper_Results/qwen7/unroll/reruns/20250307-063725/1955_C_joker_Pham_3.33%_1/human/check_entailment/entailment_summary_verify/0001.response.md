### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the parsed values and prints the result.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there is only one ship left (`l == r`), and if so, it checks if the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - If there are multiple ships, it alternates between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships based on their durability.
     - If the leftmost ship has more or equal durability than the rightmost ship, it attacks the leftmost ship twice (if possible).
     - If the rightmost ship has more durability, it attacks the rightmost ship twice (if possible).
   - After each attack, it updates the durability of the attacked ship and increments the `sunks` counter if the ship sinks.
   - The loop breaks when either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - It ensures that the loop stops when there are no more ships to attack or when `k` becomes zero.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed by the main program.

However, upon closer inspection, there are some issues with the logic in `func_1`:

- **Incorrect Attack Logic**: The function incorrectly handles the attack logic. Specifically, it only reduces the durability by twice the minimum value of the two ships being compared. This does not accurately simulate the Kraken's attack pattern, which should reduce the durability by 1 each time.

- **Incorrect Break Conditions**: The function breaks the loop prematurely when `k` becomes zero, but it should continue to check the durability of the ships even if `k` is not enough to sink them completely.

Let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Example Input**:
  ```
  4 5
  1 2 4 3
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  2
  ```

- **Actual Behavior**:
  - The function correctly identifies that the first ship sinks after the first attack.
  - However, it incorrectly handles the subsequent attacks, leading to an incorrect count of sunk ships.

To fix these issues, the function needs to correctly simulate the Kraken's attack by reducing the durability by 1 each time and updating the pointers accordingly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the Kraken's attacks. The function `func_1` has logical errors in its attack and loop handling.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
