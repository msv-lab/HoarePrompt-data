Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input and calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments.
2. The function `func_1` initializes the left (`l`) and right (`r`) pointers and a counter (`sunks`) to keep track of the number of ships sunk.
3. The function iterates through the list `a` using the two pointers, reducing the durability of the ships based on the value of `k` and updating the `sunks` counter.
4. The logic within the function correctly handles the conditions where `k` is reduced by twice the minimum durability of the two ships being compared, and it correctly updates the indices and the `sunks` counter.
5. The function correctly handles the case where `l` equals `r` and ensures that the loop terminates appropriately when `k` becomes zero or when `l` exceeds `r`.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
