### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the durability values of the ships into a list `a`.

2. **Function Call**:
   - The program calls `func_1(n, k, a)` with the parsed values and prints the result.
   
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to represent the leftmost and rightmost ships, respectively.
   - It also initializes a counter `sunks` to count the number of sunk ships.
   - The function uses a while loop to simulate the Kraken's attacks until either `l` exceeds `r` or `k` becomes zero.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if there is only one ship left (`l == r`), and if so, it checks if the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - If there are multiple ships, it alternates between attacking the leftmost and rightmost ships based on their durability.
     - If the leftmost ship has more or equal durability than the rightmost ship, it attacks the leftmost ship twice (if possible).
     - If the rightmost ship has more durability, it attacks the rightmost ship twice (if possible).
   - After each attack, it updates the durability of the attacked ship and increments the `sunks` counter if the ship sinks.
   - The loop breaks when either all ships are sunk or there are no more attacks left.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the remaining ship can be sunk with the remaining attacks.
   - It ensures that the loop stops when there are no more ships to attack or when `k` becomes zero.

5. **Output**:
   - The function returns the total number of sunk ships, which is printed by the main program.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly simulates the Kraken's attacks on the ships according to the problem description. It handles all the necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
