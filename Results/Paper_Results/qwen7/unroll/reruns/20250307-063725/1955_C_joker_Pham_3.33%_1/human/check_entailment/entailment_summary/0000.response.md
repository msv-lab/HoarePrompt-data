Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the attacks of the Kraken on a list of ships with varying durability. The Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ship until all ships sink or there are no more attacks left.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the first and last ship, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to process the ships until either `k` attacks are exhausted or the pointers cross each other.
   - Inside the loop, it checks whether the current ship at `l` or `r` has durability left and reduces the durability of both ships by the minimum of their durabilities up to twice.
   - If a ship's durability reaches zero, it is considered sunk, and the corresponding pointer is adjusted.
   - The function correctly handles the alternating attack pattern and ensures that ships are only attacked if they have not sunk.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `l` and `r` converge to the same ship.
   - It ensures that the number of attacks `k` is reduced appropriately and does not exceed the available attacks.
   - The function respects the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

4. **Output Verification**:
   - The function returns the count of sunk ships, which matches the expected output format.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to simulate the Kraken's attacks and count the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **True**
