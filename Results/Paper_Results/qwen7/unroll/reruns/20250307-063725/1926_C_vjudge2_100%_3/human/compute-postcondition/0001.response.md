Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `a` is 0.
   - `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `num != 0` must be true. Since `num` is given as a positive integer within the specified range, it already satisfies this condition.

Given that `num` is a positive integer and the loop condition `num != 0` is inherently satisfied by any positive integer, no adjustments are needed to the state of `num`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains the same.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
