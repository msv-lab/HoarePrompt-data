Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly compute the sum of the numbers after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits. The main issue lies in the pre-computation of sums in the array `A`. This approach is inefficient and unnecessary for each test case, but more importantly, it does not handle the problem correctly.

The program should directly compute the sum for each test case without pre-computing all sums up to 200,000. Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Pre-computation Issue**: The array `A` is pre-computed for all numbers from 1 to 200,000, which is unnecessary and inefficient. It also doesn’t account for the fact that the sum of digits for numbers greater than 200,000 would be incorrect.

2. **Logic Error**: The logic for computing the sum of digits in `func_1` is correct, but the way the results are stored and retrieved is flawed. The array `A` is not used correctly to get the sum for a specific `n`.

To fix this, the program should directly compute the sum for each test case within the loop. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

This corrected version ensures that the sum is computed correctly for each test case without any pre-computation issues.
