Reasoning:
1. The provided program has a significant flaw in how it handles test cases.
2. The array `A` is precomputed and filled with sums up to 200,000 in the first loop. This is unnecessary and inefficient since the program only needs to compute the required sum for each test case individually.
3. The second loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one by printing the corresponding value from the precomputed array `A`. However, this approach fails because:
   - The array `A` is not reset between test cases, so the values will be cumulative.
   - The index `n-1` used to access `A` does not correctly reflect the sum for the current test case but rather the sum for all previous test cases up to `n`.

Given these issues, the program will produce incorrect results for most test cases due to the cumulative nature of the array `A`.

Correctness: **False**
