### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then runs a loop from 1 to 200000 (inclusive) and for each number, it calls `func_1` to get the sum of its digits.
   - The result of `func_1` is added to `sum`, and `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It iteratively extracts the last digit using `num % 10` and adds it to `a`, then removes the last digit using integer division `int(num / 10)` until `num` becomes 0.

3. **Test Cases Handling:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `t` (the number of test cases) and then processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` for each test case and prints `A[n - 1]`, which is the precomputed sum of the numbers after replacing each number with the sum of its digits up to `n`.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The precomputation part runs in \(O(n)\) where \(n = 200000\).
   - Each test case is processed in constant time \(O(1)\), making the overall complexity efficient enough to meet the 0.5-second time limit.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits in `func_1` is correct.
   - However, the precomputation part is unnecessary and incorrect. The program precomputes the sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000, but the problem only requires the sum for numbers up to \(n\) where \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). This means that the precomputation list `A` will have many unused elements, and the program will still need to compute the required sum for each test case, which is redundant.

Given that the problem only requires the sum of the numbers after replacing each number with the sum of its digits up to \(n\), the precomputation step is not necessary and does not contribute to the correctness of the solution. The program should directly compute the sum for each test case without storing intermediate results.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the precomputation step is necessary and correct. While the logic within the `func_1` function is correct, the overall approach is inefficient and unnecessary.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
