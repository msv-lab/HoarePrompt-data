### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Precomputation:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` set to 0.
   - It then runs a loop from 1 to 200000 (inclusive) and for each number, it calls `func_1` to get the sum of its digits.
   - The result of `func_1` is added to `sum`, and `sum` is appended to the list `A`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It iteratively extracts the last digit using `num % 10` and adds it to `a`, then removes the last digit using integer division `int(num / 10)` until `num` becomes 0.

3. **Test Cases Handling:**
   - For each test case, the program reads `t` (the number of test cases) and then processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` for each test case and prints `A[n - 1]`, which is the precomputed sum of the numbers after replacing each number with the sum of its digits up to `n`.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The precomputation part runs in \(O(n)\) where \(n = 200000\).
   - Each test case is processed in constant time \(O(1)\), making the overall complexity efficient enough to meet the 0.5-second time limit.

5. **Correctness:**
   - The logic for calculating the sum of digits in `func_1` is correct.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the way the precomputed sums are stored in the list `A`. Specifically, the list `A` is storing the cumulative sum of the sums of digits up to each number, not the individual sums of digits. Therefore, `A[n - 1]` will not give the correct answer for the sum of the numbers after replacing each number with the sum of its digits up to `n`.

### Example to Illustrate the Issue:
For `n = 3`:
- The numbers written on the board are: 1, 2, 3.
- The sums of their digits are: 1, 2, 3.
- The correct sum should be: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
- But `A[2]` (since `n - 1 = 2`) will contain the cumulative sum: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is correct but not the intended result.

However, for `n = 4`:
- The numbers written on the board are: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The sums of their digits are: 1, 2, 3, 4.
- The correct sum should be: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
- But `A[3]` will contain the cumulative sum: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10, which again is correct but not the intended result.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly compute the required sum of the numbers after replacing each number with the sum of its digits. The list `A` should store the individual sums of digits, not the cumulative sums.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
