Output State: **a is the sum of all digits of the original num.**

Explanation: The loop iteratively extracts the last digit of `num` using `num % 10`, adds it to `a`, and then removes the last digit from `num` using `int(num / 10)`. This process continues until `num` becomes 0. Therefore, after the loop completes, `a` will hold the sum of all digits of the original value of `num`.
