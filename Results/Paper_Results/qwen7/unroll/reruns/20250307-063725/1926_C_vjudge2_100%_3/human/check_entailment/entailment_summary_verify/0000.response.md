### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description:
- Vladislav writes integers from 1 to \( n \) on the board.
- Each integer is replaced with the sum of its digits.
- We need to find the sum of these new numbers.

#### Given Program:
```python
A = []
sum = 0
for i in range(1, 200001):
    a = func_1(i)
    sum = sum + a
    A.append(sum)
for t in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(A[n - 1])
```

#### Function Summary:
- `func_1(num)` computes the sum of the digits of `num`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Pre-computation Issue**:
   - The program pre-computes the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`.
   - This approach is inefficient because it computes sums for numbers that are not needed for the test cases.
   - Moreover, the list `A` contains the cumulative sum of digit sums up to each index, which is not what we need.

2. **Logic Error**:
   - The program retrieves the sum for a specific \( n \) from the list `A`, which is incorrect.
   - For example, `A[11]` will contain the sum of digit sums from 1 to 12, not just the sum of digit sums for numbers from 1 to 12.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - The correct approach is to directly compute the sum of digit sums for each test case.
   - The function `func_1` is correct, but the way the results are handled is incorrect.

#### Corrected Program:
```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a = a + num % 10
        num = int(num / 10)
    return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was accurate. The program is incorrect due to the pre-computation and incorrect handling of the results. The corrected version provided above directly computes the required sum for each test case, ensuring correctness.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
