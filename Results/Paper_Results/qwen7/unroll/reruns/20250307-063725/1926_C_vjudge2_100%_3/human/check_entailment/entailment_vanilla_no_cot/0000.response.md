Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes and stores the sum of the digit sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 in the list `A`. This is unnecessary and inefficient because the problem requires processing each test case independently without needing to store intermediate results.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Precomputation**: Even if we were to use precomputation, the logic to compute the digit sum for each number is correct, but the way the cumulative sums are stored and used is flawed. The list `A` should not be constructed in such a manner; instead, it should directly compute the required sum for each test case.

3. **Time Complexity**: Given the constraints (t ≤ 10^4 and n ≤ 2⋅10^5), precomputing the sums for all numbers up to 200000 is not feasible within the time limit. The solution should focus on computing the required sum for each test case efficiently.

### Corrected Program:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def digit_sum(num):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = sum(digit_sum(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    print(total_sum)
```

This version avoids precomputation and directly computes the required sum for each test case, which is both efficient and correct.
