Reasoning:

1. The program aims to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer from 1 to `n` with the sum of its digits.
2. The program precomputes the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is inefficient but works within the given constraints.
3. For each test case, it correctly retrieves the precomputed sum from the list `A` and prints it.
4. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number.
5. However, there is a logical error in the way the sums are being stored in the list `A`. Specifically, the sum `sum` in the loop is not reset for each number, leading to incorrect results for `n > 1`.

To illustrate the issue:
- When `n = 2`, the expected sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- But due to the cumulative nature of `sum`, the value in `A[1]` will be `1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 1 + 2` (the sum of all previous numbers plus the current number), which is incorrect.

Given the above reasoning, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the sum of the digits for each number independently.

Correctness: **False**
