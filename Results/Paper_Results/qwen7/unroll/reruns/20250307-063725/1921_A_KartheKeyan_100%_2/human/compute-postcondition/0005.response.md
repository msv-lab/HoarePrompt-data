Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes four lines of input, each containing two integers x_i and y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It returns a value indicating whether a valid square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area can be formed from the given points.**

Note: The actual processing logic to determine if a valid square can be formed is not described here, only the input and output characteristics of the function.
