Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has a logical error in calculating the side length of the square. The program attempts to calculate the distance between two points and then multiplies these distances to get the area, which is incorrect. For a square, both distances should be equal and represent the side length of the square. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    while n:
        coord = []
        for i in range(4):
            (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
            coord.append((x, y))
        
        # Calculate all pairwise distances
        distances = [
            (coord[i][0] - coord[j][0])**2 + (coord[i][1] - coord[j][1])**2
            for i in range(4) for j in range(i+1, 4)
        ]
        
        # Find the minimum distance, which should be the side length squared
        min_distance = min(distances)
        
        # The area of the square is the side length squared
        area = math.sqrt(min_distance)
        
        print(int(area))
        n -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version calculates all pairwise distances between the points, finds the minimum distance (which should be the side length squared), and then computes the area correctly.
