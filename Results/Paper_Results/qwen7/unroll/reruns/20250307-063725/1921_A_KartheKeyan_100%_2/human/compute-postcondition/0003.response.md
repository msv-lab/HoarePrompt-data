Output State: The output state will be a series of printed results, each representing the rounded area of a quadrilateral defined by four points (x, y) entered by the user for each iteration of the loop. The loop will execute until `n` becomes 0, at which point it will stop.

To clarify, if `n` was initially set to some positive integer value, say `n = 5`, the loop would run 5 times. Each time, the user would be prompted to enter four pairs of coordinates. After sorting these coordinates, the loop calculates the area of the quadrilateral formed by these points using the distances between specific pairs of points and prints the result rounded to the nearest integer. After all iterations, no further values of `n` or any other variables from within the loop will be defined, as the loop has completed its execution.
