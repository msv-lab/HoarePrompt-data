There are four lines of input for each testcase, each containing two integers x_i, y_i representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. The coordinates satisfy -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000. It is guaranteed that there exists a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area among the given points.
