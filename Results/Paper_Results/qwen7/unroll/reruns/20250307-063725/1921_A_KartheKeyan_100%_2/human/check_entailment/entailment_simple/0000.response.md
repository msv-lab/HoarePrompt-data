Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its four corners. The square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, and the coordinates are provided in no particular order.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, which helps in identifying the pairs of opposite corners.
   - It calculates the squared distance between the first and second points and the third and fourth points, assuming they are opposite corners of the square.
   - It computes the geometric mean of these distances, which should give the side length of the square.
   - Finally, it prints the area of the square, which is the square of the side length.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The sorting step ensures that the pairs of opposite corners are identified correctly.
   - The calculation of the squared distances and the geometric mean is appropriate for finding the side length of the square.
   - The area calculation is done correctly by squaring the side length.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the constraints correctly, including the range of coordinates and the guarantee that a valid square exists.
   - The geometric mean calculation is appropriate for this problem since the distances are squared before taking the square root.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is the area of the square, which is correctly calculated and rounded.

Based on the analysis, the given code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
