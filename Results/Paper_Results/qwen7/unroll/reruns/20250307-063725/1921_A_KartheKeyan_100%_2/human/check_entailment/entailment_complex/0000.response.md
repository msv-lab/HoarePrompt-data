Reasoning:

The provided code aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, the logic used in the code is flawed. Specifically, the code calculates the geometric mean of the distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points, which does not correctly represent the side length of the square.

Here's the correct approach:
1. The coordinates of the corners of the square should form two pairs of opposite corners.
2. The distance between any pair of opposite corners of the square should be the same and equal to \(2a\) where \(a\) is the side length of the square.
3. The correct way to find the side length \(a\) is to calculate the Euclidean distance between any two adjacent corners and use the relationship \(a^2 + a^2 = d^2\) where \(d\) is the distance between opposite corners.

Let's analyze the provided code:
- The code sorts the coordinates, but it incorrectly assumes that the distance between the first and second points and the third and fourth points are related to the side length of the square.
- The calculation of the geometric mean of these distances does not reflect the actual side length of the square.

Given the problem constraints and the need to find the area of the square, the correct approach would be to identify the side length \(a\) by calculating the distance between any two adjacent corners and then compute the area as \(a^2\).

Since the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to find the side length of the square, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
