Output State: The output state will consist of a series of printed results, each being the rounded geometric mean of the distances between two pairs of points from four given points. The number of such results will be equal to the initial value of `n`.

To break it down:
1. The loop runs `n` times.
2. In each iteration, the user is expected to provide coordinates for four points.
3. These points are sorted.
4. The distances between the first and second points, and the third and fourth points are calculated.
5. The geometric mean of these distances is computed and printed.
6. After printing, `n` is decremented by 1.

The final output state will be a list of `n` numbers, each representing the rounded geometric mean of the distances as described above.
