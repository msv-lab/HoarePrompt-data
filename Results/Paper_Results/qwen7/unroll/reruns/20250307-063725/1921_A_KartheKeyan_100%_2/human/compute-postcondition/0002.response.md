State right before the while loop, the variable `n` is `n-1`, and we are ready to calculate `s` for the next test case.
```
while n:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `n`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `n` must be non-zero (i.e., `n > 0`).

Given that `n` is `n-1` right before the loop, this means `n` was previously set to some value minus one. To ensure the loop executes at least once, `n` must be greater than 0 after being decremented.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
