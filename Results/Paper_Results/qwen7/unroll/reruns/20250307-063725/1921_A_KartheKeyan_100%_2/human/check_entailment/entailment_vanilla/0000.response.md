### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes and the input guarantees that these points form a square.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`n`).
   - For each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners.
   - It sorts the coordinates, but this sorting step is unnecessary since the problem guarantees that the points form a square and we can directly calculate the side length.
   - It calculates the squared distances between adjacent corners to determine the side length of the square.
   - It then prints the area of the square, which is the product of the side lengths.

3. **Correctness of Calculations**:
   - The distance between two adjacent corners should give the side length of the square.
   - Since the square's sides are parallel to the axes, the distance between any two adjacent corners will be the same and equal to the side length of the square.
   - The code calculates the squared distance between two adjacent corners and takes the square root to get the side length. Then it squares this value to get the area, which is correct.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles all the necessary steps correctly without any edge cases being missed.
   - The input constraints are respected, and the logic is sound.

5. **Output**:
   - The output is rounded to the nearest integer, which is appropriate for the area calculation.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. There are no logical errors or missing steps.

**Correctness: True**
