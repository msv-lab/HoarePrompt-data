The code reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l` and calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`. This value is then printed, and `n` is decremented by 1. After processing all test cases, the values of `n` and `l` are no longer relevant since they are not stored.

Since the initial state includes four lines of input for each test case, and the code only processes one line per test case, the remaining inputs are not used. The output state will include the calculated values of `s` for each test case.

Output State: **For each test case, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` and printed. The value of `n` is decremented by 1 after processing each test case.**
