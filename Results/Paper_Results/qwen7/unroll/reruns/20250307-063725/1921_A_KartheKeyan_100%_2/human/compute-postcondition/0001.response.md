The code reads an integer input for `n`. This input value is assigned to `n`, decrementing `n` by 1 after processing. The initial calculation of `s` is not performed here because the code only reads the input and does not execute the calculation or print `s`.

Output State: **`n` is `n-1`, and we are ready to calculate `s` for the next test case.**
