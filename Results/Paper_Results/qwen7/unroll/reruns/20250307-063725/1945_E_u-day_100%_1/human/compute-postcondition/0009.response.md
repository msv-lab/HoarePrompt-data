Output State: **low is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, and `st` is a set containing all the indices `mid` that were checked during the binary search process.**

Explanation: The loop performs a binary search on the array `arr` to find the first occurrence of the value `k`. The variable `low` and `high` are used to define the current search range, with `low` starting at 0 and `high` starting at `n`. The variable `pos` will be updated to the index of the first occurrence of `k` if found, otherwise it remains -1. The variable `st` collects all the mid indices that were checked during the binary search process. The loop continues until `low + 1` is no longer less than `high`.
