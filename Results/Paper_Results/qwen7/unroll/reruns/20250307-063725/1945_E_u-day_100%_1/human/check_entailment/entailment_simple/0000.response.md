Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation to ensure that the element `x` is at position `l` when performing a binary search.
2. The annotated program does not actually perform any swaps; it only prints out the number of swaps and the indices to be swapped, but does not execute the swaps themselves.
3. The logic inside `func_3()` does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm to find the position of `x` and rearrange the permutation. Instead, it checks if `arr[low]` equals `k` and prints 0 or 1 without performing any swaps.
4. The provided code does not handle the requirement to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps to place `x` at the start of the array before performing the binary search.
5. The annotated program's state and logic do not align with the problem requirements, indicating that the program is not correctly solving the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
