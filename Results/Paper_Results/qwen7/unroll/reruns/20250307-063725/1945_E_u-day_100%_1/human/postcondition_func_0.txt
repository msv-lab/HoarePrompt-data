The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into two parts, converts these parts into integers, and returns a map object containing these two integers. These integers represent the values of variables n and x, where n and x are constrained by specific ranges (1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5).
