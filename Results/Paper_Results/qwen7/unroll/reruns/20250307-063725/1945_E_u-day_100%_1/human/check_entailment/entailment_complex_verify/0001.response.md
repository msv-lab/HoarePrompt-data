### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires rearranging a permutation array such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is supposed to find `x` in the array, and we can make at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_2()**: This function converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - **func_3()**: This function performs the main logic.
     - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
     - It finds the index `pos` of `k` in the permutation array `arr`.
     - It performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly identifies the index `pos` of `k` in the array.
   - The binary search-like operation is implemented to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
   - The code handles the case where `k` is already at the correct position (`low`).
   - The code prints the required number of operations and the positions to swap, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is already at the correct position, no swaps are needed, and the code correctly prints `0`.
   - If `k` is not at the correct position, the code correctly identifies the positions to swap and prints them.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code follows the required format for outputting the number of operations and the positions to swap.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
   - The binary search-like operation does not guarantee that the correct position `low` is found. The variable `st` is used to store indices, but it is not utilized in the logic to determine the correct position.
   - The logic to determine the correct position `low` is flawed. The binary search-like operation does not ensure that `arr[low]` is the correct position for `k`.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
  
- **Test Case Processing**:
  - For each test case, `func_3()` is called.
  - Inside `func_3()`:
    - `n` and `k` are read using `func_1()`.
    - `arr` is constructed using `func_2()`.
    - `pos` is set to `-1` initially.
    - A loop iterates over the array to find the index of `k`.
    - `low` and `high` are initialized to `0` and `n` respectively.
    - A binary search-like operation is performed to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
    - If `arr[low]` equals `k`, it prints `0`.
    - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

### Issues Identified:
- The binary search-like operation does not guarantee that `arr[low]` is the correct position for `k`. The `st` set is not used effectively to determine the correct position.
- The logic to determine the correct position `low` is flawed because it does not ensure that `arr[low]` is the correct position for `k`.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The binary search-like operation does not guarantee that the correct position `low` is found, leading to potential incorrect outputs.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
