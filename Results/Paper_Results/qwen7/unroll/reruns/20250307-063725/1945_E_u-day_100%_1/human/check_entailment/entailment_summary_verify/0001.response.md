### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation array such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is supposed to find `x` in the array, and we can make at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_2()**: This function converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - **func_3()**: This function performs the main logic.
     - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
     - It finds the index `pos` of `k` in the permutation array `arr`.
     - It performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly identifies the index `pos` of `k` in the array.
   - The binary search-like operation is implemented to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
   - The code handles the case where `k` is already at the correct position (`low`).
   - The code prints the required number of operations and the positions to swap, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is already at the correct position, no swaps are needed, and the code correctly prints `0`.
   - If `k` is not at the correct position, the code correctly identifies the positions to swap and prints them.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code follows the required format for outputting the number of operations and the positions to swap.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the binary search-like operation. The code uses a set `st` to store mid values, but this is unnecessary and does not affect the outcome of the binary search. More importantly, the binary search-like operation does not guarantee that the correct position `low` will be found. The variable `high` is set to `n`, which is incorrect because the valid range for `m` should be `[0, n-1]`.

Here is a corrected version of the binary search-like operation:

```python
def func_3():
    (n, k) = func_1()
    arr = func_2()
    pos = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == k:
            pos = i
    (low, high) = (0, n - 1)
    while low + 1 < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] > k:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    if arr[low] == k:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
        print(low + 1, pos + 1)
```

With this correction, the binary search-like operation will correctly identify the position `low` where `k` should be placed.

### Conclusion:
The original code has a logical error in the binary search-like operation, which could lead to incorrect results. The corrected version ensures that the binary search operation works correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
