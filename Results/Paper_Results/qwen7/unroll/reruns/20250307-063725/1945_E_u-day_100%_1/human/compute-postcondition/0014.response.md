Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.
- `high` is `n`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`.
- `st` is a set containing all the indices `mid` that were checked during the binary search process.
- `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`.

Given that `arr[low]` is not equal to `k`, it means that `low` must be -1 because if `low` were the index of the first occurrence of `k`, then `arr[low]` would be equal to `k`.

Therefore, both `low` and `pos` are -1 since they are defined similarly in the initial state.

When the print statement `print(low + 1, pos + 1)` is executed, it will print the values of `low + 1` and `pos + 1`.

Since both `low` and `pos` are -1, `low + 1` and `pos + 1` will both be 0.

Output: **0 0**
