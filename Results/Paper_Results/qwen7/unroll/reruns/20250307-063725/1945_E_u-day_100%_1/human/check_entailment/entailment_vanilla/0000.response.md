### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation array such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is supposed to find `x` in the array, and we can make at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_2()**: This function converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - **func_3()**: This function performs the main logic.
     - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
     - It finds the index `pos` of `k` in the permutation array `arr`.
     - It performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The code correctly identifies the index `pos` of `k` in the array.
   - The binary search-like operation is implemented to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
   - The code handles the case where `k` is already at the correct position (`low`).
   - The code prints the required number of operations and the positions to swap, which is correct according to the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is already at the correct position, no swaps are needed, and the code correctly prints `0`.
   - If `k` is not at the correct position, the code correctly identifies the positions to swap and prints them.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code follows the required format for outputting the number of operations and the positions to swap.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
