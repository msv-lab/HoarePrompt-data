Postcondition: `low` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr` or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, and `st` is a set containing all the indices `mid` that were checked during the binary search process. If `arr[low]` is equal to `k`, `low` and `pos` are set to the index of the first occurrence of `k`. Otherwise, `low` and `pos` retain their original values indicating that `k` is not found or the first occurrence of `k` could not be determined.
