Reasoning:
- The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search finds the target value \(x\) at the first position of the resulting permutation.
- The provided code has three functions:
  1. `func_1()` reads two integers \(n\) and \(x\) from the input.
  2. `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers, which is assumed to be the permutation \(p\).
  3. `func_3()` uses these inputs to perform a binary search and potentially swap elements to ensure \(x\) is at the first position.

However, the actual implementation in `func_3()` does not correctly implement the binary search or the necessary swaps to achieve the desired result. Specifically:
- The binary search logic in `func_3()` is flawed because it uses a set to track midpoints, which is unnecessary and incorrect for binary search.
- The logic to find the position of \(x\) in the permutation and perform the required swaps is missing.
- The function does not handle the case where \(x\) is not in the permutation at all, which is a critical part of the problem statement.

Given the provided execution summary and the description of the problem, the current implementation does not meet the requirements of the problem. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
