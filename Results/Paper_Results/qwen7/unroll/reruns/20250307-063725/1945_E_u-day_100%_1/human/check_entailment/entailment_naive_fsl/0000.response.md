Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the binary search algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program uses `func_3` to attempt to find the position of `k` in the permutation `arr`. However, the binary search implementation in `func_3` has a logical error in how it updates the `low` and `high` pointers.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the issue:

1. **Binary Search Logic Error**: The binary search logic in `func_3` does not properly handle the condition where `arr[mid] == k`. The current implementation only checks if `arr[mid] > k` and updates `high` accordingly. This means that if `k` is not found in the first half of the array, the search might incorrectly terminate without checking the second half.

2. **Set Usage**: The use of a set `st` to store mid values is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness of the binary search in this context.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle the case where the element `k` is not present in the array. It only prints 0 if `arr[low] == k`, which is not sufficient because the problem requires rearranging the array using at most 2 swaps to make `p_l == x`.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- **Test Case**: 
  ```
  6 3
  4 3 1 5 2 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**: 
  - After rearranging, the array should be `[3, 4, 1, 5, 2, 6]` or `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` to make `p_l == 3`.
  - The correct swaps would be `(2, 3)` or `(1, 2)`.

- **Actual Output**: 
  - The program will output `0` because it does not find `3` in the array using the incorrect binary search logic.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality and fails to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
