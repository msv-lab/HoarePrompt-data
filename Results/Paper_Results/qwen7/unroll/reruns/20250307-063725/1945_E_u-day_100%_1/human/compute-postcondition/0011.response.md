Based on the initial state provided:

- `low` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.
- `high` is `n`.
- `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`.
- `st` is a set containing all the indices `mid` that were checked during the binary search process.
- The current value of `arr[low]` is equal to `k`.

The `print(0)` statement simply prints the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
