### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation array such that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is supposed to find `x` in the array, and we can make at most 2 swaps to achieve this.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads a line of input and splits it into integers.
   - **func_2()**: This function converts the result of `func_1()` into a list.
   - **func_3()**: This function performs the main logic.
     - It reads the size of the permutation `n` and the target value `k`.
     - It finds the index `pos` of `k` in the permutation array `arr`.
     - It performs a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed.
     - If `arr[low] == k`, it prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
     - Otherwise, it prints `1` and the positions `low + 1` and `pos + 1` to indicate a swap.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Finding `pos`**: The code correctly identifies the index `pos` of `k` in the array using a simple linear scan.
   - **Binary Search-like Operation**: The code attempts to perform a binary search-like operation to find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed. However, the implementation has several issues:
     - The variable `st` is used to store indices, but it is not utilized in the logic.
     - The loop condition `low + 1 < high` is incorrect for a binary search. It should be `low < high`.
     - The `mid` calculation is correct, but the update of `low` and `high` is flawed. The condition `if arr[mid] > k:` should update `high` to `mid`, and `else:` should update `low` to `mid + 1`.
     - Even with the correct loop condition and updates, the binary search might not find the correct position `low` because the array is not sorted, and the binary search is applied to an unsorted array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is already at the correct position, no swaps are needed, and the code correctly prints `0`.
   - If `k` is not at the correct position, the code incorrectly identifies the positions to swap because the binary search-like operation is flawed.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The code follows the required format for outputting the number of operations and the positions to swap, but the positions might be incorrect due to the flawed binary search-like operation.

### Conclusion:
The given Python program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem as described. The binary search-like operation is flawed, and it may not find the correct position `low` where `k` should be placed. Additionally, the positions printed for swaps might be incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
