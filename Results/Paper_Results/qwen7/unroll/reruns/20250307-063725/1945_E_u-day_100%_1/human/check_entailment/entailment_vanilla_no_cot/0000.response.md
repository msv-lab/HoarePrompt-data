Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program attempts to find the position of `k` in the array and then uses binary search to ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x`. However, it does not actually perform the necessary swaps to achieve the desired result. The binary search is performed incorrectly and does not account for the required swaps to place `x` at the start of the array.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Identify the positions of `x` in the array.
2. Perform up to two swaps to move `x` to the start of the array.
3. Ensure the binary search is performed correctly on the sorted segment of the array.

The provided solution does not perform these steps correctly and thus is incorrect.
