The function accepts a positive integer `n`, an integer `k` such that `1 ≤ k ≤ n`, and a list `arr` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to n representing a permutation. It performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`. If `k` is found, it prints `0` and the index of the first occurrence of `k`. If `k` is not found or the first occurrence cannot be determined, it prints `1` and `0 0`. The function returns an integer, either `0` or `1`, based on whether `k` was found or not.
