State: **`pos` is -1, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` must satisfy 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The variable `i` is initialized to 0 in the `range(n)` function, so we need to set `i` to 0.
3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be a positive integer (as given in the problem statement) and `i` should start from 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer.
- `k` must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ k ≤ n.
- `arr` remains as the result of the function `func_2()`.

Thus, the final state is: **`pos` is -1, `n` must be a positive integer, `k` must satisfy 1 ≤ k ≤ n, `arr` is the result of the function `func_2()`, `i` is 0**.
