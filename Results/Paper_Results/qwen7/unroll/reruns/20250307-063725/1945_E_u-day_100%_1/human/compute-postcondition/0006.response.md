Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`**.

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, to 0 and `n` respectively. This does not affect the value of `pos`, which remains as the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`. Therefore, the initial state of `pos` is preserved, and only `low` and `high` are updated.
