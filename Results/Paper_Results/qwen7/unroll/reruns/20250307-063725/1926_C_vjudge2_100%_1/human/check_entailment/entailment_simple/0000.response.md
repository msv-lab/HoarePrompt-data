### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given number `num`.
   - It iterates through each digit of `num`, adding it to `a`, and then updates `num` by removing the last digit using integer division by 10.
   - This process continues until `num` becomes 0.
   - The function returns the computed sum of digits, which is correct.

2. **Precomputed Array `A`**:
   - The array `A` is precomputed to store the cumulative sums of the digit sums from 1 to 200000.
   - This is done in a loop that runs from 1 to 200000, calculating the sum of digits for each number and appending the result to `A`.
   - However, there is a potential issue here: the array `A` is not necessary for solving the problem as we can directly compute the required sum for each test case without storing all intermediate results.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and prints `A[n-1]`.
   - Since `A` is precomputed up to 200000, accessing `A[n-1]` will give the correct sum of digit sums from 1 to `n`.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step takes \(O(n)\) time where \(n = 200000\).
   - Each query is answered in constant time \(O(1)\), making the overall complexity efficient enough to meet the 0.5-second time limit.

### Conclusion:
The program logic is sound and the implementation correctly follows the problem statement. However, the precomputation step is unnecessary and can be optimized by directly computing the sum of digit sums for each test case.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the given constraints.
