Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `num != 0`.
2. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `a` is 0.
   - `num` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `num != 0` must be true. Given that `num` is already a positive integer (which means it is not zero), no adjustment to `num` is necessary.

4. **Conclusion**: Since `num` is already a positive integer, it satisfies the condition `num != 0` without any changes needed.

Therefore, the state right before the loop remains unchanged.

**State: **`a` is 0, `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 2 * 10^5**
