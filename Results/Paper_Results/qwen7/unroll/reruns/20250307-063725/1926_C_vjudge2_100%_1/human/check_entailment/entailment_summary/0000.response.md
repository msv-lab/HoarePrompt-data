Reasoning:
1. The provided program has a fixed list `A` which is precomputed and reused for each test case. This is problematic because it means the program will compute the sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000 only once, regardless of the number of test cases.
2. The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case by printing the corresponding precomputed value from list `A`. However, the precomputed list `A` is not correctly initialized for all values up to 200000.
3. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a given number.
4. The main issue lies in the initialization of the list `A`. Since `A` is not properly populated with the correct sums for all numbers from 1 to 200000, the results for test cases will be incorrect unless the input `n` happens to be within the range of the precomputed values.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it relies on a precomputed list `A` that is not fully populated and thus cannot handle arbitrary values of `n` within the specified range.

Correctness: **False**
