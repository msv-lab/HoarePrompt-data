Reasoning:
1. The annotated program initializes two variables `A` and `sum` but does not use them correctly. Instead of precomputing the sums of digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000, which would be inefficient, it should directly compute the required sum for each test case.
2. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of digits of a given number.
3. The main loop in the program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, reads `n` and prints the result of `A[n-1]`. However, `A` is never used or populated in the given code, making the program incorrect.
4. The correct approach would be to directly compute the sum of the digit sums for each `n` in the test cases without precomputing for all numbers up to 200,000.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary computation for each test case and instead relies on an unpopulated list `A`.

Correctness: **False**
