### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits for each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then finding the cumulative sum of these digit sums.
   - The provided code attempts to precompute the cumulative sums for all integers up to 200,000 and store them in the list `A`.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code initializes an empty list `A` and a variable `sum` to 0.
   - It then iterates from 1 to 200,000, computing the sum of digits for each number using the function `func_1`, adding it to `sum`, and appending `sum` to `A`.
   - After precomputing these values, the code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by printing the corresponding value from `A`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The code precomputes the results for all possible values up to 200,000, which is unnecessary since the input \( n \) can be as large as \( 2 \times 10^5 \).
   - The precomputed values are stored in `A`, but the code does not reset `A` between test cases, leading to incorrect results for subsequent test cases.
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of digits of a number.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Instead of precomputing all values, the code should compute the required sum of digit sums directly for each test case without storing intermediate results.

### Conclusion:
The current implementation is incorrect because it precomputes and stores all results up to 200,000, leading to incorrect outputs for larger values of \( n \). The correct approach would be to compute the sum of digit sums directly for each test case.

**Correctness: False**
