Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Precomputation**: The program precomputes the sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to 200,000 and stores them in the list `A`. This is unnecessary and inefficient because the input can be any value up to 200,000, and we only need to compute the required sum for each test case.

2. **Time Limit Violation**: Given the constraint that the time limit is 0.5 seconds per test case, precomputing the results for all numbers up to 200,000 would exceed the time limit for large values of `t`.

3. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic for computing the digit sum is implemented correctly in `func_1`, but the way the results are stored and retrieved is flawed. The list `A` should not be used in this manner.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(num):
    a = 0
    while num != 0:
        a += num % 10
        num //= 10
    return a

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += func_1(i)
    print(total_sum)
```

This corrected version avoids precomputation and directly computes the required sum for each test case efficiently.
