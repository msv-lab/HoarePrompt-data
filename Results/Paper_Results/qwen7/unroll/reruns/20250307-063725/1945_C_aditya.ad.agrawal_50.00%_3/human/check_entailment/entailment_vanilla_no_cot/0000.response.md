Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization and Calculation of Distances:**
   - The initial distance `dist` is set to `abs(n / 2)`, but it should be initialized to a large value (like `30001`) to ensure any valid position will have a smaller distance initially.
   - The variable `b_d` is used to store the best distance found so far, but it is not correctly updated in the loop. It should be initialized to a large value and updated when a better position is found.

2. **Counting Zeros and Ones:**
   - The counts of zeros (`z_r`) and ones (`o_r`) are updated inside the loop, but they should be updated separately for the left and right sides.
   - The counts of zeros (`z_l`) and ones (`o_l`) are also updated inside the loop, but they should be updated separately for the left and right sides.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The condition `o_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2` and `z_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2` should be checked to ensure that both conditions are met simultaneously.
   - The distance check should be done after both conditions are verified.

4. **Updating the Best Position:**
   - The best position `ans` should be updated only when both conditions are met and the new position has a smaller distance.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        input_string = input()
        arr = [int(ch) for ch in input_string]
        z = arr.count(0)
        o = arr.count(1)
        z_r = z
        o_r = o
        z_l = 0
        o_l = 0
        (dist, ans, pos) = (30001, 0, 0)
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] == 0:
                z_l += 1
                z_r -= 1
            else:
                o_l += 1
                o_r -= 1
            if z_r >= (z_r + o_r) / 2 and o_l >= (z_l + o_l) / 2 and abs(n / 2 - i) < dist:
                ans = i + 1
                dist = abs(n / 2 - i)
        print(ans)
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version initializes the distance correctly, updates the counts properly, checks the conditions correctly, and updates the best position accordingly.
