Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value of `ans` printed for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each value of `t`, the loop processes an input integer `n`, an input string `input_string`, and calculates `arr` from the string. It then determines the counts of zeros (`z`) and ones (`o`) in `arr`. The loop updates the counts of zeros and ones on the left (`z_l`, `o_l`) and right (`z_r`, `o_r`) as it iterates through `arr`. Based on these counts, it calculates `b_d` and `dist`, and finds the position `pos` where the conditions for `ans` are met. Finally, it prints `ans` and decrements `t`. After all iterations, the output state will be a sequence of these `ans` values, one for each iteration of the loop.
