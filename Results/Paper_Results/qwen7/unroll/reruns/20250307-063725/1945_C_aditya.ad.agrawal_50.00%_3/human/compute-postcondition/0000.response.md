Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 20000 (inclusive), and it is the input integer from the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), the updated state reflects that `t` now holds the specific integer input by the user within this range. All other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
