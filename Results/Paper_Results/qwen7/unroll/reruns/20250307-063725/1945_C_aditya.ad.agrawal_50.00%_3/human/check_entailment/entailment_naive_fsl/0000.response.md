Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house. According to the problem description, if the entire village is declared to be either the right or left side, the program should output 0 for the first house. However, the current implementation does not check this condition properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
000
```
The expected output is `0`, but the program will not output `0` because it only checks positions within the array and does not handle the case where the road should be laid before the first house. This is a potential case where the program does not work as expected, hence the correctness is **False**.
