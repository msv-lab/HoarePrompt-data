The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a binary string \( a \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the position \( pos \) in the string where the number of zeros to the left of \( pos \) plus the number of zeros to the right of \( pos \) is at least half the total number of zeros, and the number of ones to the right of \( pos \) is at least half the total number of ones. The function prints the position \( pos \) for each test case and returns a list of these positions.
