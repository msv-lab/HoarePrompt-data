Output State: The output state will be a list of integers, each representing the value of `ans` printed for each iteration of the loop.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the code processes an input string `input_string`, counts the number of 0s and 1s, and then calculates a position `pos` based on certain conditions. The variable `ans` is updated with the position `pos` if certain conditions are met, and this value is printed at the end of each iteration. Since the loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the initial input integer, the final output state will be a list of `t` integers, each corresponding to the `ans` value calculated and printed during each iteration.
