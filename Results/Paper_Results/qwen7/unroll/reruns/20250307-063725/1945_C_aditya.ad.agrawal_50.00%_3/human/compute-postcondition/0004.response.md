Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where t (a positive integer between 1 and 20,000) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n (between 3 and 300,000) and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. It returns a result based on these inputs for each test case.**
