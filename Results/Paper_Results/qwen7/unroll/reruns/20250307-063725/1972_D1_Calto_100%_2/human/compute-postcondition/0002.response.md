Output State: **cnt is -1.**

Explanation: The loop starts with `cnt` initialized to -1. Inside the loop, the values of `x` and `y` are calculated for each iteration, but the value of `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to the current value of `cnt`. However, the values of `x` and `y` do not affect the initial value of `cnt` since they are local to the loop and do not change the initial value of `cnt`. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `cnt` remains -1.
