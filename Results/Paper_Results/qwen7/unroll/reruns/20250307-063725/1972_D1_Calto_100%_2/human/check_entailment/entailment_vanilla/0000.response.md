Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis
#### Function `func_1`
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct and works as expected.

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```

#### Function `func_2`
This function aims to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Let's break down what the function is doing and compare it with the problem requirements.

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Loop Variable `i`**: The loop iterates over values from 1 to \(m\). However, this does not align with the requirement that \(a\) should range from 1 to \(n\).

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)` seems to be an attempt to calculate something related to \(a\), but it is not clear how this relates to the problem.
   - `y = i * i` is simply the square of `i`.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` increments the count based on some conditions involving `x` and `y`. This logic does not match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) within the range \([1, n]\) and check the condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

### Correctness
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
