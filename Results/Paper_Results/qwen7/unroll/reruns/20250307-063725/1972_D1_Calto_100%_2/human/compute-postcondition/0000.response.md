Output State: **`cnt` is -1**

The initial state indicates that `n` and `m` are positive integers within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6. The code snippet initializes `cnt` to -1. No other changes are made to `n` or `m`, so their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is that `cnt` is -1, and `n` and `m` retain their unspecified but positive integer values within the given range.
