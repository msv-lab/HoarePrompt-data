### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_2` iterates over values of `i` from 1 to `m`, which does not cover all possible values of `a` (which should range from 1 to `n`). Additionally, the calculations for `x` and `y` do not align with the problem's requirements.

To further validate this, let's consider the correct approach to solving the problem. We need to iterate over all possible values of `a` from 1 to `n` and for each value of `a`, iterate over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `m` and check if the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

However, the provided function `func_2` does not follow this approach. Instead, it uses a formula that does not correctly account for the gcd condition and the range of `a` and `b`.

Since the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not correctly solve the problem as described.
