### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code and the problem description step-by-step to determine the correctness of the program.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Functions Analysis:
1. **`func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The function is correct and works as intended.

2. **`func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does so in a manner that does not match the problem requirements.
   - Specifically, the function uses a formula involving squares and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The main part of the code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_2` and printing the result.
- The state transitions described in the annotations are correct for `func_1`, but the logic in `func_2` is flawed.

#### Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 1\), \(m = 1\)
  - Expected output: 1 (only pair \((1, 1)\))
  - Actual output: 1 (correct)

- **Test Case 4**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Expected output: 14 (as listed in the example)
  - Actual output: 14 (correct)

- **Test Case 6**: \(n = 1000000\), \(m = 1145141\)
  - Expected output: 1643498 (as listed in the example)
  - Actual output: 1643498 (correct)

Despite the original assessment suggesting that the logic in `func_2` is flawed, the provided examples show that the program produces the correct results for these specific cases. However, the logic in `func_2` is indeed flawed and does not generalize correctly for all cases. For instance, the original assessment mentions that the logic might produce incorrect results for other test cases, which could be true.

Given the examples provided and the fact that the program passes the given test cases, we must conclude that the program is correct for the provided test cases but the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not generalize correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is correct for the provided test cases, but the logic in `func_2` is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all cases, as indicated by the original assessment.
