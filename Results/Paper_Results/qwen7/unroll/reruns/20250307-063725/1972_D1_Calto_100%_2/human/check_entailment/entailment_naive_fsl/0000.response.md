Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- `func_1` is a helper function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is correctly implemented.
- `func_2` attempts to count the valid pairs using a different approach that does not align with the problem statement. It uses a formula involving squares and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem description, the valid pairs are:
  - \((1, 1)\)
  - \((2, 1)\)
  - \((2, 2)\)
  - \((3, 1)\)
  - \((4, 1)\)
  - \((5, 1)\)
  - \((6, 1)\)
  - \((6, 2)\)
  - \((6, 3)\)
  - \((7, 1)\)
  - \((8, 1)\)
  - \((9, 1)\)
  - \((10, 1)\)
  - \((10, 2)\)
  - \((10, 3)\)
  - \((10, 4)\)

This gives us 14 valid pairs, but the program outputs 14, which seems correct for this specific case. However, the logic used in `func_2` is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all cases. For instance, consider \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\):

- The correct output should be 153, but the program might produce an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs according to the problem description.
