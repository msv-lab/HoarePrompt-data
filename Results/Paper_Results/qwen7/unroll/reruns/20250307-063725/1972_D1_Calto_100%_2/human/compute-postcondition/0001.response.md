State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains three variables: `i`, `m`.
2. The loop will start if the condition `1 <= i < m + 1` is true.
3. Initially, `i` is set to 1.
4. For the loop to execute at least once, `m` must be greater than 0 (since `i` starts at 1, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to run).
5. The initial value of `cnt` (-1) does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 1 and `m` being greater than 0.
