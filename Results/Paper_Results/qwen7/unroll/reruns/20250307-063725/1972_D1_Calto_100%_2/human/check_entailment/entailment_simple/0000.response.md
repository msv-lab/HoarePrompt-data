Reasoning:
1. The given program has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
2. `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. This part is correct.
3. However, `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The logic inside `func_2` does not match the conditions specified in the problem statement. Specifically, it calculates something related to squares but does not check whether \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The correct approach to solving this problem involves iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). The current implementation of `func_2` does not do this.

Given the discrepancy between the intended logic and the actual logic implemented in `func_2`, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
