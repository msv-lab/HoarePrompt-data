### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Description:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Provided Code:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Attempts to count the valid pairs but uses a flawed approach.

#### Annotated Code:
- **Function 1**: Correctly computes the GCD.
- **Function 2**: Incorrectly counts the valid pairs. It uses a formula involving squares and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - Correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - This part of the code is correct and can be used to verify the GCD of any two numbers.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The logic used in `func_2` is incorrect. It does not properly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Specifically, the code calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\), and then adds `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` to the counter `cnt`. This approach does not correctly count the valid pairs.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
- **Test Case 1**: \(n = 10\), \(m = 8\)
  - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\), \((3, 1)\), \((4, 1)\), \((5, 1)\), \((6, 1)\), \((6, 2)\), \((6, 3)\), \((7, 1)\), \((8, 1)\), \((9, 1)\), \((10, 1)\), \((10, 2)\), \((10, 3)\), \((10, 4)\)
  - Expected output: 14
  - Actual output: 14 (as per the example, this seems correct for this specific case, but the logic is still flawed)

- **Test Case 2**: \(n = 100\), \(m = 1233\)
  - The correct output should be 153, but the program might produce an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs according to the problem description. The function `func_2` uses an incorrect approach and does not generalize correctly for all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs according to the problem description.
