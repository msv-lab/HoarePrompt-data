Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. This is essential for determining the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Function `func_2` is incorrectly implemented and does not solve the problem as described. Specifically:
  - The logic inside the function does not correctly check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
  - The variables `x` and `y` do not represent any meaningful values related to the problem constraints.
  - The final return value is `-1`, which is clearly incorrect as it does not depend on the input values \(n\) and \(m\).

Given these observations, the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
