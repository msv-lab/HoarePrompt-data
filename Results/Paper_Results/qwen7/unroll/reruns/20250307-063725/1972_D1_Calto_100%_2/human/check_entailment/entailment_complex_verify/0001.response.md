### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's re-evaluate the code and the problem statement to confirm this.

#### Problem Statement Recap
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Function `func_1`
This function correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct and works as expected.

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```

#### Function `func_2`
The function `func_2` attempts to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Here is the detailed breakdown:

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Loop Variable `i`**: The loop iterates over values from 1 to \(m\). However, this does not align with the requirement that \(a\) should range from 1 to \(n\).

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)` seems to be an attempt to calculate something related to \(a\), but it is not clear how this relates to the problem.
   - `y = i * i` is simply the square of `i`.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` increments the count based on some conditions involving `x` and `y`. This logic does not match the problem's requirements.

### Correct Implementation
To correctly solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and for each \(a\), iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\). Then, for each pair \((a, b)\), we need to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is the correct implementation:

```python
from math import gcd

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt
```

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect.
