Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of two numbers. However, it is not used in the main logic of the program, so its correctness is not directly relevant to the overall program correctness.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is supposed to count the number of valid pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. However, the implementation in `func_2` is incorrect. Here's why:
   - The logic inside the loop does not correctly compute the number of valid pairs.
   - The variables `x` and `y` are calculated in a way that does not relate to the problem statement.
   - The update to the counter `cnt` is incorrect and does not reflect the actual count of valid pairs.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs (a, b) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the output hints for `func_2`, it seems the function is not correctly implemented and always returns `-1`, which is clearly incorrect.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
