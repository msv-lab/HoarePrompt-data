The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, as input. It initializes a counter `cnt` to -1. For each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, it calculates values `x` and `y` based on `n` and `i`. It then updates the counter `cnt` by adding the result of `math.ceil(x / y)` plus an additional 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`. Finally, the function returns the counter `cnt`, which is always -1 regardless of the input values.
