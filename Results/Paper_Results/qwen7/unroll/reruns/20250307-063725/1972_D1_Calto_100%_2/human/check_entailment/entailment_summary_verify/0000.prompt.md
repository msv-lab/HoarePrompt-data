You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, as input. It initializes a counter `cnt` to -1. For each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, it calculates values `x` and `y` based on `n` and `i`. It then updates the counter `cnt` by adding the result of `math.ceil(x / y)` plus an additional 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`. Finally, the function returns the counter `cnt`, which is always -1 regardless of the input values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the core requirement of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- `func_1` is a helper function to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is correctly implemented.
- `func_2` attempts to count the valid pairs using a different approach that does not align with the problem statement. It uses a formula involving squares and does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem description, the valid pairs are:
  - \((1, 1)\)
  - \((2, 1)\)
  - \((2, 2)\)
  - \((3, 1)\)
  - \((4, 1)\)
  - \((5, 1)\)
  - \((6, 1)\)
  - \((6, 2)\)
  - \((6, 3)\)
  - \((7, 1)\)
  - \((8, 1)\)
  - \((9, 1)\)
  - \((10, 1)\)
  - \((10, 2)\)
  - \((10, 3)\)
  - \((10, 4)\)

This gives us 14 valid pairs, but the program outputs 14, which seems correct for this specific case. However, the logic used in `func_2` is flawed and does not generalize correctly for all cases. For instance, consider \(n = 100\) and \(m = 1233\):

- The correct output should be 153, but the program might produce an incorrect result due to its flawed logic.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the required logic to count the valid pairs according to the problem description.
