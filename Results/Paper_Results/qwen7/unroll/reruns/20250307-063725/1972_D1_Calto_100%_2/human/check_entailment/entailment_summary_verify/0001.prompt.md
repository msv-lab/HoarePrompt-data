You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, as input. It initializes a counter `cnt` to -1. For each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, it calculates values `x` and `y` based on `n` and `i`. It then updates the counter `cnt` by adding the result of `math.ceil(x / y)` plus an additional 1 if `x` is exactly divisible by `y`. Finally, the function returns the counter `cnt`, which is always -1 regardless of the input values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Given Code Analysis
#### Function `func_1`
This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct and works as expected.

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
```

#### Function `func_2`
This function aims to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem statement. Let's break down what the function is doing and compare it with the problem requirements.

```python
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt
```

### Detailed Analysis
1. **Loop Variable `i`**: The loop iterates over values from 1 to \(m\). However, this does not align with the requirement that \(a\) should range from 1 to \(n\).

2. **Variables `x` and `y`**:
   - `x = n - (i * i - i)` seems to be an attempt to calculate something related to \(a\), but it is not clear how this relates to the problem.
   - `y = i * i` is simply the square of `i`.

3. **Count Calculation**:
   - `cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` increments the count based on some conditions involving `x` and `y`. This logic does not match the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion
The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) within the range \([1, n]\) and check the condition for each pair \((a, b)\).

### Correctness
Given the analysis, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
