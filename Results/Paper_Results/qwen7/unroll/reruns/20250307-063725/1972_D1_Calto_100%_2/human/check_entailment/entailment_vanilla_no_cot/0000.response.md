Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution contains a logical error and does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.

2. **Main Logic**: The `func_2` function is intended to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not achieve this goal. Instead, it appears to be attempting to calculate something related to quadratic residues, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem correctly, you should iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges and check if the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` is satisfied. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

# Function to calculate GCD
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Main function to count valid pairs
def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This code iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` and checks the condition directly, ensuring the correctness of the solution.
