### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the problem as stated. Let's re-evaluate the problem and the given code to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Restatement
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\) and \(1 \le b \le m\).
2. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Code Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - Correct implementation: 
     ```python
     def func_1(a, b):
         while b:
             a, b = b, a % b
         return a
     ```

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function attempts to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) but uses incorrect logic.
   - The loop iterates over values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\), but it does not iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
   - The variables `x` and `y` do not represent the necessary components to check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The count calculation does not correctly reflect the problem's requirements.

#### Correct Implementation
To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
2. For each \(a\), iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of valid pairs.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

# Main program
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)
```

### Final Evaluation
The original code does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect logic in `func_2`. The corrected version iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition properly.

**Final: False**

The original assessment was accurate.
