Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the phone's charge might drop to zero during the process of sending messages. Specifically, the program does not account for the possibility that turning off and on the phone might lead to the charge dropping to zero before the next message can be sent.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
3 10 1 5
1 5 10
```
- Expected Output:
```
NO
```
- Actual Output:
```
YES
```

In this case, the phone starts with 10 units of charge. The first message is sent at moment 1, which consumes \(1 \times 1 = 1\) unit of charge, leaving 9 units. The second message is sent at moment 5, which consumes \(4 \times 1 = 4\) units of charge, leaving 5 units. If we turn off the phone at moment 5 and turn it on at moment 6, the charge will drop by 5 units, making it 0. Since the next message is at moment 10, the phone will not have enough charge to send the message at moment 10.

The program does not account for this scenario, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
