Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message times `ls` and prepends `0` to it.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the list of message times starting from index 1.
   - For each message, it calculates the minimum cost between:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: the cost of keeping the phone on from `ls[i-1]` to `ls[i]`.
     - `b`: the cost of turning off and on the phone.
   - It updates the remaining charge `f` accordingly.
   - After processing all messages, it checks if `f` is greater than 0. If yes, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the phone might run out of charge before sending all messages.
   - The logic for turning off and on the phone is correctly implemented to minimize charge usage.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that the charge calculation is done correctly and efficiently.
   - There is no explicit check for overflow, but since the problem constraints are relatively small (`10^9`), integer overflow is unlikely to occur.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. The program processes each test case as described and handles the necessary calculations accurately.

### Final Answer
