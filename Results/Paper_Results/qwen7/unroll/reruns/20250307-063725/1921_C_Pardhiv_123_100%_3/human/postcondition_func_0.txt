The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n, f, a, b, and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}). For each test case, it calculates the value of f after iterating through the list and subtracting the minimum cost at each step. If f remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to the result of processing one test case.
