Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical error in how it calculates the remaining charge after sending messages. Specifically, the program subtracts the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` and `b` from the current charge `f`. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't correctly account for the scenario where turning off and on the phone might be more beneficial than just letting the phone run continuously.

To fix this, we should consider two scenarios for each interval between messages:
1. Running the phone continuously.
2. Turning off and on the phone at the start of each interval.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        prev_time = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Calculate the charge used if the phone runs continuously
            continuous_charge_used = a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])
            
            # Calculate the charge used if the phone is turned off and on
            turn_off_on_charge_used = b + a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1] - 1)
            
            # Determine which option uses less charge
            charge_used = min(continuous_charge_used, turn_off_on_charge_used)
            
            # Update the remaining charge
            f -= charge_used
            
            # If the charge drops to zero or below, break the loop
            if f <= 0:
                print('NO')
                break
        
        # If the loop completes without breaking, all messages can be sent
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program considers both running the phone continuously and turning it off and on, choosing the option that consumes the least charge for each interval between messages.
