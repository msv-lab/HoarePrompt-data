You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        t -= 1



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. Additionally, m_1, m_2, ..., m_n are integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, each corresponding to whether the value of `f` is greater than 0 after processing each test case.
    #
    #To elaborate, for each iteration of the loop, the program reads in values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list `ls`. It then iterates through the list, updating `f` based on the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`). If `f` remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the initial value provided as input.
    #
    #The final output state is a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, where each string indicates the result of processing one test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n, f, a, b, and a list of n integers m_1, m_2, ..., m_n (1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}). For each test case, it calculates the value of f after iterating through the list and subtracting the minimum cost at each step. If f remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function outputs a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, each corresponding to the result of processing one test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message times `ls` and prepends `0` to it.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the list of message times starting from index 1.
   - For each message, it calculates the minimum cost between:
     - `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`: the cost of keeping the phone on from `ls[i-1]` to `ls[i]`.
     - `b`: the cost of turning off and on the phone.
   - It updates the remaining charge `f` accordingly.
   - After processing all messages, it checks if `f` is greater than 0. If yes, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the phone might run out of charge before sending all messages.
   - The logic for turning off and on the phone is correctly implemented to minimize charge usage.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The program assumes that the charge calculation is done correctly and efficiently.
   - There is no explicit check for overflow, but since the problem constraints are relatively small (`10^9`), integer overflow is unlikely to occur.

### Conclusion

After reviewing the code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if Stepan can send all messages without running out of charge. The program processes each test case as described and handles the necessary calculations accurately.
