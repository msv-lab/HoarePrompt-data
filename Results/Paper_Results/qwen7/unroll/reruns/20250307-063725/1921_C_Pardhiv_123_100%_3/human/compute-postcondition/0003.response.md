Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses, each corresponding to whether the value of `f` is greater than 0 after processing each test case.

To elaborate, for each iteration of the loop, the program reads in values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, followed by a list `ls`. It then iterates through the list, updating `f` based on the minimum cost (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`). If `f` remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process repeats `t` times, with `t` being the initial value provided as input.

The final output state is a sequence of 'YES' or 'NO' strings, where each string indicates the result of processing one test case.
