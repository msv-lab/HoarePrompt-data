Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps to make the element `x` appear at the position `l` where the binary search would place it.
2. The main function reads the input and calls `func_1` to determine the necessary swaps.
3. `func_1` performs a binary search to find the position `m` where `x` should be placed. If `x` is not already at the correct position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
4. The program correctly identifies the need to swap elements to achieve the desired outcome.
5. However, the implementation has a few issues:
   - The variable names `l` and `r` in `func_1` are not consistent with the problem statement. They should be named `l` and `r` as per the problem description.
   - The initial values for `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `n`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. They should be set to `1` and `n+1` respectively.
   - The condition `if l != array.index(find):` checks if the element `x` is not at the correct position, but it should check if `array[l]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The return value from `func_1` is a list of strings, but the program expects a string with space-separated values. This mismatch in expected output format might cause issues if the program is being used in a specific context.

Given these points, the program does not fully adhere to the problem statement and may produce incorrect results due to the inconsistent variable names and incorrect initial conditions for the binary search.

Correctness: **False**
