Reasoning:
1. The problem requires rearranging the permutation using at most two swaps so that the binary search algorithm finds the target value `x`.
2. The provided code only performs one operation to swap the element at the index of the found element with the element at the index of `x` if they are not already in the correct position.
3. The function `func_1` only checks if the element at the found index is equal to `x`. If not, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the found element and `x`.
4. This approach does not cover all possible scenarios where two swaps might be necessary to place `x` in the correct position for the binary search to work.
5. The execution summary does not accurately reflect the logic of the provided code, which only handles the case where one swap is needed and does not account for the possibility of needing two swaps.

Correctness: **False**
