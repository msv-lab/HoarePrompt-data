Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the required solution. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search logic is flawed. The variables `l` and `r` should start with `1` and `n+1` respectively, as per the problem statement. Here, they are initialized to `0` and `n`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function only checks if `array[l]` is equal to `find` and swaps indices if necessary. This approach does not guarantee that the correct element will be moved to the desired position using at most 2 swaps.

3. **Output Format**: The function prints `1` or `0` without returning the correct swap operations as specified in the problem statement.

Here's the corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    
    # Initialize l and r as per the problem statement
    l, r = 1, n + 1
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if array[mid - 1] <= x:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    
    # Find the index of x in the array
    find_index = array.index(x) + 1
    
    # Determine the necessary swaps
    if l != find_index:
        if l - 1 >= 1 and array[l - 2] == x:
            print(1)
            return [str(l), str(find_index)]
        elif l + 1 <= n and array[l] == x:
            print(1)
            return [str(l + 1), str(find_index)]
        else:
            print(2)
            return [str(l), str(find_index), str(l + 1), str(find_index - 1)]
    else:
        print(0)

    t -= 1
```

Given the above corrections, the original program is incorrect because it does not properly implement the binary search and does not handle the required swaps correctly.

Correctness: **False**
