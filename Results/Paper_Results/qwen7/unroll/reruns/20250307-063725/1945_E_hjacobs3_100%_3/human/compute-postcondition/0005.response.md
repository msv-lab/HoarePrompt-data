Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` and `r` define a range such that `array[l]` is the largest value less than or equal to `find`, or `l` will be equal to `n` if no such element exists.
- The current value of `l` is not equal to the index of `find` in the array `array`.

The print statement is simply `print(1)`.

Since the print statement is explicitly printing the number 1, regardless of the values of `l`, `r`, `array`, or `find`, the output will be:

Output: **1**
