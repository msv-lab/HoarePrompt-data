Output State: **`array` is a list of integers representing a permutation of size n, and `n` is the length of `array`.**

Explanation: The code `n = len(array)` calculates the length of the list `array` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state of `array` remains unchanged, and now `n` holds the number of elements in `array`.
