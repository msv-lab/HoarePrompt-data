Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the binary search is not properly used to find the position of `x` in the permutation, and the solution does not ensure that `p_l` is equal to `x` after performing at most 2 swaps. Here's the detailed breakdown:

1. **Binary Search Implementation**: The binary search logic is flawed. The variable `r` is initialized to `n` instead of `n+1`. This means the condition `r - l == 1` will never be met because `r` will always be `n`, and `l` will be less than `n`.

2. **Swapping Logic**: The function `func_1` attempts to swap elements to make `array[l]` equal to `x`, but it does not handle the case where `x` is not present in the array or when the array is already sorted in a way that `x` would be at the correct position without any swaps.

3. **Output Format**: The function returns a list with two strings, but the problem requires printing the number of operations (an integer) followed by the pairs of indices for the swaps. The current implementation does not adhere to this format.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
