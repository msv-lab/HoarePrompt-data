You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

- Program:
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
    res = func_1(array, x)
    if res:
        print(' '.join(res))
    t -= 1

def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if l != array.index(find):
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers (`array`) representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer (`find`) such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`. It searches for the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`. If such an element exists and its index is different from the index of `find`, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of the found element incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` incremented by 1. If no such element exists or if the largest element is `find` itself, it returns a list containing two zeros.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by performing at most two swaps to make the element `x` appear at the position `l` where the binary search would place it.
2. The main function reads the input and calls `func_1` to determine the necessary swaps.
3. `func_1` performs a binary search to find the position `m` where `x` should be placed. If `x` is not already at the correct position, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped.
4. The program correctly identifies the need to swap elements to achieve the desired outcome.
5. However, the implementation has a few issues:
   - The variable names `l` and `r` in `func_1` are not consistent with the problem statement. They should be named `l` and `r` as per the problem description.
   - The initial values for `l` and `r` are set to `0` and `n`, which is incorrect according to the problem statement. They should be set to `1` and `n+1` respectively.
   - The condition `if l != array.index(find):` checks if the element `x` is not at the correct position, but it should check if `array[l]` is not equal to `x`.
   - The return value from `func_1` is a list of strings, but the program expects a string with space-separated values. This mismatch in expected output format might cause issues if the program is being used in a specific context.

Given these points, the program does not fully adhere to the problem statement and may produce incorrect results due to the inconsistent variable names and incorrect initial conditions for the binary search.
