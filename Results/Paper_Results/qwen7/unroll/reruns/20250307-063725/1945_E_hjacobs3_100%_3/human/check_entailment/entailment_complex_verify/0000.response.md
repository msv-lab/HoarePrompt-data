### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to rearrange the permutation such that after performing a binary search, the element `x` is found at position `l`.
- The binary search should be performed on a sorted version of the permutation, but since the permutation is not sorted, we can perform at most 2 swaps to make it work.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   while t > 0:
       (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
       array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
       res = func_1(array, x)
       if res:
           print(' '.join(res))
       t -= 1
   ```
   - The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the permutation and the target value `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(array, find):
       n = len(array)
       l, r = 0, n
       while r - l > 1:
           mid = (l + r) // 2
           if array[mid] <= find:
               l = mid
           else:
               r = mid
       if l != array.index(find):
           print(1)
           return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
       else:
           print(0)
   ```

   - The function performs a binary search to find the largest element less than or equal to `find`.
   - If `l` is not the index of `find`, it prints `1` and returns the indices of the two elements that need to be swapped.
   - If `l` is the index of `find`, it prints `0`.

#### Issues with the Current Implementation:
- The binary search logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position `l`.
- The function only checks if `l` is the index of `find` and returns the indices of the elements to be swapped if they are different.
- However, the binary search logic itself does not guarantee that the element `x` is at the correct position `l` after the search.

#### Corrected Approach:
- To ensure that the element `x` is at the correct position `l`, we need to check the final position of `x` after the binary search and perform the necessary swaps.
- We can modify the function to explicitly move `x` to the correct position `l` if it is not already there.

Here is a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    l, r = 0, n
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    if array[l] != find:
        # Find the index of the element to swap
        swap_index = array.index(find)
        # Perform the swap
        array[l], array[swap_index] = array[swap_index], array[l]
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(swap_index + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

With this modification, the function ensures that the element `x` is moved to the correct position `l` after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
Given the analysis and the corrected approach, the original assessment is inaccurate because the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program needs to ensure that the element `x` is moved to the correct position `l` after the binary search, which is not currently guaranteed by the provided implementation.

**Final: False**
