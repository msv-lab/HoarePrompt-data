### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the required functionality.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We are given a permutation of size `n` and a number `x`.
- We need to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the binary search on the permutation results in `p_l == x`.
- The binary search should terminate with `p_l` being equal to `x`.

#### Provided Program Analysis:
1. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   while t > 0:
       (n, x) = map(int, input().split(' '))
       array = [int(v) for v in input().split(' ')]
       res = func_1(array, x)
       if res:
           print(' '.join(res))
       t -= 1
   ```
   - This loop processes each test case.
   - `func_1` is called with the permutation and the target value `x`.
   - If `func_1` returns a result, it prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(array, find):
       n = len(array)
       (l, r) = (0, n)
       while r - l > 1:
           mid = (l + r) // 2
           if array[mid] <= find:
               l = mid
           else:
               r = mid
       if l != array.index(find):
           print(1)
           return [str(l + 1), str(array.index(find) + 1)]
       else:
           print(0)
   ```

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function performs a binary search on the array to find the largest element less than or equal to `find`.
- If such an element exists and its index is different from the index of `find`, it returns the indices of these elements.
- Otherwise, it returns `0`.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search logic in `func_1` is correct. It finds the largest element less than or equal to `find`.
   - However, the function does not ensure that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search.

2. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The function only checks if `l` is different from the index of `find`. If they are different, it prints `1` and returns the indices of `l` and the index of `find`.
   - This logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the element at `l` might already be `x`.

#### Correct Implementation:
- To fix this, we need to ensure that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search.
- If `l` is not the index of `x`, we need to swap the element at `l` with the element at the index of `x`.

Here is the corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(array, find):
    n = len(array)
    (l, r) = (0, n)
    while r - l > 1:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if array[mid] <= find:
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
    # Ensure the element at l is x
    if array[l] != find:
        # Find the index of x
        idx_x = array.index(find)
        # Swap the elements at l and idx_x
        array[l], array[idx_x] = array[idx_x], array[l]
        print(1)
        return [str(l + 1), str(idx_x + 1)]
    else:
        print(0)
```

With this correction, the function ensures that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search.

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality.
- After correcting the function, the program now correctly rearranges the permutation to ensure that the binary search results in `p_l == x`.

**Final: True**
