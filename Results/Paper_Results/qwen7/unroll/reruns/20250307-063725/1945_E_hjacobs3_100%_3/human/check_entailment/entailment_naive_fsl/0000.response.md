Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not ensure that the element `x` is at position `l` after the binary search. The binary search algorithm in `func_1` does not guarantee that the element `x` is found and moved to the correct position. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
6 3
4 3 1 5 2 6
```

The program will perform a binary search on the array `[4, 3, 1, 5, 2, 6]` to find the value `3`. However, the binary search logic in `func_1` does not ensure that `3` is moved to the correct position. The output of the program is `0`, which means it does not perform any swaps, but the element `3` is not necessarily at the correct position `l`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the element `x` is swapped into the correct position `l` after the binary search. This can be done by checking the final position of `x` after the binary search and performing the necessary swaps if needed.
