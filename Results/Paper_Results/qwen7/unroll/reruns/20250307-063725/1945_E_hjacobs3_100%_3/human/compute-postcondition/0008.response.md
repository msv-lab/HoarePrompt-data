Based on the initial state provided:

- `l` is defined such that `array[l]` is the largest value less than or equal to `find`, or `l` will be equal to `n` if no such element exists.
- `l` is also explicitly stated to be equal to `array.index(find)`.

Given this information, the `print(0)` statement will simply print the integer `0`.

Output: **0**
