The function accepts a list of integers (`array`) representing a permutation of size `n` and an integer (`find`) such that `1 ≤ find ≤ n`. It searches for the largest element in `array` that is less than or equal to `find`. If such an element exists and its index is different from the index of `find`, it returns a list containing two strings: the first string is the index of the found element incremented by 1, and the second string is the index of `find` incremented by 1. If no such element exists or if the largest element is `find` itself, it returns a list containing two zeros.
