Output State: **The variables `l` and `r` will define a range such that `array[l]` is the largest value less than or equal to `find`, or `l` will be equal to `n` if no such element exists.**

Explanation: The loop performs a binary search on the list `array`. After the loop finishes, `l` will point to the index of the largest element in the array that is less than or equal to `find`, or `l` will be equal to `n` if no such element exists. The variable `r` will always be one position to the right of `l` after the last iteration.
