You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Program:
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    (t,) = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        (n, x, y) = R()
        sx = 0
        l = list(R())
        l.sort()
        l.append(n + l[0])
        val = []
        for i in range(1, x + 1):
            c = l[i] - l[i - 1] - 1
            val.append(c)
        val.sort(key=lambda x: (1 - x & 1, x))
        for i in val:
            c = i // 2
            if y < c:
                sx += y * 2
                break
            sx += i
            y -= c
        cons = x + sx - 2
        print(cons)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, specifically \( \text{cons} = x + \text{sx} - 2 \), where \( \text{sx} \) is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of input integers.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to maximize the number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake by choosing additional vertices. However, the logic in the program does not accurately reflect the geometric constraints of the problem.

Here is a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Triangles**: The program calculates the number of triangles based on the differences between consecutive chosen vertices, but it does not correctly account for the total number of triangles that can be formed. The program uses a sorting and breaking mechanism that does not ensure the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   3
   8 4 2
   1 6 2 5
   ```

   The program's output is `6`, but the correct output should be `5`. This is because with the given vertices, the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is 5, not 6.

3. **Algorithmic Flaw**: The algorithm used in the program does not guarantee the maximum number of triangles. It sorts the differences and tries to maximize the number of triangles by breaking the largest segments first, but this approach does not always yield the optimal solution.

To illustrate the issue, let's consider another example:
```
7 3 1
6 4 3
```

The correct output should be `5` because the maximum number of non-intersecting triangles that can be formed is 5. However, the program incorrectly outputs `6`.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
