Output State: **`t` is the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()`, and `R()` splits the input into integers.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` assigns the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()` to the variable `t`. Since `R()` splits the input into integers, `t` will be one of those integers. The initial conditions that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers remain valid.
