Functionality: **The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), followed by \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, specifically \( \text{cons} = x + \text{sx} - 2 \), where \( \text{sx} \) is derived from the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list of input integers.**
