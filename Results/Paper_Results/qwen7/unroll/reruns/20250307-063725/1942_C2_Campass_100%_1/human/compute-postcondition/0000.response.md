Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `R` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input and splits it into integers. This function does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or the list of vertices. Therefore, the precondition remains the same, and only the definition of the lambda function `R` is updated.
