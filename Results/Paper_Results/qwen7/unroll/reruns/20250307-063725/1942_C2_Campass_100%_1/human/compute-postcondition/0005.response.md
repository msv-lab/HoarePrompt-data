Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes three integers n, x, and y (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x), followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function then returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each defined by three integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers. The function processes these inputs without accepting them as parameters directly but rather through the structure of the input data provided.
