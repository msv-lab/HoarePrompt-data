Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the relevant variables in the loop head**: The loop condition is `t`. Therefore, the only variable we need to consider is `t`.

2. **Determine the current state of `t`**: According to the given state right before the loop, `t` is the first integer returned by the lambda function `R()`, and `R()` splits the input into integers.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop `while t:` will continue as long as `t` is non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`).

4. **Determine the necessary adjustment**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero. Since `t` is the first integer returned by `R()`, and `R()` splits the input into integers, `t` could be any integer. However, for the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is non-zero.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be non-zero**
