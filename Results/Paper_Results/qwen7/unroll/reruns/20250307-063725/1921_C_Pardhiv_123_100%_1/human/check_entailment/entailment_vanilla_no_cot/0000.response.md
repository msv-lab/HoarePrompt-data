Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. Here are the issues:

1. **Charge Calculation**: The program calculates the remaining charge `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i-1])` and `b` from `f`. However, this logic is flawed because it doesn't account for the scenario where turning off and then back on might be more beneficial than just continuing to use the phone.

2. **Turning Off and On**: The program does not explicitly handle the turning off and on of the phone to ensure that the charge never drops to zero. It simply checks if the remaining charge `f` is greater than zero after processing all messages.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not consider edge cases where the charge might drop to zero exactly at the moment of sending a message, even if it could be turned off and on to save charge.

To correctly solve the problem, you should:
- Keep track of the exact moments when the phone needs to be turned off and on.
- Ensure that the phone's charge never drops to zero during the process.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        moments = list(map(int, input().split()))
        moments = [0] + moments  # Add moment 0 to the list
        
        next_turn_off = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            # Calculate the charge needed to send the message at moments[i]
            charge_needed = max(a * (moments[i] - moments[i - 1]), b)
            
            # If the charge is sufficient, continue
            if f >= charge_needed:
                f -= charge_needed
            else:
                # If the charge is insufficient, check if turning off and on helps
                if next_turn_off < moments[i]:
                    f += b
                    next_turn_off = moments[i]
                else:
                    # If turning off and on won't help, break
                    break
        
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
        t -= 1

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the phone's charge is managed correctly and that turning off and on the phone is considered when necessary.
