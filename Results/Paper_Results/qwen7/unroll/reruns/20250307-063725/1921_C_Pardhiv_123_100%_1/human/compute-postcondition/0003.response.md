Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the program reads values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, along with a list `ls`. It then iterates through the list, updating the variable `f` by subtracting the minimum of two values (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`). If `f` remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing each test case, `t` is decremented. The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses corresponding to each test case processed within the loop.
