Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. Other variables and the list `m` remain unchanged.**

This means that the variable `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4. All other variables and the list `m` remain in their initial state as per the precondition.
