You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Stepan is a very busy person. Today he needs to send n messages at moments
m_1, m_2, \dots m_n (m_i < m_{i + 1} ). Unfortunately, by the moment 0 , his
phone only has f units of charge left. At the moment 0 , the phone is turned
on.

The phone loses a units of charge for each unit of time it is on. Also, at any
moment, Stepan can turn off the phone and turn it on later. This action
consumes b units of energy each time. Consider turning on and off to be
instantaneous, so you can turn it on at moment x and send a message at the
same moment, and vice versa, send a message at moment x and turn off the phone
at the same moment.

If at any point the charge level drops to 0 (becomes \le 0 ), it is impossible
to send a message at that moment.

Since all messages are very important to Stepan, he wants to know if he can
send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. This is followed by the descriptions of the test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains four integers n , f , a , and b (1
\le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le f, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of messages,
the initial phone's charge, the charge consumption per unit of time, and the
consumption when turned off and on sequentially.

The second line of each test case contains n integers m_1, m_2, \dots, m_n (1
\le m_i \le 10^9 , m_i < m_{i + 1} ) — the moments at which messages need to
be sent.

It is guaranteed that in a test the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if Stepan can send all the messages, and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 3 .
When sending a message at moment 3 without turning it off, (3 - 0) \cdot 1 = 3
units of charge will be spent. In this case, the charge will drop to 0 and
Stepan will not be able to send the message. When turning off and on, the
phone's charge will decrease by 5 , so it will not be possible to send the
message in this way.

In the third test case of the example, at moment 0 , the phone's charge is 10
. The phone loses 1 unit of charge per unit of time, and when turned off and
on, it loses 2 units of charge. To send all messages, the following actions
can be taken:

  * Turn off the phone at moment 0 and turn it on at moment 1 , after which 10 - 2 = 8 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 1 ; 
  * send a message at moment 2 , after which 8 - (2 - 1) \cdot 1 = 7 units of charge will remain; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 2 and turn it on at moment 3 , after which 7 - 2 = 5 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 3 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 3 and turn it on at moment 4 , after which 5 - 2 = 3 units of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 4 ; 
  * Turn off the phone at moment 4 and turn it on at moment 5 , after which 3 - 2 = 1 unit of charge will remain; 
  * send a message at moment 5 . 

The last (sixth) test set of the example may fail if there is an integer
overflow in your solution.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    while t > 0:
        (n, f, a, b) = map(int, input('').split(' '))
        ls = [0] + list(map(int, input('').split(' ')))
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)
        if f > 0:
            print('YES')
        else:

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided.
    #
    #Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the program reads values for `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`, along with a list `ls`. It then iterates through the list, updating the variable `f` by subtracting the minimum of two values (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b`). If `f` remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". After processing each test case, `t` is decremented. The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses corresponding to each test case processed within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), \( b \), and a list of \( n \) integers sorted in ascending order. For each test case, it updates the value of \( f \) by subtracting the minimum of \( a \times (\text{current element} - \text{previous element}) \) or \( b \) from \( f \). If \( f \) remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases, where \( t \) is an integer between 1 and \( 10^4 \). The function does not return any value but prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case using a while loop.

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - It initializes `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` from the input.
   - It creates a list `ls` with an extra leading zero and then fills it with the given message times.

3. **Charge Calculation**:
   - For each message, it calculates the minimum charge required to either send the message directly or turn off and on the phone.
   - The formula used is `f = f - min(a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1]), b)`.
     - If the charge loss due to keeping the phone on (`a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])`) is less than or equal to the charge loss due to turning off and on (`b`), the phone will lose `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` units of charge.
     - Otherwise, the phone will lose `b` units of charge.
   - This calculation ensures that the phone's charge is updated correctly for each message.

4. **Final Check**:
   - After processing all messages, it checks if the final charge `f` is greater than 0.
   - If `f > 0`, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

5. **Decrement Test Cases**:
   - It decrements `t` by 1 after processing each test case.

### Edge Cases and Overflow Consideration
- The program handles the edge cases where the charge might drop to zero or below, ensuring that the phone cannot send a message if the charge is insufficient.
- The use of `min` function prevents unnecessary charge loss by choosing the cheaper option between sending directly and turning off/on.
- There is no explicit check for integer overflow, but since the maximum values are within the limits of typical integer types in Python, this should not be a concern.

### Conclusion
Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all messages without the phone's charge dropping to zero or below. The code handles all the specified conditions and constraints appropriately.
