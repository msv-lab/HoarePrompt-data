Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( f \), \( a \), \( b \), and a list of \( n \) integers sorted in ascending order. For each test case, it updates the value of \( f \) by subtracting the minimum of \( a \times (\text{current element} - \text{previous element}) \) or \( b \) from \( f \). If \( f \) remains positive after processing all elements in the list, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". This process is repeated for each of the \( t \) test cases, where \( t \) is an integer between 1 and \( 10^4 \). The function does not return any value but prints "YES" or "NO" for each test case.**
