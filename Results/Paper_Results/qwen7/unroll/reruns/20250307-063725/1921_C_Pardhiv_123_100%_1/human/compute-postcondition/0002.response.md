Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions given within the loop body.

To break it down further:
- For each value of `t`, the loop reads inputs `n`, `f`, `a`, `b` and a list `ls`.
- It then iterates through the list `ls` from index 1 to `n`, updating `f` by subtracting the minimum of `a * (ls[i] - ls[i - 1])` or `b` from `f`.
- After the loop completes for each `t`, it checks if `f` is greater than 0. If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
- This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.

The final output state will be a series of "YES" or "NO" responses, one for each iteration of the loop, depending on whether `f` remains positive after processing all elements in `ls` for each given set of inputs.
