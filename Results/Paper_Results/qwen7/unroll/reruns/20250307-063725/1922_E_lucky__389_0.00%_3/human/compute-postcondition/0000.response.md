Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, and x is the integer inputted by the user.**

The code `x = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, and the condition for `x` is updated to reflect the range of values it can take based on user input.
