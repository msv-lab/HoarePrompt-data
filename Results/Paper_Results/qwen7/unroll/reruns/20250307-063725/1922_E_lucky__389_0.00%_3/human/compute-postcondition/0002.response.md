Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, and `x` is the integer inputted by the user minus 1; `subseq_lens` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `subseq_lens`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `x`, and adds the new information about `subseq_lens` being an empty list.
