Output State: **mx is the maximum value of i found during the loop, subseq_lens is a list containing all values of i found during the loop.**

Explanation: The loop processes the integer `x` by repeatedly finding the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `x + 1`, subtracting the corresponding sequence length from `x`, and recording the length in `subseq_lens`. The process continues until `x` becomes 0. Therefore, `mx` will be the largest `i` found during these operations, and `subseq_lens` will contain all such `i` values encountered.
