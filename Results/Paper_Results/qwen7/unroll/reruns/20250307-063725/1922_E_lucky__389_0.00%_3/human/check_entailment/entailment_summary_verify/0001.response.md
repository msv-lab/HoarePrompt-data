### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a binary representation approach to construct such an array.

2. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - For a given `X`, we need to find a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
   - The idea is to use the binary representation of `X` to determine the lengths of the increasing subsequences.
   - Specifically, the algorithm calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X+1` and subtracts the corresponding value from `X`.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - The loop `while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:` finds the highest power of 2 that fits into `x + 1`.
   - `subseq_lens.append(i)` adds the length of this subsequence to `subseq_lens`.
   - `x -= 2 ** i - 1` adjusts `x` to account for the subsequence added.
   - This process continues until `x` is reduced to zero.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the lengths of the subsequences found.
   - The final array `ansv` is printed, along with its length.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x` is 1, the algorithm correctly outputs an array of length 1 with a single element.
   - When `x` is 2, the algorithm outputs `[0]` as the array, which is correct since it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).

6. **Testing with Examples**:
   - For `X = 2`, the output is `1 0`, which is correct.
   - For `X = 5`, the output is `3 0 1 0`, which is correct.
   - For `X = 13`, the output is `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which is correct.
   - For `X = 37`, the output is `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is correct.

However, upon closer inspection, there are issues with the logic and the construction of the array:

- **Issue with Negative Values**: The function allows negative values in the array, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem specifies that all elements of the array should be in the range `[-10^9; 10^9]`, but the function does not enforce this constraint.
- **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Values**: The function appends `-1` values without clear justification, which might lead to incorrect results for certain `X` values. For instance, when `X = 37`, the output includes `-1` values, which do not contribute to the count of increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function does not strictly adhere to the problem constraints and may produce incorrect results for some inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
