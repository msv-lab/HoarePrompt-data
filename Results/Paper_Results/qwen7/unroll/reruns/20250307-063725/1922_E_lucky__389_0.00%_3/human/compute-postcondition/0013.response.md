Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing all values of `i` found during the loop.
- `ansv` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens)-2`, printed as `0 1 2 ... (len(subseq_lens)-2)` separated by spaces.

The `print()` statement without any arguments will simply print an empty line.

Output: **Output: (an empty line)**
