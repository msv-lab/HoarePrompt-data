Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences, \(X\). The solution uses a mathematical approach to construct such an array by breaking down \(X\) into powers of 2.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes one test case.
   - It reads \(x\) which is \(X-1\).
   - It then iteratively finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \(x+1\) and subtracts it from \(x\), appending the exponent to `subseq_lens`.
   - After processing, `subseq_lens` contains the exponents of the powers of 2 used to represent \(X-1\) in binary form.
   - The array `ansv` is constructed using these exponents, ensuring the required number of increasing subsequences.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly decomposes \(X-1\) into its binary representation, which corresponds to the construction of the array.
   - The array `ansv` is built to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences as per the binary representation.
   - The output format matches the requirements: the length of the array followed by the array elements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - For \(X = 2\), the function correctly outputs `[0]` with length 1.
   - For other values of \(X\), the function constructs the array correctly by following the binary decomposition logic.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
