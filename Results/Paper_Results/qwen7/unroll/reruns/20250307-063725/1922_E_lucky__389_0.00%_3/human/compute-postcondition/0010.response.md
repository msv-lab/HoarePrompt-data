Based on the initial state provided:

- `mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop.
- `subseq_lens` is a list containing all values of `i` found during the loop.
- `ansv` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens) - 2`.

The `print(len(ansv))` statement will print the length of the `ansv` list.

To determine the length of `ansv`, we need to understand the range of values it contains. Since `ansv` is defined as a list containing all integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens) - 2`, the length of `ansv` will be `len(subseq_lens) - 1`.

Therefore, the output will be the length of `subseq_lens` minus one.

Output: **len(subseq_lens) - 1**
