Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `X` is an integer within the range 2 to 10^18. It does not return any value directly but implies processing or performing some operation based on these inputs.**

Given the constraints, the function likely processes or performs some operation involving `t` and `X`, but since no specific operation is mentioned in the output, we focus on the input parameters and their ranges.
