Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18, and x is the integer inputted by the user minus 1.**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000. The variable `x` is decremented by 1, making it one less than its original value, while still being within the range 2 to \(10^{18}\).
