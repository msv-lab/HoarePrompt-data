Reasoning:

1. The goal of the program is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The approach taken in the program is to use a binary representation to construct the array.

2. The program correctly calculates the necessary lengths of the increasing subsequences needed to achieve the target number of increasing subsequences (`X`). This is done using a while loop where it finds the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `X+1` and subtracts the appropriate value from `X`.

3. After determining the necessary lengths, the program constructs the array by appending the required numbers in a way that ensures the exact number of increasing subsequences matches `X`.

4. The construction of the array is done in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`. The logic used to build the array is sound and will produce the correct output for the given constraints.

5. The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when `X` is small enough that no more subsequences can be added, breaking out of the loop appropriately.

Given these points, the program appears to be logically sound and will produce the correct output for the given problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
