Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value of `i` found during the loop; `subseq_lens` is a list containing all values of `i` found during the loop; `ansv` is a list containing all integers from 0 to `len(subseq_lens)-2`.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of `subseq_lens`, appending each element of `subseq_lens` (starting from index 1) to `ansv`. Therefore, `ansv` will contain all elements of `subseq_lens` except the first one. The values of `mx` and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged from their initial states.
