### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a binary representation approach to construct such an array.

2. **Binary Representation Approach**:
   - For a given `X`, we need to find a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences is exactly `X`.
   - The idea is to use the binary representation of `X` to determine the lengths of the increasing subsequences.
   - Specifically, the algorithm calculates the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `X+1` and subtracts the corresponding value from `X`.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - The loop `while 2 ** (i + 1) <= x + 1:` finds the highest power of 2 that fits into `x + 1`.
   - `subseq_lens.append(i)` adds the length of this subsequence to `subseq_lens`.
   - `x -= 2 ** i - 1` adjusts `x` to account for the subsequence added.
   - This process continues until `x` is reduced to zero.

4. **Constructing the Array**:
   - The array `ansv` is constructed by appending the lengths of the subsequences found.
   - The final array `ansv` is printed, along with its length.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `x` is 1, the algorithm correctly outputs an array of length 1 with a single element.
   - When `x` is 2, the algorithm outputs `[0]` as the array, which is correct since it has exactly 2 increasing subsequences (empty and `[0]`).

6. **Testing with Examples**:
   - For `X = 2`, the output is `1 0`, which is correct.
   - For `X = 5`, the output is `3 0 1 0`, which is correct.
   - For `X = 13`, the output is `5 2 2 3 4 2`, which is correct.
   - For `X = 37`, the output is `7 -1 -1 0 0 2 3 -1`, which is incorrect because the array should have exactly 37 increasing subsequences, but the output does not match the expected count.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The algorithm correctly identifies the lengths of the increasing subsequences using the binary representation of `X`.
- However, the construction of the array `ansv` is flawed. The array `ansv` is filled with integers from `0` to `mx-1`, and then additional elements from `subseq_lens` are appended. This does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
- The issue lies in the way the array is constructed. The algorithm should ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches `X`. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. While it works for some simple cases, it fails for more complex cases like `X = 37`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
