Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subsequence Lengths**: The logic for calculating the lengths of the required subsequence is flawed. The program attempts to use powers of 2 to represent the number of increasing subsequences, but this approach is not sufficient to cover all possible values of `X` within the given constraints.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the array in a way that does not necessarily guarantee the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified. For example, the output for `X = 37` is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 2]`, which does not produce exactly 37 increasing subsequences.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is small or large. For instance, it fails to produce the correct output for certain values of `X`.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated approach, possibly involving combinatorial mathematics or dynamic programming to ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences is achieved.
