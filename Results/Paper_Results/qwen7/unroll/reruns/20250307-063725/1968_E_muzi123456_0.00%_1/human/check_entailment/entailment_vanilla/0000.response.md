Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to place all cells in the first row, starting from the first column up to the \(n\)-th column.
3. Let's analyze the output for different values of \(n\):
   - For \(n = 2\): The output will be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
     The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), and \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - For \(n = 3\): The output will be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
     The Manhattan distances include \(0, 1, 2, 3\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.
   - For larger \(n\), the same pattern continues, ensuring that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is achieved by placing all cells in the first row.

4. While the program does produce outputs that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given examples, it fails to consider other possible configurations that might achieve the same goal. For instance, the optimal configurations mentioned in the problem statement involve distributing cells across multiple rows and columns to maximize the number of distinct distances.

5. Therefore, although the program provides correct outputs for the specific test cases given, it does not guarantee the maximization of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all possible configurations of \(n\).

Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not ensure the maximization of the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all possible configurations of \(n\). It only considers one specific configuration (all cells in the first row), which may not always yield the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.
