Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines. For each iteration where `n` is provided, it will print '1' followed by the number `i` from 1 to `n`, separated by spaces, and then a newline. After processing all provided `n` values, a single space will be printed.

To break it down further:
- If `t` is set to 5 (for example), the loop will run 5 times.
- During each iteration, the user is prompted to enter an integer `n`.
- Then, `n` lines will be printed, each containing '1' followed by numbers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
- After printing these lines for the current `n`, a newline is printed.
- After all iterations, a single space is printed.

For instance, if the user inputs `3`, `2`, and `4` for three consecutive iterations, the output would look like:

```
1 1 
1 1 
1 1 
 1 1 
 1 2 
 1 1 
 1 2 
 1 3 
 1 1 
 1 2 
 1 3 
 1 4 
 
```
