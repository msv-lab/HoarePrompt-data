Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        
        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines where each line starts with a space followed by '1' repeated `n` times, where `n` is an integer input provided during each iteration of the loop. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.
    #
    #To provide a concrete example, if `t` is set to 3 initially:
    #
    #1. For the first iteration (`t = 3`), the user inputs an integer `n`. Let's say `n` is 4. The output will be:
    #   ```
    #     1 1 1 1 
    #   ```
    #
    #2. For the second iteration (`t = 2`), if another `n` is 5, the output will be:
    #   ```
    #     1 1 1 1 1 
    #   ```
    #
    #3. For the third iteration (`t = 1`), if `n` is 3, the output will be:
    #   ```
    #     1 1 1 
    #   ```
    #
    #After all iterations, the final output will look like the concatenation of these lines, each separated by a newline, starting with a space on the first line as per the loop's print statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( t \) and \( n \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \). It then prints \( n \) occurrences of the number 1 on each of \( t \) lines, with each line starting with a space. After processing all test cases, it ends without returning any value.
