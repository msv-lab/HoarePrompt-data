Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The task requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\), which consists of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid. However, the current implementation simply prints cells in a pattern that does not necessarily maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

The program prints a row of cells with the same x-coordinate (1 in this case) but different y-coordinates from 1 to \(n\). This results in a set \(\mathcal{H}\) that only includes the Manhattan distances involving the fixed x-coordinate (which is always 0) and the differences between the y-coordinates, which range from 1 to \(n-1\). Therefore, the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will only contain \(\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}\), which has a size of \(n\). However, this is not necessarily the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \(n = 4\), the program outputs:
```
1 1
1 2
1 3
1 4
```
The set \(\mathcal{H}\) would be \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which indeed has a size of 4. But for larger \(n\), other configurations might achieve a larger set \(\mathcal{H}\).

Given the problem constraints and the need to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), the current implementation does not guarantee the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).

Correctness: **False**
