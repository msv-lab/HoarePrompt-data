You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        n = int(input())

        print(' ')
        
    #State: Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines where each line starts with a space followed by '1' repeated `n` times, where `n` is an integer input provided during each iteration of the loop. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.
    #
    #To provide a concrete example, if `t` is set to 3 initially:
    #
    #1. For the first iteration (`t = 3`), the user inputs an integer `n`. Let's say `n` is 4. The output will be:
    #   ```
    #     1 1 1 1 
    #   ```
    #
    #2. For the second iteration (`t = 2`), if another `n` is 5, the output will be:
    #   ```
    #     1 1 1 1 1 
    #   ```
    #
    #3. For the third iteration (`t = 1`), if `n` is 3, the output will be:
    #   ```
    #     1 1 1 
    #   ```
    #
    #After all iterations, the final output will look like the concatenation of these lines, each separated by a newline, starting with a space on the first line as per the loop's print statement.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program outputs the following coordinates:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |3-1|, |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-2| + |2-1|, |1-2| + |3-1|, |1-3| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |2-1|, |1-3| + |3-1| \} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]

So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include points that achieve all possible Manhattan distances from 0 to \(2(n-1) = 4\), which means \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

A correct approach would involve strategically placing points to ensure the maximum number of distinct distances. The given program does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
