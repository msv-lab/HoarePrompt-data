Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, consider \(n = 3\). The program outputs the following coordinates:

```
1 1
1 2
1 3
```

The set of Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\) for these points is:

\[
\mathcal{H} = \{ |1-1| + |1-1|, |1-1| + |2-1|, |1-1| + |3-1|, |1-2| + |1-1|, |1-2| + |2-1|, |1-2| + |3-1|, |1-3| + |1-1|, |1-3| + |2-1|, |1-3| + |3-1| \} = \{0, 1, 2\}
\]

So, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 3. However, the optimal arrangement for \(n = 3\) should include points that achieve all possible Manhattan distances from 0 to \(2(n-1) = 4\), which means \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).

A correct approach would involve strategically placing points to ensure the maximum number of distinct distances. The given program does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
