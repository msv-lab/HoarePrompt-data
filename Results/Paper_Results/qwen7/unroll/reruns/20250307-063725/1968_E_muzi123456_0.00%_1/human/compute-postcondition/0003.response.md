Output State: The output will consist of multiple lines where each line starts with a space followed by '1' repeated `n` times, where `n` is an integer input provided during each iteration of the loop. This process repeats until `t` becomes 0.

To provide a concrete example, if `t` is set to 3 initially:

1. For the first iteration (`t = 3`), the user inputs an integer `n`. Let's say `n` is 4. The output will be:
   ```
     1 1 1 1 
   ```

2. For the second iteration (`t = 2`), if another `n` is 5, the output will be:
   ```
     1 1 1 1 1 
   ```

3. For the third iteration (`t = 1`), if `n` is 3, the output will be:
   ```
     1 1 1 
   ```

After all iterations, the final output will look like the concatenation of these lines, each separated by a newline, starting with a space on the first line as per the loop's print statement.
