Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 50**.

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, the new value of `t` must still satisfy this condition. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
