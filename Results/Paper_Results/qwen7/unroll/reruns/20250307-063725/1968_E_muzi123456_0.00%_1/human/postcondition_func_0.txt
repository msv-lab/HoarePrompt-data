The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( t \) and \( n \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \). It then prints \( n \) occurrences of the number 1 on each of \( t \) lines, with each line starting with a space. After processing all test cases, it ends without returning any value.
