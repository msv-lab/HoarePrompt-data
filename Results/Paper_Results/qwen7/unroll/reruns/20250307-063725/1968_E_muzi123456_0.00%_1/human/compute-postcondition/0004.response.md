Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 50 and 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, it performs some unspecified operation (not detailed here) and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t and n within specified ranges, and returns a result for each test case without explicitly mentioning the parameters in the function definition.
