Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program prints `n` points of the form `(1, i)` for each test case, which does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances \(\mathcal{H}\).

To maximize \(\mathcal{H}\), the points should be strategically placed across the grid. For example, for \(n = 3\), the optimal arrangement would include points like \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) as shown in the problem statement. The given program does not implement such a strategy and hence will not produce the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n\).
