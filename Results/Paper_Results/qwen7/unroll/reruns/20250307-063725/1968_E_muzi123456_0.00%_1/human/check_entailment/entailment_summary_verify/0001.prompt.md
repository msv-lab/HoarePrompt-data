You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t -= 1
        n = int(input())
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            print('1', end=' ')
            print(i)
        print(' ')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( t \) and \( n \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq t \leq 50 \) and \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^3 \). It then prints \( n \) occurrences of the number 1 on each of \( t \) lines, with each line starting with a space. After processing all test cases, it ends without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program attempts to place all cells in the first row, starting from the first column up to the \(n\)-th column.
3. Let's analyze the output for different values of \(n\):
   - For \(n = 2\): The output will be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     ```
     The Manhattan distances are \(|1-1| + |1-1| = 0\), \(|1-1| + |2-2| = 0\), and \(|1-1| + |1-2| = 1\). Thus, \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 2.
   - For \(n = 3\): The output will be:
     ```
     1 1
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
     The Manhattan distances include \(0, 1, 2, 3\), so \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), and the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) is 4.
   - For larger \(n\), the same pattern continues, ensuring that the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances is achieved by placing all cells in the first row.

4. While the program does produce outputs that maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for the given examples, it fails to consider other possible configurations that might achieve the same goal. For instance, the optimal configurations mentioned in the problem statement involve distributing cells across multiple rows and columns to maximize the number of distinct distances.

5. Therefore, although the program provides correct outputs for the specific test cases given, it does not guarantee the maximization of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all possible configurations of \(n\).

Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not ensure the maximization of the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all possible configurations of \(n\). It only considers one specific configuration (all cells in the first row), which may not always yield the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances.
