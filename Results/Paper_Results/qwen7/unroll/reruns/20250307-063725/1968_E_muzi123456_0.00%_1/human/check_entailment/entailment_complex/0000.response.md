Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The provided program iterates over each test case and prints \(n\) occurrences of the number 1 on each line, which does not correspond to placing cells in the grid to maximize the set \(\mathcal{H}\).
3. The program does not place any cells in the grid according to the problem's requirements. Instead, it simply prints a sequence of 1s, which does not represent any valid configuration of cells in the grid.
4. Given the problem's constraints and the need to maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances, the provided solution does not meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
