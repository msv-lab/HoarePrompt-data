### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - It checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" and removes them one by one until neither substring is found.
   - However, the function only handles the removal of "map" and "pie" individually, but not in combination. For example, if the string contains both "map" and "pie", the function might not remove the minimum number of characters.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: "mmapnapie"
     - The function finds "map" and removes it, then finds "pie" and removes it. This results in 2 deletions, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 2**: "azabazapi"
     - The function finds "api" but does not find "map" or "pie". No deletions are needed, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 3**: "mappppie"
     - The function finds "map" and removes it, then finds "pie" and removes it. This results in 2 deletions, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 4**: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"
     - The function finds "map" repeatedly and removes it each time. This results in 6 deletions, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 5**: "p"
     - The function correctly returns 0 since the string is already beautiful.
   - **Test Case 6**: "pppiepieeee"
     - The function finds "pie" and removes it, then finds another "pie" and removes it. This results in 2 deletions, which is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, if the string is "mappie", the function would remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing "mappie" entirely would result in only 1 deletion, making the solution suboptimal.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. There are edge cases where the function's logic fails to optimize the deletions.

### Correctness:
**False**
