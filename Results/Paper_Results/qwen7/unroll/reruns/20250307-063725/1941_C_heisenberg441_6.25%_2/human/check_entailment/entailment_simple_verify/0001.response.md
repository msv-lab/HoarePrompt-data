### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` currently checks for the substrings "map" and "pie" separately and removes them one by one. This approach ensures that the string becomes free of these substrings, but it may not always result in the minimum number of deletions. For instance, if the string contains both "map" and "pie", the function might remove them sequentially, leading to more deletions than necessary.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Test Case 1**: "mmapnapie"
     - The function finds "map" and removes it, then finds "pie" and removes it. This results in 2 deletions, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 2**: "azabazapi"
     - The function finds "api" but does not find "map" or "pie". No deletions are needed, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 3**: "mappppie"
     - The function finds "map" and removes it, then finds "pie" and removes it. This results in 2 deletions, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 4**: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"
     - The function finds "map" repeatedly and removes it each time. This results in 6 deletions, which is correct.
   - **Test Case 5**: "p"
     - The function correctly returns 0 since the string is already beautiful.
   - **Test Case 6**: "pppiepieeee"
     - The function finds "pie" and removes it, then finds another "pie" and removes it. This results in 2 deletions, which is correct.

3. **Optimization**:
   - The current implementation does not consider the possibility of removing overlapping substrings efficiently. For example, in the string "mappie", the function would remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing "mappie" entirely would result in only 1 deletion, which is optimal.

4. **Correctness**:
   - The function `func_1` does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. It fails to handle overlapping substrings optimally, leading to suboptimal solutions in certain cases.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. There are edge cases where the function's logic fails to optimize the deletions.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle overlapping substrings optimally, leading to suboptimal solutions in certain cases.
