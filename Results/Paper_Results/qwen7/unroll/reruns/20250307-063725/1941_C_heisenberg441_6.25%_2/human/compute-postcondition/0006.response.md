Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `s.find('pie') != -1`. This means the loop will execute as long as the substring 'pie' is found in the string `s`.

2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - The string `s` no longer contains the substring 'map'.
   - `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.

3. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `s` must contain the substring 'pie'. Since `s` currently does not contain 'pie' (because the only information given is about 'map'), we need to adjust the state to ensure `s` contains 'pie'.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - We need to ensure that `s` contains the substring 'pie' for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `s` must contain the substring 'pie'.

**Final Answer**:
State: **The string `s` must contain the substring 'pie' and `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`**
