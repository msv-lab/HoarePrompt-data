Reasoning:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'`. If it is, the function returns `1`, which is incorrect because `'mapie'` should be considered ugly and require at least one removal to be beautiful.
   - The function then iterates over the string `s` to find and remove all occurrences of the substring `"map"` by removing the characters between the indices where `"map"` starts and ends, plus two more characters to skip past the end of `"map"`. This logic is correct.
   - Similarly, it iterates over the string `s` to find and remove all occurrences of the substring `"pie"` by removing the characters between the indices where `"pie"` starts and ends, plus two more characters to skip past the end of `"pie"`. This logic is also correct.
   - Finally, the function returns the total count of deletions required to remove all occurrences of `"map"` and `"pie"`, which is correct.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the string might contain multiple overlapping instances of `"map"` and `"pie"`. It correctly removes them in sequence and counts the deletions accurately.
   - The function also correctly handles the case where the string might initially be empty or already beautiful, returning `0` in such cases.

Given the above analysis, the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The initial check in the function `func_1` for the string `'mapie'` returns `1`, which is incorrect. The string `'mapie'` should be considered ugly and would require at least one deletion to become beautiful. Therefore, the function should return `1` in this case, but it incorrectly returns `0`.

To fix this, the function should be updated to handle the `'mapie'` case correctly:

```python
def func_1(s):
    if s == 'mapie':
        return 1
    ans = 0
    while s.find('map') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('map')] + s[s.find('map') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    while s.find('pie') != -1:
        s = s[:s.find('pie')] + s[s.find('pie') + 2:]
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

With this correction, the function will now correctly handle the `'mapie'` case and the overall logic will be correct.
