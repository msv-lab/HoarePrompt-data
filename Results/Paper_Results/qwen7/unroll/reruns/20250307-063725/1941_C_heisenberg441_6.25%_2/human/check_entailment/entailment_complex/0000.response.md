Reasoning:

The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic**:
   - The function checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'`. If it is, it returns `1`. This is incorrect because the problem requires checking for substrings `"pie"` and `"map"`, not exact matches.
   - The function then uses two while loops to remove all occurrences of `"map"` and `"pie"` from the string `s`. However, the logic for counting the removals is flawed:
     - For `"map"`, it correctly increments `ans` each time it finds and removes `"map"`.
     - For `"pie"`, it also correctly increments `ans` each time it finds and removes `"pie"`.
   - The issue lies in the fact that the function only returns the count of `"pie"` removals, but it should return the total number of characters removed to make the string beautiful.

2. **Incorrect Return Value**:
   - The function should return the total number of characters removed to make the string beautiful, which is the sum of the counts from both while loops.
   - Instead, it only returns the count of `"pie"` removals, which is incorrect.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
