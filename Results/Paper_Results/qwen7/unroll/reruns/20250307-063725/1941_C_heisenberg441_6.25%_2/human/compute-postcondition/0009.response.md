Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, which is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and the length of s (denoted as n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 10^6. The function returns 1 if the substring 'pie' is not found in s. If 'pie' is found in s, the function removes all occurrences of 'pie' and returns the number of times 'pie' was found and removed.**
