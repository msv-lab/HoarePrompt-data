### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to remove the minimum number of characters to make the string `s` beautiful.
   - It iteratively removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" from the string `s` and counts the number of deletions made.
   - However, the function does not handle the removal of overlapping substrings optimally. For instance, in the string "mappie", the function removes "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. But removing "mappie" entirely would result in only 1 deletion, which is the optimal solution.

2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: "mmapnapie"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "map" and "pie", resulting in 2 deletions.
   - **Test Case 2**: "azabazapi"
     - The function correctly identifies that no deletions are needed.
   - **Test Case 3**: "mappppie"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "map" and "pie", resulting in 2 deletions.
   - **Test Case 4**: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "map" repeatedly, resulting in 6 deletions.
   - **Test Case 5**: "p"
     - The function correctly returns 0 since the string is already beautiful.
   - **Test Case 6**: "pppiepieeee"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "pie" twice, resulting in 2 deletions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle overlapping substrings correctly. For example, in the string "mappie", the function would remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing "mappie" entirely would result in only 1 deletion, making the solution suboptimal.

4. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the function removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie" and returns the number of times these substrings were found and removed.
   - However, this summary does not account for the optimal removal of overlapping substrings.

### Conclusion:
The provided function `func_1` does not always remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. There are edge cases where the function's logic fails to optimize the deletions.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
