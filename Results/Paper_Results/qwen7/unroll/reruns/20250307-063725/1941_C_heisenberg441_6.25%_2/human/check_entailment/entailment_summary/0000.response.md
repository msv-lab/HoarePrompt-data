Reasoning:
- The problem requires removing the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.
- The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic to remove the minimum number of characters to eliminate both "pie" and "map" substrings.
- The function only checks for and removes "pie" and does not handle "map".
- The function also incorrectly returns 1 if 'pie' is not found in the string, which is not the correct behavior as per the problem statement.

Given these issues, the provided function does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
