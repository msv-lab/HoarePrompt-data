Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is not correct because it does not handle all cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` only checks for the exact substrings "mapie" and does not properly handle general occurrences of "map" and "pie". Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Substrings:**
   - The function `func_1` should find and remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie", but it only handles "mapie" specifically.
   - It should remove "map" and "pie" regardless of their position in the string.

2. **Incomplete Removal Logic:**
   - The logic inside the function only removes "map" and "pie" when they appear as "mapie", which is not the intended behavior.

3. **Example Test Cases:**
   - For the input `"mmapnapie"`, the expected output is `2`, but the provided code would incorrectly return `1` because it only finds "mapie".
   - For the input `"ppiee"`, the expected output is `0` since it is already beautiful, but the provided code might incorrectly return a non-zero value if it misinterprets the presence of "pie".

To fix this, the function should correctly identify and remove all occurrences of "map" and "pie" without the specific "mapie" check. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    ans = 0
    while 'map' in s:
        s = s.replace('map', '', 1)
        ans += 1
    while 'pie' in s:
        s = s.replace('pie', '', 1)
        ans += 1
    return ans
```

This revised function uses the `replace` method to remove the first occurrence of "map" and "pie" in each iteration until neither substring remains, ensuring that the string is made beautiful with the minimum number of deletions.
