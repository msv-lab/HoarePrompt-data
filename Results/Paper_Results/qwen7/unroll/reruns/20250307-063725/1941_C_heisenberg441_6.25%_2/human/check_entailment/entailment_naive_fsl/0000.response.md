Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` only removes the substrings "map" and "pie" one at a time, but it does not ensure that after removing "map", it does not leave "pie" and vice versa. This can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input string "mappie". According to the problem description, the correct minimum number of deletions required to make this string beautiful is 2 (remove both "map" and "pie"). However, the current implementation would only remove "map" once and then move on to check for "pie", resulting in only one deletion. Therefore, the program does not always produce the minimum number of deletions required to make the string beautiful.
