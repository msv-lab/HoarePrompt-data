### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` step-by-step.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**: The function first checks if the string `s` is exactly `'mapie'`. If it is, it returns 1. This check is unnecessary because the function should handle all cases where `'pie'` or `'map'` appear in the string.
2. **Main Logic**:
   - It initializes `ans` to 0, which will count the number of deletions.
   - It uses two while loops to find and remove all occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'` respectively.
   - For each occurrence found, it removes the substring starting from the found index up to the end of the matched substring (`+2` to skip the matched part).
   - It increments `ans` by 1 for each removal.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- **Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The function correctly handles multiple occurrences of `'map'` and `'pie'` by repeatedly finding and removing them.
- **Order of Removal**: The function removes all occurrences of `'map'` first and then all occurrences of `'pie'`. This ensures that the removal of `'map'` does not leave behind `'pie'` that could have been removed earlier if they were processed together.
- **Edge Cases**:
  - If the string contains both `'map'` and `'pie'`, the function will remove them in the order they are found.
  - If the string contains only one of them, the function will remove that one.
  - If the string does not contain either, the function will return 0.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find and remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1**: `"mappie"`
  - First, it finds and removes `'map'` (resulting in `"pie"`).
  - Then, it finds and removes `'pie'` (resulting in `""`).
  - Total deletions: 2.
- **Example 2**: `"mmapnapie"`
  - First, it finds and removes `'map'` (resulting in `"mnapie"`).
  - Then, it finds and removes `'pie'` (resulting in `"mnap"`).
  - Total deletions: 2.
- **Example 3**: `"azabazapi"`
  - No `'map'` or `'pie'` found.
  - Total deletions: 0.

These examples confirm that the function works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find and remove the minimum number of characters to make the string beautiful. The original assessment was incorrect.

**Final: True**
