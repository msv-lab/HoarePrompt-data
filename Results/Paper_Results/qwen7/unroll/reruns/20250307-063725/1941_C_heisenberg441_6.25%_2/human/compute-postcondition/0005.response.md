Output State: **The string `s` no longer contains the substring 'map', and `ans` is the number of times 'map' was found and removed from `s`.**

Explanation: The loop continues to execute as long as the substring 'map' is found in the string `s`. Each iteration of the loop removes the first occurrence of 'map' from `s` and increments the counter `ans` by 1. Once all occurrences of 'map' are removed, the loop terminates. Therefore, the final state of `s` will be the original string with all instances of 'map' removed, and `ans` will be the total count of how many times 'map' was found and removed.
