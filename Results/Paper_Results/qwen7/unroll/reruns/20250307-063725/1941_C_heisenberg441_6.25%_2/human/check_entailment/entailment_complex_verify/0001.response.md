### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` currently checks for and removes the substrings "map" and "pie" separately using a while loop. This approach ensures that all occurrences of "map" and "pie" are removed, but it does not account for the possibility of removing overlapping substrings in a more optimal manner.
   - For instance, in the string "mappie", the function would remove "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing "mappie" entirely would result in only 1 deletion, which is more efficient.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions of the program. However, it does not address the issue of handling overlapping substrings optimally.
   - The function `func_1` does not consider the possibility of removing overlapping substrings in a single operation, which could lead to suboptimal solutions in certain cases.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: "mmapnapie"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "map" and "pie", resulting in 2 deletions.
   - **Test Case 2**: "azabazapi"
     - The function correctly identifies that no deletions are needed.
   - **Test Case 3**: "mappppie"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "map" and "pie", resulting in 2 deletions.
   - **Test Case 4**: "mapmapmapmapmapmap"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "map" multiple times, resulting in 6 deletions.
   - **Test Case 5**: "p"
     - The function correctly identifies that no deletions are needed.
   - **Test Case 6**: "pppiepieeee"
     - The function correctly identifies and removes "pie" multiple times, resulting in 2 deletions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle overlapping substrings efficiently. For example, in the string "mappie", the function removes "map" and then "pie", resulting in 2 deletions. However, removing "mappie" entirely would result in only 1 deletion, which is more optimal.

### Conclusion:
While the function `func_1` correctly identifies and removes all occurrences of "map" and "pie", it does not handle overlapping substrings in an optimal manner. There are cases where the function's logic results in unnecessary deletions.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
