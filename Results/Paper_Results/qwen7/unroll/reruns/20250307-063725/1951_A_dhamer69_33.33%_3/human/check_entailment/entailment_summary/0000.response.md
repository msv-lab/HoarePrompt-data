Reasoning:
The given program `func()` is designed to process multiple inputs consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` over `t` iterations. Based on the provided execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic specified:

1. If `n` is 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'.
2. If `n` is not 2, it counts the number of '1's in `s`.
3. If the count of '1's is odd, it prints 'NO'.
4. If there is exactly one occurrence of '11', it prints 'NO'.
5. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program does not return any value but outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the specified conditions. There is no indication that the program has any logical errors or mismatches with the described behavior.

Correctness: **True**
