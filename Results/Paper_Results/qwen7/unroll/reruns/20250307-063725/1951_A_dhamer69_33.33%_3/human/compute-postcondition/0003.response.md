Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the program reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s`. Based on these inputs, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. If `n` is 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it checks if the number of '1's in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11'. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' printed during the loop's execution.
