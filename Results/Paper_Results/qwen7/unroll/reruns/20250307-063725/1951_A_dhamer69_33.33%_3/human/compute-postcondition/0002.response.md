Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration where `n` is provided as input.

Explanation: For each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0. During each iteration, the code reads two inputs: `n` and `s`. Based on the value of `n`, different conditions are checked:

- If `n` equals 2 and `s` is '00', it prints 'YES'.
- If `n` is not 2, it checks if the number of '1's in `s` is odd or if there is exactly one occurrence of '11'. If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The final output state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings corresponding to each iteration of the loop, depending on the inputs provided for `n` and `s` during each iteration.
