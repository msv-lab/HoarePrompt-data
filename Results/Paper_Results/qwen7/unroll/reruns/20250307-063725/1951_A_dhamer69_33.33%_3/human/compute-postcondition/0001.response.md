Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `t > 0`.
2. **Current State Before the Loop**: 
   - `start` is an integer.
   - `end` is an integer.
   - `t` is an input integer.

3. **Determine What Needs Adjustment**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t > 0` must be true. Currently, `t` is an input integer, and there is no information about its initial value.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the only variable in the loop condition is `t`, and we need `t > 0` to be true for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` must be greater than 0**
