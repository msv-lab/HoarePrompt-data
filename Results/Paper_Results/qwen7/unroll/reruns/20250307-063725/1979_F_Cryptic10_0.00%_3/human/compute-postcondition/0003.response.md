Output State: **The `path` list contains a sequence of vertices from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, and the `remaining_vertices` set is empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues until there are no more vertices left in `remaining_vertices`. During each iteration, it iterates over the distances in reverse order (from `n-1` to `0`). It calls `func_1(d)` to get two vertices `v` and `u`. If `v` is not 0, it checks if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. If it is, `v` is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loop breaks. This process continues until all vertices are added to `path` and `remaining_vertices` becomes empty.
