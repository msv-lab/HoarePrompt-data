### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices where exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph. The interaction involves querying the degree of vertices and identifying non-connected vertices to iteratively construct the path.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function queries the graph for the vertex with the minimum degree at least \( d \) and a non-connected vertex.
   - It correctly prints the query and reads the response, returning the relevant vertex and non-connected vertex.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the results from `func_1`.
   - It initializes a path list and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iteratively queries the graph starting from the highest degree \( d \) down to 0.
   - For each query, it adds the vertex with the minimum degree to the path and removes it from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The loop continues until all vertices are added to the path.
   - Finally, it prints the constructed path and flushes the output buffer.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that each vertex is added to the path in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.
   - The function correctly handles the removal of vertices and ensures that the path is constructed according to the rules provided.
   - The use of a set to track remaining vertices ensures that each vertex is processed exactly once.
   - The flushing of the output buffer ensures that the program interacts correctly with the judge.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution for finding a Hamiltonian path in the described manner.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
