The function `func_2` accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and returns a sequence of vertices represented as a list of integers. It constructs a path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees, ensuring each selected vertex has the minimum degree that meets the criteria specified by `d`. The function removes selected vertices from a set of remaining vertices until all vertices are processed. Finally, it prints the constructed path and flushes the output buffer.
