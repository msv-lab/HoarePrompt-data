The only variable in the loop head is `remaining_vertices`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_vertices`. For the loop to execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must contain at least one element.

Right before the loop, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing elements from 1 to `n`. To ensure the loop can execute the first time, `remaining_vertices` must not be empty.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `remaining_vertices` is not empty.

State: **`path` is an empty list; `remaining_vertices` must not be empty**
