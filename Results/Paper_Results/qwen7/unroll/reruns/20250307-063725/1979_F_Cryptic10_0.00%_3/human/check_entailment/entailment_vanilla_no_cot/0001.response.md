### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the degree of vertices and get information about the minimum-degree vertex and its non-connected neighbor.
   - We need to achieve this in at most \( n \) queries.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - **Function `func_1(d)`**: This function prints a query and reads the response. It returns the vertex \( v \) and its non-connected neighbor \( u \).
   - **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function constructs a Hamiltonian path.
     - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set of remaining vertices.
     - It iterates over possible degrees \( d \) from \( n - 1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it calls `func_1(d)` to get the vertex \( v \) and its non-connected neighbor \( u \).
     - If \( v \) is in the set of remaining vertices, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set.
     - Once a vertex is added to the path, it breaks out of the loop and moves to the next vertex.

3. **Verification:**
   - The code correctly uses the interactive queries to gather information about the graph structure.
   - It ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
   - The loop iterates up to \( n - 1 \) times, ensuring that all vertices are included in the path.
   - The path is constructed in a way that guarantees a Hamiltonian path exists due to the properties of the graph and the queries.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the case where no suitable vertex \( v \) is found by continuing to the next degree.
   - It ensures that the path construction respects the constraints of the problem.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code logic is sound and adheres to the problem requirements.
   - It correctly constructs a Hamiltonian path using the allowed queries.
