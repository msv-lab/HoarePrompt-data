### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices exist, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the number of vertices with a degree of at least \( d \), and if there are such vertices, we get the vertex with the minimum degree and the minimum-numbered vertex that is not connected to it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function prints a query and reads the response.
   - It correctly handles the input and returns the queried values.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the queries.
   - It initializes a set of remaining vertices and iterates backward from \( d = n - 1 \) to \( d = 0 \).
   - For each degree \( d \), it queries the graph.
     - If a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \) is found and is still in the remaining set, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set.
   - The function then prints the Hamiltonian path.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no vertex with the required degree is found by continuing to the next lower degree.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by removing vertices and their edges, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.

5. **Validation:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement shows how the function works correctly for different scenarios.
   - The function adheres to the constraints of making at most \( n \) queries and handling the responses appropriately.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the problem requirements, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_2`.

### Critical Flaw:
- In `func_2`, the loop iterates backward from \( d = n - 1 \) to \( d = 0 \). This means that the function will try to find a vertex with the highest degree first and then proceed to lower degrees.
- However, the problem requires finding a Hamiltonian path, which means we need to ensure that every vertex is visited exactly once and in a sequence that forms a path.
- The current logic does not guarantee that the path will be a Hamiltonian path. Specifically, the function might remove vertices in a way that disrupts the possibility of forming a Hamiltonian path.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider a graph with 4 vertices where the edges \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), and \((2, 3)\) are removed. The remaining edges form a triangle with vertices \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and \((3, 4)\).

- When \( d = 2 \), the function will find vertex 4 (since it has a degree of 2 and is not connected to any other vertex).
- When \( d = 1 \), the function will find vertex 1 (since it has a degree of 1 and is not connected to any other vertex).
- When \( d = 0 \), the function will find vertex 2 (since it has a degree of 1 and is not connected to any other vertex).

This results in the path \( 4, 1, 2 \), which is not a Hamiltonian path because vertex 3 is missing.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find a Hamiltonian path. The current approach does not guarantee that the path will visit every vertex exactly once and form a Hamiltonian path.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
