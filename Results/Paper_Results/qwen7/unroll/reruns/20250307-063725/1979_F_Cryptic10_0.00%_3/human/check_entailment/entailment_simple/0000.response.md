Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` is used to query the graph and get the vertex `v` with the minimum degree at least `d` and its non-connected vertex `u`.
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph.

2. **Graph Query Handling**:
   - In `func_2`, the program iterates over degrees from `n-1` down to `0` to find a valid vertex `v` and its non-connected vertex `u`.
   - If `v` is found and is still in the `remaining_vertices` set, it is added to the `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`.

3. **Path Construction**:
   - The loop continues until all vertices are removed, ensuring a Hamiltonian path is constructed.
   - The path is then printed in the correct format.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the fact that a Hamiltonian path always exists.
   - It ensures that no more than `n` queries are made for each test case.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format for the Hamiltonian path is correct and matches the problem requirements.

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be sound and should work as intended according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
