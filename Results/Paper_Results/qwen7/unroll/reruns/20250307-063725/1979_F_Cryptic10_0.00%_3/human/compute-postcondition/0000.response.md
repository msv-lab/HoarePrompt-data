Output State: **`path` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `path`. This list does not affect any other variables or their values. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `path` list, which is initially empty. All other variables remain in their initial state, specifically, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, and the function `func_1(d)` remains unchanged.
