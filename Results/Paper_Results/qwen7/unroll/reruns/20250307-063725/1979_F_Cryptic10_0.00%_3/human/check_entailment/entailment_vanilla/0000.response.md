### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices exist, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the number of vertices with a degree of at least \( d \), and if there are such vertices, we get the vertex with the minimum degree and the minimum-numbered vertex that is not connected to it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function prints a query and reads the response.
   - It correctly handles the input and returns the queried values.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the queries.
   - It initializes a set of remaining vertices and iterates backward from \( d = n - 1 \) to \( d = 0 \).
   - For each degree \( d \), it queries the graph.
     - If a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \) is found and is still in the remaining set, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set.
   - The function then prints the Hamiltonian path.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no vertex with the required degree is found by continuing to the next lower degree.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by removing vertices and their edges, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.

5. **Validation:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement shows how the function works correctly for different scenarios.
   - The function adheres to the constraints of making at most \( n \) queries and handling the responses appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries. It handles all necessary edge cases and ensures that the path is constructed within the allowed number of queries.

### Correctness:
**True**
