To determine if the given Python program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step based on the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sends a query to the judge with a specified degree `d`.
   - It expects a response containing two integers: `v` and `u`. 
   - If `v` is `0`, it means no suitable vertex was found, and the loop continues with the next lower degree.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Initializes an empty list `path` to store the Hamiltonian path.
   - Uses a set `remaining_vertices` to keep track of the vertices still in the graph.
   - Iteratively queries the graph starting from the highest degree down to 0.
   - For each degree `d`, it calls `func_1` to get the vertex `v` and its non-adjacent vertex `u`.
   - If `v` is `0`, it skips to the next degree.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the path and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Once all vertices are added to the path, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Degree Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where no suitable vertex is found (`v == 0`) by continuing to the next degree.
   - It ensures that the vertex `v` is added to the path only if it exists in `remaining_vertices`.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program iterates from the highest degree to the lowest, ensuring that it finds a valid vertex at each step.
   - By removing the selected vertex `v` and its adjacent vertex `u` from further consideration, the program maintains the integrity of the remaining graph.

3. **Hamiltonian Path Guarantee**:
   - The problem guarantees that a Hamiltonian path always exists in the given constraints.
   - The program's approach of iteratively selecting vertices ensures that a Hamiltonian path can be constructed.

4. **Query Limit**:
   - The program makes at most `n` queries, which is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the given Python program appears to follow the correct logic to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using the specified queries. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
