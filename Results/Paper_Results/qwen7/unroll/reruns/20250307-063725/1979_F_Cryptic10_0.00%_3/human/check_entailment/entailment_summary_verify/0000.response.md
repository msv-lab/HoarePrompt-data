### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its interaction with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description and Constraints:
- We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph.
- Each query can determine the minimum degree vertex and an adjacent vertex that is not connected to it.
- We can make at most \( n \) queries.
- The graph is non-adaptive, meaning the structure does not change during the interaction.

#### Function Summary:
- `func_2(n)` constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees.
- It uses a set of remaining vertices and a loop to select vertices with the minimum degree that meet the criteria.
- Once a vertex is selected, it is removed from the set of remaining vertices.
- The path is printed and the output buffer is flushed.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Query Strategy**: The program uses the query function `func_1(d)` to get information about the minimum degree vertex and an adjacent vertex that is not connected to it. This strategy is sound because it ensures that we are always selecting the vertex with the minimum degree that meets the criteria.
2. **Path Construction**: The program iterates from \( d = n - 1 \) down to \( d = 0 \). For each \( d \), it queries the graph to find the minimum degree vertex \( v \) and an adjacent vertex \( u \) that is not connected to \( v \). If \( v \) is in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set.
3. **Guaranteed Progress**: Since the graph is non-adaptive and the program always selects the vertex with the minimum degree, it ensures that the path is constructed correctly. The removal of vertices ensures that the path is built in a way that respects the constraints of the problem.
4. **Finite Queries**: The program makes at most \( n \) queries, which is within the allowed limit. Each query provides necessary information to construct the path.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow a sound strategy to construct a Hamiltonian path within the allowed number of queries. The function summary also supports this by stating that the function constructs a path by iteratively selecting vertices based on their degrees, ensuring each selected vertex has the minimum degree that meets the criteria.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly identified the program as incorrect due to potential issues with vertex selection leading to an infinite loop or incorrect path construction. However, the provided program and function summary demonstrate a valid approach to solving the problem within the constraints.

**Final: True**
