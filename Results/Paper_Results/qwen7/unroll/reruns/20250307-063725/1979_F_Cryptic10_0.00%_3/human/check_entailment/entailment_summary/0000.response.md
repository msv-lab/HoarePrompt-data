### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code and the problem statement to determine if the program is correct.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices are given, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the degree of vertices and whether a specific vertex is connected to another vertex.
   - We need to achieve this in at most \( n \) queries.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1(d)`**: This function queries the graph for the vertex with the minimum degree that is at least `d` and returns the vertex and an unconnected vertex.
   - **Function `func_2(n)`**: This function uses `func_1` to construct a Hamiltonian path.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The `func_2` function iteratively selects vertices based on their degrees, ensuring each selected vertex has the minimum degree that meets the criteria.
   - It removes selected vertices from the set of remaining vertices until all vertices are processed.
   - The function prints the constructed path and flushes the output buffer.

4. **Verification**:
   - The approach in `func_2` is sound. By querying the minimum degree vertex and ensuring it is not connected to the last added vertex, we can ensure that the path constructed is a Hamiltonian path.
   - The loop in `func_2` runs in \( O(n) \) time, and each query is made in \( O(1) \) time, fitting within the constraint of \( n \) queries.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the allowed queries.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
