Output State: **The `path` list contains a sequence of vertices from the set {1, 2, ..., n}, and the `remaining_vertices` set is empty.**

Explanation: The code `sys.stdout.flush()` does not affect the values of any variables. It is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that any pending output is written to the console immediately. Since no variables are assigned new values or altered in any way by this line of code, the state of the `path` list and the `remaining_vertices` set remains unchanged.
