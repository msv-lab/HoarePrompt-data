### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices exist, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges are removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the number of vertices with a degree of at least \( d \), and if there are such vertices, we get the vertex with the minimum degree and the minimum-numbered vertex that is not connected to it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function prints a query and reads the response.
   - It correctly handles the input and returns the queried values.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the queries.
   - It initializes a set of remaining vertices and iterates backward from \( d = n - 1 \) to \( d = 0 \).
   - For each degree \( d \), it queries the graph.
     - If a vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \) is found and is still in the remaining set, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes it from the set.
   - The function then prints the Hamiltonian path.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles the case where no vertex with the required degree is found by continuing to the next lower degree.
   - It ensures that the path is constructed by removing vertices and their edges, which is consistent with the problem's constraints.

5. **Validation:**
   - The example provided in the problem statement shows how the function works correctly for different scenarios.
   - The function adheres to the constraints of making at most \( n \) queries and handling the responses appropriately.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_2`. Specifically, the function does not ensure that the selected vertex \( v \) has the minimum degree among those with degree at least \( d \). Instead, it simply selects the first vertex \( v \) with degree at least \( d \) and removes it, which might not necessarily be the vertex with the minimum degree.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider a graph with 4 vertices where the edges \((1, 2)\), \((1, 3)\), and \((2, 3)\) are removed. The resulting graph is a triangle with an isolated vertex (4).

- Querying with \( d = 2 \): The function will return vertex 1 (with degree 2) and vertex 4 (which is not connected to 1).
- Removing vertex 1, the graph becomes a triangle with vertices 2, 3, and 4.
- Querying with \( d = 1 \): The function will return vertex 2 (with degree 1) and vertex 3 (which is not connected to 2).
- Removing vertex 2, the graph becomes a triangle with vertices 3 and 4.
- Querying with \( d = 0 \): The function will return vertex 3 (with degree 0) and vertex 4 (which is not connected to 3).
- Removing vertex 3, the graph is now just vertex 4.

The path constructed is \( 1, 2, 3, 4 \), which is incorrect since the path should be \( 4, 3, 1, 2 \).

### Conclusion:
The function `func_2` does not correctly select the vertex with the minimum degree when multiple vertices have the same degree. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
