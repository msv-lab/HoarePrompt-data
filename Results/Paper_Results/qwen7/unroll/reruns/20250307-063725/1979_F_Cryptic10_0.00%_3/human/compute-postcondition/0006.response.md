Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer between 2 and 10^5 inclusive. It returns a tuple `(v, u)`, where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree that is at least `d` (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and `u` is the vertex that `v` is not connected to (or 0 if no such vertex exists).**
