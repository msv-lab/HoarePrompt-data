Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and for each set, n - 1 lines follow, each containing two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n, representing an edge in the tree. After executing the loop, the values of t, n, k, v, and u remain unchanged, but the function `solve()` has been executed t times.

This means that after all iterations of the loop, the number of test cases (t), the values of n and k for each test case, and the edges of the tree (v and u) remain the same as they were initially, but the `solve()` function has been processed for each of the t test cases.
