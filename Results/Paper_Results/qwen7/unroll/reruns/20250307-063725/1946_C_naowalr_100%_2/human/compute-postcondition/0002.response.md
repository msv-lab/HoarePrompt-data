Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, each set of input data contains two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 10^5, and for each set, n - 1 lines follow, each containing two integers v and u such that 1 ≤ v, u ≤ n, representing an edge in the tree. After executing the loop, the value of t remains unchanged, and for each set of input data, the values of n and k, as well as the edges defined by v and u, remain the same as the initial state.
