Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t, followed by t sets of input data. Each set includes two integers n and k, and n-1 lines representing edges in a tree. The function returns information based on the processed input data.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters directly but rather processes a series of input data. It first takes an integer `t` indicating the number of sets of data to process. For each set, it processes two integers `n` and `k`, and then reads `n-1` lines, each containing two integers `v` and `u`, which represent edges in a tree. Based on this input, the function generates and returns some form of output (though the specific output is not detailed in the given information).
