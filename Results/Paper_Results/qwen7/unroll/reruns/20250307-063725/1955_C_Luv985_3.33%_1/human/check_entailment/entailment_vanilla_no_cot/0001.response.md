### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of ship durabilities `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n-1` to keep track of the first and last indices of the list.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 to count the number of sunk ships.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - Inside the loop, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If `mi * 2 <= k`, it reduces both the first and last ships' durability by `mi` and decreases `k` by `2 * mi`.
   - If either the first or last ship's durability reaches 0, it increments `ans` and adjusts the indices accordingly.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`, it calculates the remaining attacks (`t = k % 2`) and checks if the remaining durability can sink one more ship. If so, it increments `ans`.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - After the main loop, if `l == r`, it checks if the remaining durability `k` can sink the last ship (`ans += k >= a[l]`).

5. **Output**:
   - It prints the total number of sunk ships `ans`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly handles the process of attacking ships from both ends until they sink.
- The program correctly accounts for the reduction in durability and the sinking of ships.
- The edge case where the middle ship remains is handled appropriately.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
