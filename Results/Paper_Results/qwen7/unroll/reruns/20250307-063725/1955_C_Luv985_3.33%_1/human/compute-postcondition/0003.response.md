Output State: The output state will be the sum of the number of elements in the list `a` that become zero after performing the operations described in the inner while loop for each pair of indices `l` and `r`.

Explanation: The code processes each test case (controlled by the outer while loop) where `T` is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, followed by a list `a` of `n` integers. It then iteratively reduces the values in `a` using `k` as the limit, counting how many elements in `a` become zero. After processing all pairs of indices `l` and `r`, it prints the total count of zeros in `a`. The process repeats for each test case until `T` becomes zero.
