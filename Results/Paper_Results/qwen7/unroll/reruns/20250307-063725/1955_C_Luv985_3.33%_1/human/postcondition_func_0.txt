The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( T \), followed by pairs of integers \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) positive integers. For each test case, it iterates through the list \( a \) and reduces the values at the leftmost and rightmost indices using the value of \( k \). It counts the number of elements in the list \( a \) that become zero after these reductions. Finally, it outputs the total count of such reductions across all test cases.
