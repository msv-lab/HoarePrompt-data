You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it receives a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( k \), and a list of \( n \) positive integers representing the durability of ships. The function repeatedly reduces the durability of the ships at the left and right ends of the list by the minimum of their current values until the sum of reductions exceeds \( k \) or one of the ends becomes zero. The function counts the number of times the durability of any ship becomes zero and prints the total count after processing all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of durabilities `a`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The logic uses two pointers `l` and `r` to track the first and last ships.
   - It iterates through the attacks while `l < r` and `k > 0`.
   - In each iteration, it calculates the minimum durability between the first and last ships (`mi = min(a[l], a[r])`).
   - If `mi * 2 <= k`, it reduces both `a[l]` and `a[r]` by `mi`, decreases `k` by `mi * 2`, and checks if either ship has sunk.
   - If `mi * 2 > k`, it handles the remaining attacks with the modulo operation and breaks the loop if necessary.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `l == r`, it checks if the remaining attacks can sink the last ship (`ans += k >= a[l]`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the number of ships sunk after all attacks.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly simulates the process of the Kraken attacking the ships.
- The handling of the remaining attacks when `l == r` is appropriate.
- The use of modulo operations ensures that the remaining attacks are handled correctly.
- The program correctly updates the durability and counts the sunk ships.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
