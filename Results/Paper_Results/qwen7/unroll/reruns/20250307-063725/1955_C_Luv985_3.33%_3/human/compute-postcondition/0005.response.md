Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which indicates the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it receives two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) and a list a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns different outputs based on the values of n, k, and the list a for each sub-case.**

Note: The actual return value or output logic is not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the input parameters and their constraints.
