Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `T`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute at least once, `T` must be non-zero (i.e., `T > 0`).

Given that `T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive, it is already guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

**Conclusion**: Since `T` is already guaranteed to be non-zero based on the given constraints, no additional adjustments are needed.

**Answer**:
State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive**
