Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, while `n`, `k`, and `a` retain their initial states.**

This means that the variable `T` is now set to an integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4. The variables `n`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states as per the precondition.
