Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it receives a positive integer \( n \), another positive integer \( k \), and a list of \( n \) positive integers representing the durability of ships. The function repeatedly reduces the durability of the ships at the left and right ends of the list by the minimum of their current values until the sum of reductions exceeds \( k \) or one of the ends becomes zero. The function counts the number of times the durability of any ship becomes zero and prints the total count after processing all test cases.**
