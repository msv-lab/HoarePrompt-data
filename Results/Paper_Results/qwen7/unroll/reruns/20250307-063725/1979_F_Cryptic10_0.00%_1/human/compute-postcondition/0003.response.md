Output State: **The `path` list contains some or all of the integers from 1 to n, and the `remaining_vertices` set is empty.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as there are vertices in `remaining_vertices`. For each depth `d` (ranging from `n-1` to `0`), it calls `func_1(d)` to get `v` and `u`. If `v` is not 0, it checks if `v` is in `remaining_vertices`. If it is, `v` is added to `path` and removed from `remaining_vertices`, and the loop breaks. This process repeats until `remaining_vertices` is empty. Therefore, the final state will have `path` containing some or all of the integers from 1 to n, and `remaining_vertices` will be empty.
