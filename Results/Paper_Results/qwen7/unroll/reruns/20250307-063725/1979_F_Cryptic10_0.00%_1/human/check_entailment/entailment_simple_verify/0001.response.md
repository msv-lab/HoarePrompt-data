### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices exist, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the number of vertices with a degree of at least \( d \), and if such vertices exist, we get the one with the minimum degree and the number of another vertex not connected to it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function sends a query to the judge and reads the response.
   - It correctly prints the query and flushes the output buffer.
   - It reads the response and returns the vertex \( v \) and the non-connected vertex \( u \).

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices.
   - It iterates over degrees from \( n - 1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it sends a query using `func_1`.
     - If the returned vertex \( v \) is 0, it skips to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - After constructing the path, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

4. **Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the queries and updates the remaining vertices.
   - It ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
   - The path construction logic is sound and should cover all vertices in a Hamiltonian path.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where no vertices with a certain degree are found by continuing to the next degree.
   - It correctly removes vertices from the set of remaining vertices and ensures the path is constructed properly.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before calling `func_2(n)`, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
  - For each test case, `n` is read, and `func_2(n)` is called.

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The annotation correctly describes the state before and after the function call.
  - The function prints the query and reads the response, returning the correct values.

- **Function `func_2`:**
  - The annotation correctly describes the state before and after the function call.
  - The function iterates over degrees from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, sending queries and updating the path and remaining vertices.
  - The logic for adding vertices to the path and removing them from the set is correct.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Path Construction:**
  - The function `func_2` correctly constructs the path by querying the graph for vertices with the minimum degree and ensuring that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
  - The loop iterates over degrees from \( n - 1 \) down to 0, which ensures that the highest degree vertices are considered first, helping to build the path efficiently.
  - The removal of vertices from `remaining_vertices` ensures that the path is constructed without revisiting any vertex.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The function handles the case where no vertices with a certain degree are found by continuing to the next degree.
  - The removal of vertices from `remaining_vertices` ensures that the path is constructed properly and covers all vertices.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries. The function `func_2` correctly handles the queries and updates the remaining vertices, ensuring that the path is constructed properly.

### Final Evaluation:
