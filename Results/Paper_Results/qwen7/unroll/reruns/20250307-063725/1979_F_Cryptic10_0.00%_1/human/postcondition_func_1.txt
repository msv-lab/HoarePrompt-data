The function `func_2(n)` accepts an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5. It processes a set of vertices from 1 to n, removing them one by one based on their degrees using a helper function `func_1(d)`. After processing, it prints a list of the removed vertices in the order they were processed. The function does not return any value.
