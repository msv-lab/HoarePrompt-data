Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph with \( n \) vertices where \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph. We can query the degree of vertices and check connectivity to deduce the structure of the graph.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **`func_1(d)`**: This function queries the graph for a vertex \( v \) with a degree of at least \( d \). If such a vertex exists, it also provides an unconnected vertex \( u \) to \( v \). If no such vertex exists, it returns \( 0 \).
   - **`func_2(n)`**: This function constructs a Hamiltonian path by iteratively querying the graph starting from the highest degree down to 0. It uses `func_1(d)` to find and remove vertices one by one until all vertices are processed.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The algorithm starts by querying the graph for the smallest vertex with a degree of at least \( d \) for decreasing values of \( d \) from \( n-1 \) to 0.
   - When a vertex \( v \) with a degree of at least \( d \) is found, it is added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The process continues until all vertices are processed, ensuring that a Hamiltonian path is constructed.

4. **Verification**:
   - The algorithm correctly identifies and removes vertices based on their degrees and connectivity.
   - The use of `func_1(d)` ensures that the smallest vertex with the required properties is selected, adhering to the problem's constraints.
   - The construction of the Hamiltonian path is systematic and covers all vertices exactly once.

Given the analysis, the provided implementation appears to follow the problem's requirements accurately.
