Output State: **`path` is an empty list, `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet.**

Explanation: The line `path = []` initializes an empty list named `path`. The variable `remaining_vertices` remains unchanged as the code does not modify its value. It still contains integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet.
