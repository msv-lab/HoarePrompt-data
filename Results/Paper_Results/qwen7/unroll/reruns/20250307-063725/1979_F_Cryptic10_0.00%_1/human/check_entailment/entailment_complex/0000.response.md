Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function correctly outputs a query in the required format `? d`.
   - It then reads two integers `v` and `u` from standard input and returns them.
   - The function ensures that the interaction with the judge is done correctly by flushing the output buffer after printing the query.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function initializes an empty list `path` to store the vertices in the Hamiltonian path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to n.
   - It iterates over possible values of `d` from `n-1` down to 0, calling `func_1(d)` to get the vertex `v` with the minimum degree at least `d` and the vertex `u` not connected to `v`.
   - If `v` is 0, it means no suitable vertex was found, and the loop continues.
   - If `v` is in `remaining_vertices`, it is added to the `path`, and `v` is removed from `remaining_vertices`.
   - Once all vertices are processed, the function prints the `path` in the required format `! [element1] [element2] ... [elementN]`.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The main program loops over the number of test cases and calls `func_2(n)` for each test case.
   - Each call to `func_2(n)` ensures that all vertices are processed and a Hamiltonian path is constructed.
   - The logic in `func_2(n)` correctly uses the information provided by `func_1(d)` to construct a Hamiltonian path.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
