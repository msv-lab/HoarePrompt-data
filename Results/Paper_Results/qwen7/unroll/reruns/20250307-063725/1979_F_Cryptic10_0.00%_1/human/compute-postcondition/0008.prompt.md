You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The variable `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet. The function `func_1(d)` is a helper function that returns a tuple (v, u), where v is the vertex with the minimum degree at least d (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and u is the vertex not connected to v (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
def func_2(n):
    path = []
    remaining_vertices = set(range(1, n + 1))
    while remaining_vertices:
        for d in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            v, u = func_1(d)
            if v == 0:
                continue
            if v in remaining_vertices:
                path.append(v)
                remaining_vertices.remove(v)
                break
        
    #State: The `path` list contains some or all of the integers from 1 to n, and the `remaining_vertices` set is empty.
    print(f"! {' '.join(map(str, path))}")
    #This is printed: ! [element1] [element2] ... [elementN]
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. It also uses a helper function `func_1(d)` that returns a tuple (v, u), where v is the vertex with the minimum degree at least d (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and u is the vertex not connected to v (or 0 if no such vertex exists). The function does not return anything explicitly but utilizes the helper function to process the vertices and their degrees.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
