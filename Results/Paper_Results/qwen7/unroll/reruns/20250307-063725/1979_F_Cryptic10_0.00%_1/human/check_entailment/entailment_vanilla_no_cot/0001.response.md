Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1(d)`**:
   - This function prints a query `? d` and waits for the interactor to respond.
   - It returns a tuple `(v, u)` where `v` is the vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and `u` is the vertex that `v` is not connected to (or 0 if none).
   - This function correctly handles the interaction with the interactor and returns the necessary information.

2. **Function `func_2(n)`**:
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path in the graph using at most `n` queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices from 1 to `n`.
   - It enters a loop that continues until all vertices are added to the `path`.
     - For each degree `d` from `n-1` down to 0, it calls `func_1(d)`.
     - If `v` (the returned vertex) is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds `v` to the `path` and removes `v` from `remaining_vertices`.
     - This ensures that we always pick the smallest available vertex with the required properties.
   - Finally, it prints the Hamiltonian path.

### Key Points to Verify:

1. **Query Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles the queries and responses as per the problem statement.
   - It ensures that it does not make more than `n` queries.

2. **Path Construction**:
   - The program constructs the path by always picking the smallest available vertex with the required properties.
   - This approach ensures that the path will pass through each vertex exactly once, forming a Hamiltonian path.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case when `v` is 0 (indicating no suitable vertex is found) by continuing the loop without adding anything to the path.
   - The program correctly removes the selected vertex and all edges connected to it, ensuring the remaining graph is still queried appropriately.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to find a Hamiltonian path using the specified queries. It adheres to the constraints and ensures that the path is constructed properly.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
