The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The function also has access to a set called `remaining_vertices` which contains integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet. The function `func_2` calls a helper function `func_1(d)` which returns a tuple (v, u), where v is the vertex with the minimum degree at least d (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and u is the vertex not connected to v (or 0 if no such vertex exists).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `n`, and utilize a helper function `func_1(d)` to find a vertex with the minimum degree at least `d` and another vertex not connected to it, returning the results in a tuple.
