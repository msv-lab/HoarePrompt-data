### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a Hamiltonian path in a graph where \( n \) vertices exist, and exactly \( n - 2 \) edges have been removed from a complete graph.
   - We can query the number of vertices with a degree of at least \( d \), and if such vertices exist, we get the one with the minimum degree and the number of another vertex not connected to it.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function sends a query to the judge and reads the response.
   - It correctly prints the query and flushes the output buffer.
   - It reads the response and returns the vertex \( v \) and the non-connected vertex \( u \).

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find a Hamiltonian path using the queries.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` to store the path and a set `remaining_vertices` containing all vertices.
   - It iterates over degrees from \( n - 1 \) down to 0.
     - For each degree \( d \), it sends a query using `func_1`.
     - If the returned vertex \( v \) is 0, it skips to the next degree.
     - If \( v \) is in `remaining_vertices`, it adds \( v \) to the path and removes \( v \) from `remaining_vertices`.
   - After constructing the path, it prints the path and flushes the output buffer.

4. **Verification:**
   - The function correctly handles the queries and updates the remaining vertices.
   - It ensures that each vertex is added to the path exactly once.
   - The path construction logic is sound and should cover all vertices in a Hamiltonian path.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function handles the case where no vertices with a certain degree are found by continuing to the next degree.
   - It correctly removes vertices from the set of remaining vertices and ensures the path is constructed properly.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of `func_2`:

- The function assumes that the first vertex with a degree of at least \( d \) will always be the one with the minimum degree and the smallest index if there are ties. This assumption might not hold in all cases.
- The function does not ensure that the selected vertex \( v \) is indeed part of a Hamiltonian path. It simply removes the vertex and continues without checking if the remaining graph still has a Hamiltonian path.

To illustrate, consider the following scenario:
- Suppose the graph is a complete graph minus two edges, and the two removed edges form a triangle. In this case, the function might select a vertex that is not part of a Hamiltonian path, leading to an incorrect path.

Given this, the function does not guarantee that the constructed path is a Hamiltonian path. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not guarantee that the constructed path is a Hamiltonian path, and thus the program is incorrect.

### Final: **False**
