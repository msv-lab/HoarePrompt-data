Output State: **The `path` list contains some or all of the integers from 1 to n, and the `remaining_vertices` set is empty.**

Explanation: The line `sys.stdout.flush()` is used to flush the output buffer, ensuring that all pending buffered data is written to the standard output. However, this line does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the state of the `path` list and the `remaining_vertices` set remains unchanged.
