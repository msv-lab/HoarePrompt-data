To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements of the problem statement. Specifically, we need to ensure that the program can find a Hamiltonian path in the original graph using at most `n` queries.

Let's break down the analysis:

### Key Requirements:
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is a complete undirected graph with `n` vertices from which exactly `(n - 2)` edges have been removed.
2. **Query Type**: The query `"? d "` returns the vertex `v` with the minimum degree at least `d` and the minimum-numbered vertex `u` that is not connected to `v`.
3. **Finding Hamiltonian Path**: The program must find a Hamiltonian path in the original graph using at most `n` queries.

### Analysis of the Given Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sends a query `"? d "` to the judge and reads the response.
   - It correctly handles the case where the response is `"0 0"` by continuing the loop.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to construct a Hamiltonian path.
   - It initializes an empty list `path` and a set of remaining vertices.
   - It iterates over degrees from `n-1` down to `0` to find the minimum-degree vertex `v` and its non-connected neighbor `u`.
   - If `v` is found in the remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The path is then printed as the solution.

### Issues and Improvements:
1. **Degree Calculation**: The approach assumes that the graph is initially complete and only a few edges are missing. However, the code does not explicitly handle the fact that the graph might not be fully connected until the last step.
2. **Path Construction**: The code constructs the path by removing vertices one by one, which might not guarantee finding a Hamiltonian path in the most efficient manner.
3. **Edge Cases**: The code does not handle edge cases where the graph might be disconnected or where the initial graph configuration is not optimal for the given query responses.

### Conclusion:
The given code attempts to solve the problem but does not guarantee correctness due to the lack of handling certain edge cases and the assumption that the graph is fully connected until the last step. Therefore, the program might not always find a Hamiltonian path within the allowed number of queries.

**Correctness: False**
