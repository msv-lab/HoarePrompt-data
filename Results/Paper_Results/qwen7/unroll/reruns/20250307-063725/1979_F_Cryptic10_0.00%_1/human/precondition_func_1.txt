n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The variable `remaining_vertices` is a set containing integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices that have not been removed yet. The function `func_1(d)` is a helper function that returns a tuple (v, u), where v is the vertex with the minimum degree at least d (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and u is the vertex not connected to v (or 0 if no such vertex exists).
