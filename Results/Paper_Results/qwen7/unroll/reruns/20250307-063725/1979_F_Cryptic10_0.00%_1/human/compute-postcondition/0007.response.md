Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. It also uses a helper function `func_1(d)` that returns a tuple (v, u), where v is the vertex with the minimum degree at least d (or 0 if no such vertex exists), and u is the vertex not connected to v (or 0 if no such vertex exists). The function does not return anything explicitly but utilizes the helper function to process the vertices and their degrees.**
