### Reasoning:

1. **Graph Representation and Query Handling**:
   - The problem involves finding a Hamiltonian path in a graph where exactly \(n-2\) edges have been removed from a complete graph with \(n\) vertices.
   - The query function `func_1(d)` correctly outputs the minimum-degree vertex \(v\) with at least degree \(d\) and a non-connected vertex \(u\), or reports 0s if no such vertex exists.
   - The main function `func_2(n)` iteratively uses these queries to construct a Hamiltonian path.

2. **Path Construction Logic**:
   - In `func_2(n)`, the loop runs from \(d = n-1\) down to \(d = 0\). This ensures that the highest-degree vertices are considered first, which helps in maintaining connectivity.
   - For each \(d\), the function calls `func_1(d)` to get the minimum-degree vertex \(v\) and its non-connected neighbor \(u\).
   - If \(v\) is found and is still in the set of remaining vertices, it is added to the path and removed from the set of remaining vertices.
   - The process continues until all vertices are added to the path.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where no suitable vertex \(v\) is found for a particular \(d\) by continuing to the next lower \(d\).
   - The path construction ensures that each vertex is visited exactly once, forming a Hamiltonian path.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The final path is correctly formatted and printed using `sys.stdout.flush()` to ensure immediate output.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic to find and print a Hamiltonian path within the specified constraints.

### Correctness:
**True**

The program is designed to interact correctly with the problem's requirements and constructs a Hamiltonian path as expected.
