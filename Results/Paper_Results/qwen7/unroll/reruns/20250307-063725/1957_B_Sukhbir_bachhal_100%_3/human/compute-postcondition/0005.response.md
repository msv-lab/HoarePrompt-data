Output State: **The value of `position` will be the number of bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`, and `n` will be 0.**

Explanation: The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero. In each iteration, `n` is right-shifted by one bit (`n >>= 1`), which effectively divides `n` by 2 and discards the remainder. The `position` variable is incremented by 1 in each iteration. This process continues until all bits of `n` have been shifted out, meaning `n` becomes 0. At this point, `position` will hold the number of 1-bits in the original binary representation of `n`.
