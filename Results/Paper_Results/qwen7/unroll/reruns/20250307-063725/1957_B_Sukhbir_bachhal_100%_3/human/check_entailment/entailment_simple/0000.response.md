Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Single Element Case**: For `n > 1`, the program attempts to maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence. It does this by setting the first element to `2^counter - 1` (which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit), and the second element to `k - arr[-1]`. This ensures that the first two elements cover as many 1s in their binary representation as possible. The rest of the elements are set to 0 to ensure the sum remains `k`.

3. **Single Element Case Handling**: When `n == 1`, the program simply prints `k`, which is correct since the sum must be `k` and there's only one element.

4. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` calculates the highest power of 2 less than `n` by counting the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus 1. However, there is a logical error in the function:
   - If `n == 0`, it should return 0, not -1. Returning -1 is incorrect because it doesn't align with the logic of finding the highest power of 2 less than `n`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The current implementation handles the edge case when `n == 1` correctly. However, the function `func_1` needs to be fixed to handle the case when `n == 0`.

Given the above points, the program is almost correct but has a logical error in the function `func_1`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, the function `func_1` should be corrected as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 0
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

With this correction, the program should work as intended.
