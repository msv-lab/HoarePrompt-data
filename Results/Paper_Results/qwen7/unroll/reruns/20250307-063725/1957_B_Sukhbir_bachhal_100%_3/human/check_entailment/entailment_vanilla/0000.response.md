Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution uses a loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it splits the input into `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function returns the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - It then constructs an array `arr` with the following elements:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
     - The second element is `k - arr[-1]`, ensuring the sum constraint is met.
     - The remaining elements are zeros.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - For `n > 1`, the constructed array ensures that the bitwise OR of the elements will have the maximum possible number of 1s because `2 ** counter - 1` sets all bits up to the highest bit of `k`, and the remaining elements are zero.
   - The sum of the elements in the array is `k` because the first element is `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, making the total `k`.
   - For `n == 1`, the solution correctly prints `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where `n == 1` by printing `k` directly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the highest bit position of `k` when `k > 0`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly constructs the required sequence for both `n > 1` and `n == 1` scenarios.
   - The logic is sound and meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
