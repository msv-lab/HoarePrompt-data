Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `2^(position-1)` correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1(k)` returns `-1` when `k` is zero, but the program does not account for this scenario properly. When `k` is less than `2^(position-1)`, the program should still produce a valid sequence, but the current implementation will append zeros incorrectly.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
1 1
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program will output `0` because `func_1(1)` returns `-1`, and the logic for appending zeros will be triggered.

To fix this, the program should handle the case where `k` is less than `2^(position-1)` by directly setting the single element in the array to `k` when `n` is 1. Here is a corrected version:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        if k >= 2**(func_1(k)):
            counter = func_1(k)
            arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
            arr.append(k - (2 ** counter - 1))
            for _ in range(n - 2):
                arr.append(0)
        else:
            counter = func_1(k)
            arr.append(k)
            for _ in range(n - 1):
                arr.append(0)
    else:
        arr.append(k)
    print(*arr)

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1
```

This ensures that the program handles all cases correctly.
