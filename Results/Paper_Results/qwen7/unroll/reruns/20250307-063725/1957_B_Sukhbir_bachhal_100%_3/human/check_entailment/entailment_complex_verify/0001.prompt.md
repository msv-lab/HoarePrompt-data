You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program:

        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)
        print(*arr)
    else:
        print(k)

    if n == 0:
        return -1
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        position += 1
    return position - 1

for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    arr = []
    if n > 1:
        counter = func_1(k)
        arr.append(2 ** counter - 1)
        arr.append(k - arr[-1])
        for _ in range(n - 2):
            arr.append(0)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9. Additionally, the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1
    #State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and n is not equal to 0. Additionally, the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.
    position = 0
    while n != 0:
        n >>= 1
        
        position += 1
        
    #State: The value of `position` will be the number of bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n`, and `n` will be 0.
    return position - 1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` as input. If `n` is 0, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` and returns this count minus one. In both cases, the function ultimately returns -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to construct a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k`, and the number of 1s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution uses a loop to handle multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it splits the input into `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it calls `func_1(k)` to determine the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This function returns the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation of `k` minus 1.
   - It then constructs an array `arr` with the following elements:
     - The first element is `2 ** counter - 1`, which is a number with all bits set to 1 up to the highest bit of `k`.
     - The second element is `k - arr[-1]`, ensuring the sum constraint is met.
     - The remaining elements are zeros.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - For `n > 1`, the constructed array ensures that the bitwise OR of the elements will have the maximum possible number of 1s because `2 ** counter - 1` sets all bits up to the highest bit of `k`, and the remaining elements are zero.
   - The sum of the elements in the array is `k` because the first element is `2 ** counter - 1` and the second element is `k - (2 ** counter - 1)`, making the total `k`.
   - For `n == 1`, the solution correctly prints `k`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where `n == 1` by printing `k` directly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly finds the highest bit position of `k` when `k > 0`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution correctly constructs the required sequence for both `n > 1` and `n == 1` scenarios.
   - The logic is sound and meets the problem requirements.
