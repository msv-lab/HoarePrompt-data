Let's analyze the given conditions and the loop statement step by step.

### Given Conditions:
- `position` is 0.
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` and `k` are integers satisfying \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\), respectively.
- `n` is not equal to 0.
- The sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

### Loop Statement:
```
while n != 0:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `n` is not equal to 0.
2. **Initial State**: Before the loop, `n` is not equal to 0 (given explicitly).

Since the loop condition is `n != 0`, and it is already given that `n` is not equal to 0, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

### Conclusion:
No changes are required to the given states because the condition `n != 0` is already satisfied.

### Final Answer:
State: **`position` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, respectively, and `n` is not equal to 0.**
