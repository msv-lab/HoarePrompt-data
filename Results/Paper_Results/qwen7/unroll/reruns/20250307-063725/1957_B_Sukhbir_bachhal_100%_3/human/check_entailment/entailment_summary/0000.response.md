Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to construct a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of the sequence, one effective strategy is to include at least one number with as many 1s as possible in its binary representation. The most straightforward way to do this is to include a number like \( 2^m - 1 \) (which is a number consisting entirely of 1s in binary, e.g., 1, 3, 7, 15, etc.), because it contributes the maximum number of 1s in the OR operation.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly handles the case when \( n = 1 \) by directly printing \( k \).
   - For \( n > 1 \), the program attempts to use the strategy of including one number with many 1s and distributing the remaining sum among the rest of the numbers.
   - The function `func_1` is intended to find the highest bit position set in \( k \), but it incorrectly calculates the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( k \) instead of the position of the highest set bit.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` should return the position of the highest set bit in \( k \). However, it incorrectly returns the count of 1s in the binary representation of \( k \) minus one.
   - This will lead to incorrect results in determining how many 1s to include in the sequence.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - Given the incorrect implementation of `func_1`, the program will not correctly determine the highest bit position to use for constructing the sequence.
   - Therefore, the program will not always produce the optimal solution as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function, which misinterprets the purpose of finding the highest bit position.
