Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns `-1` if `n` is `0`. Otherwise, it calculates the number of bits (1s) in the binary representation of `n` and returns this count minus one.
   - This function correctly identifies the highest bit position set in `n` and returns the position minus one, which is useful for determining the largest possible number with a specific number of bits set to 1.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - If `n > 1`, it calls `func_1(k)` to get the highest bit position `counter` in `k`.
   - It then constructs the array `arr` by appending `2 ** counter - 1` (a number with all bits set to 1 up to the `counter`-th bit), followed by `k - (2 ** counter - 1)` to ensure the sum equals `k`, and then appends zeros to make the total length `n`.
   - If `n == 1`, it simply prints `k`.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where `n == 1` correctly by printing `k`.
   - The logic ensures that the bitwise OR of the constructed array is maximized because `2 ** counter - 1` sets all bits up to the `counter`-th bit, which is the most significant bit in `k`.
   - The sum of the elements in the array is always `k` as required.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The program correctly handles all given constraints and examples.
   - The function `func_1` works as intended to find the highest bit position in `k`.
   - The main logic constructs the array in a way that maximizes the number of 1s in the bitwise OR operation.

Based on the analysis, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
