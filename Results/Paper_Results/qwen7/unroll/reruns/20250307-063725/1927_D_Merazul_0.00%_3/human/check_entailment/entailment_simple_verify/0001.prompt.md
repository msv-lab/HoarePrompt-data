You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: The output will be 'Y' if for every query (l, r), there exists at least one number between indices l and r (inclusive) that is either in set a or set b, and the sum of elements in a and b within the range [l, r] is non-negative. Otherwise, it will be 'N'. The output will also be 'E' if the condition f is true but m or n is negative.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \((-1, -1)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads input but does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - It uses `R` to read multiple integers from input, but this is not used effectively.
   - It initializes variables `t`, `k`, `a`, and `b` but does not use them in a way that addresses the problem requirements.
   - The logic inside the loop is not relevant to the problem and seems to be checking some conditions on sets `a` and `b`, which are not defined according to the problem statement.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - We can use a set to store the elements in the current subarray and check if there are at least two distinct elements.
   - If there are at least two distinct elements, we can return any two indices that correspond to these distinct elements.
   - If there are fewer than two distinct elements, we return \((-1, -1)\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It does not handle the subarrays correctly and does not check for distinct elements within the specified range.
