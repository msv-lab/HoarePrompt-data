### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \((-1, -1)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads input but does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - It uses `R` to read multiple integers from input, but this is not used effectively.
   - It initializes variables `t`, `k`, `a`, and `b` but does not use them in a way that addresses the problem requirements.
   - The logic inside the loop is not relevant to the problem and seems to be checking some conditions on sets `a` and `b`, which are not defined according to the problem statement.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The provided function summary does not match the actual implementation of the given code. The summary talks about sets `a` and `b`, which are not part of the problem statement. The function should be focusing on the subarray from index `l` to `r` and checking for distinct elements.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - We can use a set to store the elements in the current subarray and check if there are at least two distinct elements.
   - If there are at least two distinct elements, we can return any two indices that correspond to these distinct elements.
   - If there are fewer than two distinct elements, we return \((-1, -1)\).

5. **Given Code Evaluation**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It does not handle the subarrays correctly and does not check for distinct elements within the specified range.
   - The code uses `R` to read input but does not process it as required by the problem. The variables `k`, `a`, and `b` are not used appropriately.
   - The logic inside the loop is irrelevant and does not address the problem requirements.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It does not handle the subarrays correctly and does not check for distinct elements within the specified range.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
