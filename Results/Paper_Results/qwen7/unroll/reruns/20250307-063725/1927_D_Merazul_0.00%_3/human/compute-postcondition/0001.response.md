Output State: **`t` is reduced to a single integer from the input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code `t, = R()` takes the input using the lambda function `R()`, which splits the input into a tuple of integers. Since `t` is assigned a single value from this tuple, the other values of `n`, `a`, `q`, and the structure of the queries remain unchanged. The value of `t` is now a single integer, reducing the initial tuple input to just one element.
