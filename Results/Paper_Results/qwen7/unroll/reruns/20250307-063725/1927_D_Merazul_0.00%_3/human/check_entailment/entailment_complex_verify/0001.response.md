### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding pairs of indices \(i\) and \(j\) within a given range \([l, r]\) such that \(a_i \neq a_j\). If no such pair exists, return \((-1, -1)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads input but does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
   - It uses `R` to read multiple integers from input, but this is not used effectively.
   - It initializes variables `t`, `k`, `a`, and `b` but does not use them in a way that addresses the problem requirements.
   - The logic inside the loop is not relevant to the problem and seems to be checking some conditions on sets `a` and `b`, which are not defined according to the problem statement.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - For each query, we need to check the subarray from index `l` to `r`.
   - We can use a set to store the elements in the current subarray and check if there are at least two distinct elements.
   - If there are at least two distinct elements, we can return any two indices that correspond to these distinct elements.
   - If there are fewer than two distinct elements, we return \((-1, -1)\).

4. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code incorrectly states that the function checks if there is at least one number between indices \(l\) and \(r\) that is either in set `a` or set `b`, and verifies if the sum of elements in both sets within the specified range is non-negative. This is not aligned with the problem statement.
   - The function `func()` does not actually process the queries as required. It does not check for distinct elements within the specified range and does not return the correct results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem. It does not handle the subarrays correctly and does not check for distinct elements within the specified range.

### Correctness:
**False**
