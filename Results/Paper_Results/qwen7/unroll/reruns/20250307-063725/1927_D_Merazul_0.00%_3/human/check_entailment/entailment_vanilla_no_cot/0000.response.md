Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here are some issues with the program:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program expects the input in a format that doesn't match the problem description. Specifically, it expects the entire input to be read at once, which is not how the problem is structured. Each test case should be handled separately, and within each test case, the queries should be processed individually.

2. **Logic Errors**: The logic inside the loop does not correctly determine whether there are two different elements within the specified range for each query. The variables `m` and `n` are used incorrectly to count the number of elements in certain sets, but this logic is flawed and does not achieve the intended purpose.

3. **Output Format**: The program attempts to output "YNEOS" which is not a valid output format according to the problem statement. The correct output should be pairs of indices or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def process_queries(n, a, queries):
    result = []
    prefix_diffs = defaultdict(set)
    prefix_diffs[0].add(a[0])
    
    # Compute prefix differences
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_diffs[i] = prefix_diffs[i-1].copy()
        prefix_diffs[i].add(a[i])
    
    for l, r in queries:
        if len(prefix_diffs[r]) > len(prefix_diffs[l-1]):
            # There are different elements in the range [l, r]
            for i in range(l, r+1):
                if a[i] != a[l-1]:
                    result.append((i, l))
                    break
        else:
            result.append((-1, -1))
    return result

def func():
    from io import StringIO
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input()
    lines = data.splitlines()
    
    index = 0
    results = []
    while index < len(lines):
        t = int(lines[index])
        index += 1
        n = int(lines[index])
        a = list(map(int, lines[index+1].split()))
        index += 2
        q = int(lines[index])
        queries = []
        for _ in range(q):
            l, r = map(int, lines[index].split())
            queries.append((l, r))
            index += 1
        
        result = process_queries(n, a, queries)
        results.extend(result)
    
    for res in results:
        print(res[0], res[1])

func()
```

This corrected program properly handles multiple test cases and queries, ensuring that the output matches the problem requirements.
