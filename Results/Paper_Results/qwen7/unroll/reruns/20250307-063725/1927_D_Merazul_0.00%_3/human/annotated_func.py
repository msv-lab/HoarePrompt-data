#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; q is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5; each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func():
    R = lambda : map(int, input().split())
    t, = R()
    while t:
        t -= 1
        
        *_, k = R()
        
        a = {*R()}
        
        b = {*R()}
        
        f = 1
        
        m = n = k // 2
        
        for i in range(1, k + 1):
            u = i in a
            v = i in b
            f &= u | v
            m -= u & ~v
            n -= ~u & v
        
        print('YNEOS'[f ^ 1 or m | n < 0::2])
        
    #State: The output will be 'Y' if for every query (l, r), there exists at least one number between indices l and r (inclusive) that is either in set a or set b, and the sum of elements in a and b within the range [l, r] is non-negative. Otherwise, it will be 'N'. The output will also be 'E' if the condition f is true but m or n is negative.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple queries on a set of numbers. It first reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads additional parameters including the size of sets `k`, and the sets `a` and `b`. For each query defined by the range `[l, r]`, it checks if there is at least one number within this range that is present in either set `a` or set `b`. Additionally, it verifies if the sum of elements in both sets within the specified range is non-negative. If both conditions are met for all queries, it prints 'Y'; otherwise, it prints 'N'. If the condition `f` is true but the counts `m` or `n` are negative, it prints 'E'.
