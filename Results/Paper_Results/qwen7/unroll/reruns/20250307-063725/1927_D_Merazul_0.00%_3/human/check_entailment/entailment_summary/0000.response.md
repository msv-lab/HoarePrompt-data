Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program uses `R = lambda : map(int, input().split())` to read input, but it incorrectly processes the input for each test case. Specifically, it reads the size of the set `k` and then reads two more sets `a` and `b`, which is not aligned with the problem statement. The problem requires reading an array `a` and a number of queries `q`, followed by pairs of integers `l` and `r` for each query.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Queries**: The program attempts to check if there are elements in the range `[1, k]` that are present in either set `a` or set `b`. However, the problem requires checking for distinct elements within the range `[l, r]` of the array `a`, not just any range `[1, k]`.

3. **Incorrect Output**: The program prints 'Y', 'N', or 'E' based on some conditions that do not match the requirements of the problem. It should be printing pairs of indices `i` and `j` that satisfy the conditions or `-1 -1` if no such pair exists.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
