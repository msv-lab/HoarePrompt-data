Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `a` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6; `q` is an integer such that 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n; `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line of input and splits it into integers, converting them to a tuple. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `q`, or the structure of the queries.
