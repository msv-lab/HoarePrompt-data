Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, the program attempts to solve a different problem related to set operations rather than finding pairs of different elements within specified query ranges. For instance, consider the following input:

```
5
5
1 1 2 1 1
3
1 5
1 2
1 3
```

The expected output would be:
```
2 3
-1 -1
1 3
```

However, the provided program will not produce the correct output for this case. It seems to focus on set operations and does not handle the query ranges as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
