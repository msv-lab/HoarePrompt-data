Reasoning:
The provided solution aims to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The approach taken in the `func_1` function is to sort the array and then create a new array by appending elements from the sorted array in reverse order. This ensures that the largest and smallest values are placed at the ends of the sequence, maximizing the differences between consecutive elements.

Let's analyze the steps:

1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting the array helps in arranging the elements in ascending order.
2. **Creating a New Array in Reverse Order**: By creating a new array and appending elements from the sorted array in reverse order, we ensure that the largest and smallest values are adjacent, maximizing their difference.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: The beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach is correct. Hereâ€™s why:

- When the array is sorted and then reversed, the largest and smallest elements are adjacent, leading to the maximum possible difference.
- The sum of these differences will indeed give the maximum beauty of the array.

The code logic matches the problem description and the expected behavior. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
