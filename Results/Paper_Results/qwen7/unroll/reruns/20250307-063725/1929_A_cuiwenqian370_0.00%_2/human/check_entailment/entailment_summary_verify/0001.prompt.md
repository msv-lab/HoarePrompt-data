You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It first sorts the list `arr`, then creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from `arr` in reverse order. After that, it calculates the maximum beauty, defined as the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` starting from index 1 to n-1. Finally, it returns this maximum beauty.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. The provided solution sorts the array and then alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`. This approach aims to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. After constructing `new_arr`, the solution calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
4. Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed next to each other, maximizing their difference.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements, we ensure that the differences are maximized at every step.
   - This approach works because the absolute difference between two numbers is maximized when one is as small as possible and the other is as large as possible.
5. The example cases provided in the problem statement support this approach:
   - For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]` and rearranging as `[1, 3, 2]` results in a beauty of `2`.
   - For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, the beauty remains `0` regardless of the order since all elements are the same.
   - For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting and rearranging as `[43, 100, 54, 80, 90]` results in a beauty of `57`.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting and rearranging the elements as described.
