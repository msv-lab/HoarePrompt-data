The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It first sorts the list `arr`, then creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from `arr` in reverse order. After that, it calculates the maximum beauty, defined as the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` starting from index 1 to n-1. Finally, it returns this maximum beauty.
