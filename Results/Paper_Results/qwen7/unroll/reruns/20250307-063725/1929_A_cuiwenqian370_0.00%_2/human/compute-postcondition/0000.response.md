Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.**

Explanation: The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\) and `arr` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range \(1 \leq arr[i] \leq 10^9\). After sorting, the list `arr` will contain the same integers as before, but they will be arranged in non-decreasing order. All other variables remain unchanged.
