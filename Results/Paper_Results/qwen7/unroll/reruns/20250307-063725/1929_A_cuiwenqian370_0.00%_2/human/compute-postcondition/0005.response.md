Output State: **new_arr is a list containing all elements from arr, but in reverse order.**

Explanation: The loop starts with `left` at the beginning of the array and `right` at the end. In each iteration, it appends either the element at `left` or `right` to `new_arr`, then moves `left` one step to the right and `right` one step to the left. This process continues until `left` surpasses `right`. Since the original array is sorted, appending elements in this manner results in a reversed version of the original array.
