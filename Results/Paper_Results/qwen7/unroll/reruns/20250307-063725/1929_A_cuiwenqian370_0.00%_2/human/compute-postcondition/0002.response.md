Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `left` to 0. Since `arr` and `new_arr` were already defined in the initial state and no operations were performed on them, their states remain unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is that `left` is now set to 0.
