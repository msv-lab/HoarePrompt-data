Output State: **`new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr`, but in reverse order; `max_beauty` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `max_beauty` to 0. This does not affect the value of `new_arr`. Therefore, `new_arr` remains a list containing all elements from `arr`, but in reverse order, and `max_beauty` is set to 0.
