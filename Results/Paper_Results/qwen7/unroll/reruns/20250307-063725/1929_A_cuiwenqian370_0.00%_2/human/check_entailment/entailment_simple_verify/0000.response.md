### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = func_1(n, arr)
    results.append(result)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    new_arr = []
    left = 0
    right = n - 1
    while left <= right:
        if left == right:
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        else:
            new_arr.append(arr[right])
            new_arr.append(arr[left])
        
        left += 1
        
        right -= 1
        
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_beauty += abs(new_arr[i] - new_arr[i - 1])
    return max_beauty
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code explains that the function `func_1` sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements to form a new array `new_arr`. It then calculates the beauty of this new array.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the maximum beauty is achieved. Specifically, the approach of sorting the array and then alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements does not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

The suggested correction involves sorting the array and then pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.

#### Analysis:
1. **Sorting and Pairing Strategy**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are adjacent when paired.
   - Pairing the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, etc., maximizes the differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Correctness of the Given Program**:
   - The given program sorts the array and then alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - This approach does not necessarily maximize the differences between consecutive elements. For example, consider the array `[3, 4, 3, 3]`:
     - Sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
     - Alternating gives `[4, 3, 3, 3]`.
     - The beauty is `|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1`.

3. **Correct Solution**:
   - The suggested correction pairs the smallest and largest elements, which is indeed the correct approach.
   - For the same example `[3, 4, 3, 3]`:
     - Pairing gives `[3, 4, 3, 3]` (after sorting).
     - The beauty is `|4 - 3| + |3 - 3| = 1`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty.
   - The suggested correction is correct and ensures the maximum beauty is achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate, and the given program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The suggested correction is necessary to ensure the maximum beauty is achieved.
