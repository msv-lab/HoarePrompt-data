Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` initialized to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

3. **Initial State of `new_arr` and `max_beauty`**:
   - `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr`, but in reverse order.
   - `max_beauty` is 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 1, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
