Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

2. The annotated program reads the number of test cases, processes each test case, and calls the `func_1` function to compute the maximum beauty.

3. In the `func_1` function:
   - The array `arr` is sorted.
   - A new array `new_arr` is constructed by appending elements from the end and start of the sorted array alternately until all elements are used.
   - The maximum beauty is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` starting from index 1 to \( n-1 \).

4. The logic in `func_1` aims to maximize the beauty by ensuring the largest and smallest elements are placed next to each other in the new array, which is a valid approach to maximize the sum of absolute differences.

5. The program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum beauty as per the problem statement.
