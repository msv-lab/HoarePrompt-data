You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and arr is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.

    arr.sort()

    #State: Output State: `new_arr` is a list containing all elements from `arr` in reverse order; `max_beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` starting from index 1 to n-1.
    return max_beauty
    #The program returns the maximum beauty which is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the reversed list `new_arr` starting from index 1 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `arr` of `n` integers (each in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9). It first sorts the list `arr`, then creates a new list `new_arr` by appending elements from `arr` in reverse order. After that, it calculates the maximum beauty, defined as the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in `new_arr` starting from index 1 to n-1. Finally, it returns this maximum beauty.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The logic in `func_1` does not ensure that the maximum beauty is achieved. Specifically, the approach of sorting the array and then alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements does not always yield the maximum possible beauty.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
3 4 3 3
```
The expected output is `1`, but the program might output a different value because it does not guarantee the optimal arrangement.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should aim to maximize the differences between consecutive elements. One effective strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences are maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, arr):
    arr.sort()
    max_beauty = 0
    for i in range(n // 2):
        max_beauty += arr[n - 1 - i] - arr[i]
    if n % 2 != 0:
        max_beauty += arr[n // 2]
    return max_beauty
```

This approach ensures that the maximum beauty is calculated correctly for all cases.
