Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list `arr` of `n` integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9. It returns the maximum beauty, which is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the reversed list `new_arr` starting from index 1 to n-1.**
