Let's think through this step by step:

1. The loop condition is `left <= right`.
2. We need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, meaning `left` should be less than or equal to `right` at the start of the loop.

Given the initial states:
- `arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9.
- `new_arr` is an empty list.
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is n - 1.

We need to check if the loop condition `left <= right` is satisfied initially:
- `left` is 0.
- `right` is n - 1.

Since `left` (0) is indeed less than or equal to `right` (n - 1), the loop condition is already satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `left` or `right` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is n - 1**
