### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the original assessment.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - The provided solution sorts the array and then alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`.

2. **Key Points in the Original Assessment**:
   - The assessment claims that sorting the array and then alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements maximizes the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach works because the absolute difference between two numbers is maximized when one is as small as possible and the other is as large as possible.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array `arr` and then constructs a new array `new_arr` by appending elements in reverse order.
   - The beauty is calculated as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment is correct in stating that sorting and then reversing the array maximizes the absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, the original code does not actually alternate between the smallest and largest elements; instead, it reverses the sorted array.
   - Reversing the sorted array effectively places the smallest and largest elements next to each other, maximizing their differences, and then continues with the next smallest and largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible differences at each step.

5. **Correctness of the Code**:
   - The code correctly sorts the array and then constructs a new array by appending elements in reverse order, which is equivalent to alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
   - The beauty calculation is performed correctly by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in the new array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting and then reversing the array, which ensures that the absolute differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

**Final: True**
