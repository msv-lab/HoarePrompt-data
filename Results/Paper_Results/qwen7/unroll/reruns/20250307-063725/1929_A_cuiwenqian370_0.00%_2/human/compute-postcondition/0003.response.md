Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9; `new_arr` is an empty list; `left` is 0; `right` is n - 1.**

The code assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `right`. The initial state of `arr`, `new_arr`, and `left` remains unchanged. Therefore, `arr` is still a sorted list of n integers, `new_arr` is still an empty list, and `left` is still 0. The new value of `right` is `n - 1`.
