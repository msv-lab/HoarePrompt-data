### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided solution and the annotated code to determine if it correctly maximizes the beauty of the array.

1. **Sorting and Rearranging:**
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and then alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`.
   - This approach aims to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Constructing `new_arr`:**
   - The construction of `new_arr` ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed next to each other, which maximizes their difference.
   - However, the specific pattern of alternating between the smallest and largest elements might not always yield the optimal result. For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
     - Sorting gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - Alternating gives `[1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - The beauty is calculated as `|4-1| + |2-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.
     - However, the optimal arrangement would be `[1, 3, 2, 4]` with a beauty of `|3-1| + |2-3| + |4-2| = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5`.

3. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - The optimal strategy to maximize the beauty is to place the smallest element next to the largest element, and so on.
   - This can be achieved by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest and largest elements together.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The provided solution does not guarantee the optimal arrangement. It only alternates between the smallest and largest elements, which may not always yield the maximum beauty.
   - Consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`:
     - Sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
     - Alternating gives `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` with a beauty of `|100-43| + |54-100| + |90-54| + |80-90| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 149`.
     - The optimal arrangement would be `[43, 100, 54, 90, 80]` with a beauty of `|100-43| + |54-100| + |90-54| + |80-90| = 57 + 46 + 36 + 10 = 149`.

Given these observations, the provided solution does not always yield the maximum beauty. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
