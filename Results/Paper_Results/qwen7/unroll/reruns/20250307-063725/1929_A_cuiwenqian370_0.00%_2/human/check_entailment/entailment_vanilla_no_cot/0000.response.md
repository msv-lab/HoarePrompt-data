Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting and Rearranging**: For each test case, it sorts the array and then rearranges it by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
3. **Calculating Beauty**: After rearranging, it calculates the beauty of the array as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
4. **Output**: It outputs the maximum beauty for each test case.

The logic in `func_1` correctly maximizes the beauty by ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible, which is achieved by alternating the smallest and largest elements in the sorted array. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem statement.
