Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements.
2. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
3. The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
4. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
5. The `func_1` function sorts the array, then constructs a new array `new_arr` by appending elements from the original array in reverse order.
6. The logic for constructing `new_arr` ensures that the largest elements are placed at the beginning and end of the sequence, which helps maximize the differences between consecutive elements.
7. The function then calculates the maximum beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements in `new_arr`.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the provided program correctly implements the solution to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements.

Correctness: **True**
