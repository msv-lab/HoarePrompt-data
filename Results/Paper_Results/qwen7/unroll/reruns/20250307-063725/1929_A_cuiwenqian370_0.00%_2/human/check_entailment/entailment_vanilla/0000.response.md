Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
2. The provided solution sorts the array and then alternates between appending the smallest and largest remaining elements to `new_arr`. This approach aims to maximize the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
3. After constructing `new_arr`, the solution calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
4. Let's analyze the correctness of this approach:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest and largest elements are placed next to each other, maximizing their difference.
   - By alternating between the smallest and largest remaining elements, we ensure that the differences are maximized at every step.
   - This approach works because the absolute difference between two numbers is maximized when one is as small as possible and the other is as large as possible.
5. The example cases provided in the problem statement support this approach:
   - For the array `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]` and rearranging as `[1, 3, 2]` results in a beauty of `2`.
   - For the array `[69, 69, 69]`, the beauty remains `0` regardless of the order since all elements are the same.
   - For the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting and rearranging as `[43, 100, 54, 80, 90]` results in a beauty of `57`.

Given the analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the beauty of the array by sorting and rearranging the elements as described.

Correctness: **True**
