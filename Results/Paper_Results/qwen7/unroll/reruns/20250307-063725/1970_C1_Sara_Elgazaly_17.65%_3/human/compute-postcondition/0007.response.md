Output State: **`s` is now the opposite of its initial state, and all elements in the list `lst[x]` are emptied.**

Explanation: The variable `s` is flipped using the `not` operator, which means if `s` was initially `True`, it is now `False`, and if `s` was initially `False`, it is now `True`. Additionally, the list `lst[x]` is emptied, meaning it no longer contains any elements.
