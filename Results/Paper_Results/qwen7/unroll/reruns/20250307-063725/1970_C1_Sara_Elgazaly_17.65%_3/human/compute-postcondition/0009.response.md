Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but works with predefined integer values n, t, u, v, and a list of integers representing the starting node(s). It returns information about the tree structure, specifically identifying if the given nodes u and v are leaves and ensuring the tree has exactly two leaves.**

Note: The function does not explicitly accept parameters `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, and the list of integers, but these are implied from the problem constraints and are used within the function to determine the tree's structure and validate the conditions.
