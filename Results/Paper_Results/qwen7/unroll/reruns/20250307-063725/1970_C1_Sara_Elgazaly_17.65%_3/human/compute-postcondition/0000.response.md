Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y` respectively. The conditions on `n`, `t`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged.
