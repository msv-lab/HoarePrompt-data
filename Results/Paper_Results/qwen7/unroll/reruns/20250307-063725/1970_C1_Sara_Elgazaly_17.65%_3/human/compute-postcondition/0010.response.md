Functionality: **The function processes a tree structure defined by its edges and two specific nodes \(u\) and \(v\). It checks whether the two nodes are leaves (i.e., nodes with only one edge) and ensures the tree has exactly two leaves. If the condition is met, it prints 'Hermione'; otherwise, it prints 'Ron'.**
