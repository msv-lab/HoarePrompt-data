Output State: **`x` is an integer obtained from the first input, `y` is an integer obtained from the second input, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, `t` is an integer such that t = 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element; `lst` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list.**

Explanation: The code initializes a defaultdict named `lst` with the default factory set to list. This means that when accessing a key that does not exist in `lst`, a new list will be created automatically. None of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`) are affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values remain as they were in the initial state.
