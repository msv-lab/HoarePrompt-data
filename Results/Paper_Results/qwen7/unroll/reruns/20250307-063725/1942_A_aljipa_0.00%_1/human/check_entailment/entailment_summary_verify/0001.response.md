### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires generating an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of the `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k == n`, it means all cyclic shifts must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If `k == 1`, one specific cyclic shift must be sorted, while others must not be.
   - For other values of `k`, the solution provided does not handle the construction of such an array, which is a critical part of the problem.

3. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks if `k == n` and returns `[1] * n` (an array of `n` ones), which ensures all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If `k == 1`, it returns a range of numbers from `0` to `n-1`, ensuring only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - If neither condition is met, it returns `-1`, indicating no valid array exists.

4. **Validation**:
   - The provided solution correctly handles the edge cases for `k == n` and `k == 1`.
   - However, the original assessment incorrectly concluded that the solution does not provide a general solution for other values of `k`. In fact, the function does handle the general case by returning `-1`, which is the correct response when no valid array can be constructed for those values of `k`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function correctly identifies when a valid array cannot be constructed (`k > 1` and `k < n`), and returns `-1` in such cases.
   - The function also correctly handles the edge cases where a valid array can be constructed (`k == n` or `k == 1`).

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment incorrectly stated that the solution does not provide a general solution for other values of `k`. The function correctly returns `-1` for such cases, which is the appropriate response according to the problem statement.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
