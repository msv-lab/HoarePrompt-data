State: **`t` must be an integer greater than 0, and for each test case, `n` and `k` must satisfy 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3**.

### Explanation:
1. **`t`**: The variable `t` is initialized by taking an integer input from the user. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because the loop runs `t` times. If `t` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute.
   
2. **Test Cases**: Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k`. The constraints for these variables are given as 1 ≤ `k` ≤ `n` ≤ 10^3. These constraints ensure that the loop body can safely access valid values for `n` and `k` within the specified range.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, the state must include that `t` is a positive integer and for each test case, `n` and `k` must satisfy the given constraints.
