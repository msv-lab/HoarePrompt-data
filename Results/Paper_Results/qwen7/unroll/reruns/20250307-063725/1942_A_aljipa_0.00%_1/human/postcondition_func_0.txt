The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it generates and prints one of three possible outputs: a list of \( n \) ones if \( k \) equals \( n \), a range from 0 to \( n-1 \) if \( k \) equals 1, or \(-1\) otherwise. The function reads the number of test cases \( t \) first, then iterates through each test case, performing the specified output generation and printing.
