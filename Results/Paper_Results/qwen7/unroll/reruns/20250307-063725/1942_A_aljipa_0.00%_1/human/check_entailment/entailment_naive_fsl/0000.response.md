Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is neither equal to `n` nor `1`. According to the problem description, if there is no valid array `a`, the output should be `-1`. However, the program always prints a list of `1`s if `k == n` and a range of numbers from `0` to `n-1` if `k == 1`. For any other value of `k`, it prints `-1`, which is correct. But the program does not generate a valid array `a` for these cases, which is required by the problem description.

To fix this, the program needs to generate a valid array `a` for the cases where `1 < k < n`. Here is an example of how the program could be modified to generate a valid array:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n
        elif k == 1:
            res = list(range(n))
        else:
            # Generate a valid array for 1 < k < n
            res = [1] * (n - k) + [2] * k
        print(*res)
```

This modified program will generate a valid array for all cases, ensuring the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
