### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires generating an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` out of the `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k == n`, it means all cyclic shifts must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same.
   - If `k == 1`, one specific cyclic shift must be sorted, while others must not be.
   - For other values of `k`, it becomes more complex, but the provided solution handles these edge cases correctly.
3. **Solution Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It then checks if `k == n` and returns `[1] * n` (an array of `n` ones), which ensures all cyclic shifts are sorted.
   - If `k == 1`, it returns a range of numbers from `0` to `n-1`, ensuring only one cyclic shift (the original array) is sorted.
   - If neither condition is met, it returns `-1`, indicating no valid array exists.
4. **Validation**:
   - The provided solution correctly handles the edge cases for `k == n` and `k == 1`.
   - However, for other values of `k`, the solution does not provide a valid array, as the problem statement does not specify how to construct such an array for general `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is correct for the edge cases where `k == n` or `k == 1`. However, it does not provide a general solution for other values of `k`, which is required by the problem statement.
