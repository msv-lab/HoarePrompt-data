Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. The logic for determining the result is as follows:
   - If `k == n`, it prints a list of `n` ones (`[1] * n`).
   - If `k == 1`, it prints a range from `0` to `n-1` (`range(n)`).
   - Otherwise, it prints `-1`.

However, this logic does not fully address the problem requirements. Specifically:
- For `k == n`, the requirement is that all cyclic shifts must be sorted. This can only happen if all elements in the array are the same (e.g., `[1, 1, 1, ...]`), but the program simply prints a list of `n` ones without ensuring that all cyclic shifts are sorted.
- For `k == 1`, the requirement is that exactly one cyclic shift must be sorted. The program prints a range from `0` to `n-1`, which does not guarantee that exactly one cyclic shift will be sorted.

To meet the problem requirements, we need to construct an array that ensures exactly `k` cyclic shifts are sorted. Hereâ€™s a corrected approach:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        # Construct an array with exactly k sorted cyclic shifts
        if k == n:
            res = [1] * n  # All elements are the same, so all cyclic shifts are sorted
        elif k == 1:
            # Create an array with exactly one sorted cyclic shift
            res = [1] + [2] * (n - 1)  # First element is 1, rest are 2
        else:
            res = [-1]  # No valid array exists
        
        print(*res)
```

Given the above analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is:

Correctness: **False**
