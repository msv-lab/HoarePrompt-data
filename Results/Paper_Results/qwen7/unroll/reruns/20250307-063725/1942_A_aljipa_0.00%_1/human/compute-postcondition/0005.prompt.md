You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = (int(i) for i in input().split())
        
        res = [1] * n if k == n else range(n) if k == 1 else [-1]
        
        print(*res)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing either a list of 1s of length `n`, a range from 0 to `n-1`, or `-1`. The number of lines and their contents depend on the input values for `t`, `n`, and `k` provided by the user. Each line corresponds to one iteration of the loop, where `t` is the total number of iterations. If `k` equals `n`, the line will contain a list of `n` 1s. If `k` equals 1, the line will contain a range from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, the line will contain `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs (n and k) within a test case where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. It returns information based on the values of n and k.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
