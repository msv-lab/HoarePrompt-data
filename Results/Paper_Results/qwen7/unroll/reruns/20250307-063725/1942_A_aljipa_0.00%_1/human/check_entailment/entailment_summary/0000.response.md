Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating specific arrays based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \):

1. If \( k \) equals \( n \), it prints a list of \( n \) ones.
2. If \( k \) equals 1, it prints a range from 0 to \( n-1 \).
3. Otherwise, it prints \(-1\).

However, this approach does not correctly address the requirement that exactly \( k \) out of the \( n \) cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. Instead, it uses a fixed pattern that does not ensure the exact number of sorted cyclic shifts as required by the problem statement.

To verify correctness, let's analyze the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. For the input `2 2`, the expected output is `[1, 1]` because both cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. For the input `3 1`, the expected output is a sequence where only one cyclic shift is sorted, such as `[69420, 69, 420]`.
3. For the input `3 2`, the expected output is `-1` because it is impossible to have exactly two sorted cyclic shifts with the given constraints.

The current implementation does not generate arrays that meet these requirements. It simply checks if \( k \) is equal to \( n \) or 1, which does not guarantee the correct number of sorted cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
