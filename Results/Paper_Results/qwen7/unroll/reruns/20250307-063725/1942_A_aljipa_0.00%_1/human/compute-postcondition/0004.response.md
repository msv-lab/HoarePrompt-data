Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs (n and k) within a test case where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. It returns information based on the values of n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts parameters `n` and `k` through a test case structure where `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it checks if `k` is less than or equal to `n`, both of which are integers within specified ranges, and returns some form of output based on these values.
