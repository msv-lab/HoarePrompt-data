Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing either a list of 1s of length `n`, a range from 0 to `n-1`, or `-1`. The number of lines and their contents depend on the input values for `t`, `n`, and `k` provided by the user. Each line corresponds to one iteration of the loop, where `t` is the total number of iterations. If `k` equals `n`, the line will contain a list of `n` 1s. If `k` equals 1, the line will contain a range from 0 to `n-1`. Otherwise, the line will contain `-1`.
