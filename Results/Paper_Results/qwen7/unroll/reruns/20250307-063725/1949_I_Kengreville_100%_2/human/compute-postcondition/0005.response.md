Output State: **`visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef` is now a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

Explanation: The code `coef = [None] * n` creates a new list `coef` with `n` elements, all set to `None`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the lengths and initial states of the lists `visited`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef` remain the same, but `coef` is now explicitly stated to be a list of `None` values of length `n`.
