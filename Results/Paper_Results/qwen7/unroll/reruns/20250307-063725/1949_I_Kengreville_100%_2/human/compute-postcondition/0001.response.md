Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where for each 0 ≤ i < n, `y[i]` and `r[i]` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `y[i]`, `r[i]` ≤ 10^9, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

The code `x = [None] * n` initializes the list `x` to a list of `None` values of length `n`. The values of `n`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial states.
