Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` where for each 0 ≤ i < n, `x[i]`, `y[i]` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `x[i]`, `y[i]` ≤ 10^9, and `r[i]` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `r[i]` ≤ 10^9; `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`; `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The lengths and contents of the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged, and they retain their initial conditions as specified in the initial state.
