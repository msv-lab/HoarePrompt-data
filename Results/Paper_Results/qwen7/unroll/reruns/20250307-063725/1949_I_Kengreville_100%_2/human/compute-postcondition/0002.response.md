Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of integers of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

Explanation: The line `y = [None] * n` initializes a new list `y` with `n` elements, each set to `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
