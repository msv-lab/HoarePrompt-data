Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. The lists `visited`, `x`, `y`, `r`, and `coef` retain their initial lengths and contents, and the variable `tot` remains unchanged.
