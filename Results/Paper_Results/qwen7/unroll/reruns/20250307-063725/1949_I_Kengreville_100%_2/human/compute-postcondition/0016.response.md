Based on the initial state provided:

- `bipartite` is a boolean value (`True` or `False`) determined by the `dfs` function.
- `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n`, where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited during any of the iterations.
- `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of integers of length `n` with their original values unchanged.
- `coef` is a list of integer values (either 1 or `None`) of length `n`, where each element is `1` if the corresponding node was visited during any of the iterations and the path was bipartite and non-zero.
- `tot` is an integer representing the sum of `coef` values for nodes that satisfy the bipartite condition and have a non-zero `tot` value.
- `ok` is `True`.

The `print('YES')` statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any of the variables or objects from the initial state.

Output: **YES**
