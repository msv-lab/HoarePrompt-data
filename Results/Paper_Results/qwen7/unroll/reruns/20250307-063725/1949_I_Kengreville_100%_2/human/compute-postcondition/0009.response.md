Output State: **`visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. This is the only change made to the variables. All other lists (`visited`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `coef`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
