Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` where each element is input from the user, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `tot` is 0, `ok` is False.**

The variable `ok` is assigned the value `False`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the other variables retain their initial states.
