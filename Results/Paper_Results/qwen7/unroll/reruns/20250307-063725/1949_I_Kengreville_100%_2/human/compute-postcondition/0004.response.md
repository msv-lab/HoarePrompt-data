Output State: **`visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`**.

Explanation: The code `visited = [False] * n` initializes the `visited` list to a list of `n` boolean values, each set to `False`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
