Output State: `bipartite` is True or False based on the `dfs` function's outcome, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where each element is True if the corresponding node was visited during any of the iterations, `x` is a list of integers of length `n` with original values unchanged, `y` is a list of integers of length `n` with original values unchanged, `r` is a list of integers of length `n` with original values unchanged, `coef` is a list of integer values (either 1 or None) of length `n` where each element is 1 if the corresponding node was visited during any of the iterations and the path was bipartite and non-zero, `tot` is an integer representing the sum of `coef` values for nodes that satisfy the bipartite condition and have a non-zero `tot` value, `ok` is True if any iteration of the loop found a bipartite component with a non-zero `tot` value, otherwise False.
