Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `y` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `r` is a list of `None` values of length `n`, `visited` is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to `False`, `coef` is a list of `None` values of length `n`.**

The code `r = [None] * n` creates a new list `r` of length `n` where each element is `None`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the lengths and initial values of the lists `x`, `y`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged.
