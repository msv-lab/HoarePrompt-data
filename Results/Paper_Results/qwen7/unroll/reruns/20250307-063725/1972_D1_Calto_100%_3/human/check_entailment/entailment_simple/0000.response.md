### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code provided includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2` is supposed to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) but does not actually implement the logic required by the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes `cnt` to -1.
   - It then iterates from 1 to \(m\).
   - For each \(i\), it calculates \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y = i * i\).
   - It updates `cnt` with `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)`, which does not seem to be related to the problem's requirements.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To solve the problem, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not perform this check and instead uses a formula that does not align with the problem's constraints.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
