### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Reviewing the Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The current implementation does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:**
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\).
   - It then adds \(\text{math.ceil}(x / y) + (x \% y == 0)\) to `cnt`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem's constraints. Specifically, it does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variables \(x\) and \(y\) do not have any direct relation to the problem's requirements. The expression \(n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(i^2\) do not represent valid values for \(a\) and \(b\) in the context of the problem.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the function is incorrect.

### Correctness:
The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_2` is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's constraints. However, there is a misunderstanding in the final conclusion of the original assessment. The original assessment concludes that the function is incorrect, which is accurate based on the provided logic.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the function `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem.
