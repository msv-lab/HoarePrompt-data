Reasoning:
- The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs (a, b) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- Function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is correct.
- Function `func_2` is intended to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) based on the given conditions. However, the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. Specifically:
  - The variables `x` and `y` are calculated as `n - (i * i - i)` and `i * i` respectively, which do not seem to be related to the problem's constraints.
  - The update of `cnt` with `math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)` also does not align with the problem's requirements.
- Given the discrepancy between the expected logic and the actual implementation in `func_2`, the function will not produce the correct results for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
