The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, both within the range of 1 to 2â‹…10^6. It initializes a counter `cnt` to -1. For each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, it calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`. Then, it updates `cnt` by adding the result of `math.ceil(x / y)` plus 1 if `x % y` equals 0. Finally, the function returns -1 regardless of the calculations performed.
