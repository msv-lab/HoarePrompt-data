### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Reviewing the Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

3. **Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:**
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\).
   - It then adds \(\text{math.ceil}(x / y) + (x \% y == 0)\) to `cnt`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variables \(x\) and \(y\) do not have any direct relation to the problem's requirements.

5. **Detailed Analysis of `func_2`:**
   - Let's consider the example test cases provided:
     - For \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\), the expected output is 14.
     - The function `func_2` should iterate over possible values of \(b\) and for each \(b\), find valid \(a\) such that \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
     - However, the current implementation does not perform this check.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\), calculating \(\gcd(a, b)\), and checking if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Conclusion:
- The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
