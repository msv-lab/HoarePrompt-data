Reasoning:
Let's analyze the problem and the provided functions to determine if they correctly solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \leq a \leq n\)
2. \(1 \leq b \leq m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Function `func_1`
This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. This is correct and necessary for solving the problem, but it is not used in the main logic of the solution.

### Function `func_2`
The function `func_2` uses a different approach to solve the problem. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Initialization**: The counter `cnt` is initialized to -1.
2. **Loop through possible values of \(b\)**: For each \(i\) from 1 to \(m\):
   - Calculate \(x = n - (i * i - i)\).
   - Calculate \(y = i * i\).
   - Update `cnt` by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` plus 1 if `x % y == 0`.

### Analysis of `func_2` Logic
- The calculation of \(x = n - (i * i - i)\) does not seem directly related to the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
- The loop iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), which suggests an attempt to find valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(b = i\). However, this does not cover all possible values of \(a\) and \(b\).
- The update of `cnt` using `math.ceil(x / y)` and checking `x % y == 0` does not align with the required condition.

### Conclusion
The logic in `func_2` does not correctly implement the required condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Therefore, the function will not produce the correct results for the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
