### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Reviewing the Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to solve the problem but does not follow the correct logic.

3. **Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:**
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\).
   - It then adds \(\text{math.ceil}(x / y) + (x \% y == 0)\) to `cnt`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variables \(x\) and \(y\) do not have any direct relation to the problem's requirements.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The provided function summary states that the function returns `-1` regardless of the calculations performed. This is incorrect because the function should be returning the count of valid pairs, not `-1`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The provided function summary also does not accurately describe the function's behavior.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
