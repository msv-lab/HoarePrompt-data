### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1`:
This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it is not used in the main logic of the program, which is a critical flaw since the problem requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) based on their GCD.

#### Function `func_2`:
The function `func_2` is problematic and does not solve the given problem. Here's why:
1. **Incorrect Logic**: The function `func_2` attempts to calculate a count based on some operations involving \(i^2 - i\) and \(i^2\), which have no relation to the problem constraints \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
     - Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
     - Expected output: 3
     - Actual output from the provided code: -1 (since the function always returns -1)

Given these observations, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on the given constraints.
