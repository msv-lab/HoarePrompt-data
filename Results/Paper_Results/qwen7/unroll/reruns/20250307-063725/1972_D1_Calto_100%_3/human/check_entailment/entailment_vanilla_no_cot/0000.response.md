Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Let's break down why:

1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. This part is fine and not the issue here.

2. **Main Logic**: The `func_2` function attempts to count the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` but uses an incorrect approach. Specifically, it tries to calculate something related to squares and multiples, which is not relevant to the problem statement.

### Correct Approach:
To solve the problem, we need to iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` and check if they satisfy the condition `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    cnt = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            gcd_ab = func_1(a, b)
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd_ab) == 0:
                cnt += 1
    return cnt

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

This code correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)` by iterating through all possible values and checking the condition.
