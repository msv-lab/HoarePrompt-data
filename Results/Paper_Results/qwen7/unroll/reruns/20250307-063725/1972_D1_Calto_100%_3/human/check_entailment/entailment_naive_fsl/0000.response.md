Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the problem statement which requires counting ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is not used in the solution. The function `func_2` seems to be an attempt to solve a different problem, as it involves operations that do not relate to the given constraints and conditions.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)

Expected output: We need to check all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \le a \le 2\) and \(1 \le b \le 3\):

- For \((1, 1)\): \(1 + 1 = 2\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(1, 1) = 1\). Since \(2\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \((1, 2)\): \(1 + 2 = 3\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(1, 2) = 2\). Since \(3\) is not a multiple of \(2\), this pair is invalid.
- For \((1, 3)\): \(1 + 3 = 4\) and \(3 \cdot \gcd(1, 3) = 3\). Since \(4\) is not a multiple of \(3\), this pair is invalid.
- For \((2, 1)\): \(2 + 1 = 3\) and \(1 \cdot \gcd(2, 1) = 1\). Since \(3\) is a multiple of \(1\), this pair is valid.
- For \((2, 2)\): \(2 + 2 = 4\) and \(2 \cdot \gcd(2, 2) = 4\). Since \(4\) is a multiple of \(4\), this pair is valid.

So, the valid pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), and \((2, 2)\), making the total count 3.

However, running the provided program with \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\) will give a different result because the logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
