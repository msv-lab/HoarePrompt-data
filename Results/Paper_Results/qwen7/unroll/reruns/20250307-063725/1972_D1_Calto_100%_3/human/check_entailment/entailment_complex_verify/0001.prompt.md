You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        y = i * i
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
    return cnt



- Annotated Code: 
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_2(n, m)
    print(result)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State: a is the gcd of the original a and b, and b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns a, which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original a and b, and b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` as input, calculates their greatest common divisor (gcd), and returns `a` as the gcd value while setting `b` to 0.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    cnt = -1
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        x = n - (i * i - i)
        
        y = i * i
        
        cnt = cnt + math.ceil(x / y) + (x % y == 0)
        
    #State: cnt is -1.
    return cnt
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, n and m, both within the range of 1 to 2⋅10^6. It initializes a counter `cnt` to -1. For each integer `i` from 1 to `m`, it calculates `x` as `n - (i * i - i)` and `y` as `i * i`. Then, it updates `cnt` by adding the result of `math.ceil(x / y)` plus 1 if `x % y` equals 0. Finally, the function returns -1 regardless of the calculations performed.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Reviewing the Provided Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\) using the Euclidean algorithm. It is implemented correctly.
   - `func_2(n, m)`: This function attempts to solve the problem but does not seem to follow the problem's constraints or logic correctly.

3. **Analyzing `func_2(n, m)`:**
   - The function iterates over \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).
   - It calculates \(x = n - (i^2 - i)\) and \(y = i^2\).
   - It then adds \(\text{math.ceil}(x / y) + (x \% y == 0)\) to `cnt`.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic inside `func_2` does not match the problem statement. Specifically, it does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The variables \(x\) and \(y\) do not have any direct relation to the problem's requirements.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `func_2` does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem, the function is incorrect.
