State: **`cnt` is -1, `i` is 1, `m` must be greater than 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `m`.
2. The loop `for i in range(1, m + 1):` will start with `i` set to 1 and increment `i` until `i` is greater than `m`.
3. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0 because if `m` is 0 or negative, the range function will not generate any values for `i`.
4. The initial value of `cnt` (-1) does not affect the loop's execution condition, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` being set to 1 (the starting value of the range function), `m` being greater than 0 (to ensure the range function generates at least one value for `i`), and `cnt` remains as -1 since it is not part of the loop head.
