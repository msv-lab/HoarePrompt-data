### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. However, it is not used in the main function `func_2`.
   - **Function `func_2`**: The logic inside `func_2` is incorrect. It does not follow the required conditions of the problem. Specifically:
     - The variable `x` is calculated as \(n - (i * i - i)\).
     - The variable `y` is calculated as \(i * i\).
     - The counter `cnt` is updated by adding `math.ceil(x / y)` plus 1 if `x % y` equals 0.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The GCD calculation should be used to ensure the condition is met.

4. **Revised Logic**:
   - We should use a nested loop to iterate over all pairs \((a, b)\).
   - For each pair, compute the GCD of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - Count the valid pairs.

5. **Original Assessment Revisited**:
   - The original assessment correctly identified that the provided program does not solve the problem as stated.
   - The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not align with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the given problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
