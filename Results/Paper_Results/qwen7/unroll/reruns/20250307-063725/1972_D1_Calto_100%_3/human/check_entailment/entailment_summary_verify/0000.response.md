Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summaries provided.

### Problem Description Recap
We need to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

### Function Summaries Recap
- **Function 1**: This function calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. It is correctly implemented and can be used to find \(\gcd(a, b)\).
- **Function 2**: The function initializes a counter `cnt` to -1. For each integer \(i\) from 1 to \(m\), it calculates \(x\) as \(n - (i * i - i)\) and \(y\) as \(i * i\). Then, it updates `cnt` by adding the result of `math.ceil(x / y)` plus 1 if `x % y` equals 0. Finally, the function returns -1 regardless of the calculations performed.

### Analysis
1. **Function 1**: This function is correct and will be used to compute \(\gcd(a, b)\).
2. **Function 2**: The logic in `func_2` does not align with the problem requirements. Specifically:
   - The calculation of `x` and `y` does not relate to the problem constraints.
   - The condition `x % y == 0` is not relevant to the problem.
   - The function returns -1, which is incorrect.

Given these observations, let's write a correct implementation of the problem.

### Correct Implementation
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))
```

### Verification
Let's verify the correct implementation with the example test case:
- Input: \(n = 2\), \(m = 3\)

Expected output:
- Valid pairs: \((1, 1)\), \((2, 1)\), \((2, 2)\)
- Total count: 3

Running the correct implementation:
```python
n, m = 2, 3
print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))  # Output: 3
```

The correct implementation gives the expected output of 3, confirming its correctness.

### Conclusion
The original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly solve the problem due to the incorrect logic in `func_2`.

Final: **False**
