Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of `t`**: According to the given information, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, and this value is an integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\) inclusive.
3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `t` must be true (i.e., non-zero).

Given that `t` is an integer input, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time is ensuring that `t` is non-zero.

Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\), it is guaranteed to be non-zero. Therefore, no additional adjustments are necessary.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and \(2 \times 10^4\) inclusive**
