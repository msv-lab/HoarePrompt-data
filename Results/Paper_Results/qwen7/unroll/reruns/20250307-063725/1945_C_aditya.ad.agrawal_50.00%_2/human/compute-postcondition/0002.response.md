Output State: **The output state will be a list of integers representing the positions found during each iteration of the loop. Each position is the index (1-based) where the balance condition is met or exceeded for the first time.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is initially provided as input.
- For each iteration, it reads `n`, an integer, and `arr`, a string of '0's and '1's.
- It calculates the counts of '0's (`z`) and '1's (`o`) in the array.
- It then iterates through the array, updating the counts of '0's on the left (`z_l`) and right (`z_r`), and '1's on the left (`o_l`) and right (`o_r`).
- During this iteration, it checks if the current position meets the conditions to update the best distance (`b_d`) and the answer (`ans`), which is the position.
- Finally, it prints the position (`ans`) and decrements `t`.
- After all iterations, the output state will be a list of these positions, one for each input set processed by the loop.
