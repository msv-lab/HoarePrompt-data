Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for i in sChar:`. The variables involved here are `i` and `sChar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `s` is an empty list (this variable is not used in the loop, so it doesn't affect the loop's execution).
   - `sChar` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000.

3. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `sChar` is not an empty string. If `sChar` is an empty string, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `sChar` is a binary string and not an empty list, the loop can execute if `sChar` is non-empty.
   - The variable `i` will take on each character of `sChar` one by one during the loop iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `sChar` must be a non-empty binary string.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`sChar` is a non-empty binary string**
