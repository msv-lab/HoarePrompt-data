Output State: **The list `s` has been modified such that all '1's appear before all '0's, with their original relative order preserved. The variable `cost` represents the total number of swaps performed during the process.**

Explanation: The loop iterates through the list `s` and swaps '1's with '0's when they are found on either side of each other. The `left` pointer moves right until it finds a '1', and the `right` pointer moves right until it finds a '0'. When both conditions are met, the elements at these positions are swapped, and the `cost` is incremented by the distance between `right` and `left` plus one. This continues until no more swaps can be made or the end of the list is reached. The result is a list where all '1's precede all '0's, maintaining their original sequence within their respective groups.
