### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its annotated version to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Key Points from the Annotated Code:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Converts the input string `sChar` into a list of characters.
   - Uses two pointers, `left` and `right`, to find the first '0' after a '1' and vice versa.
   - Swaps these characters and increments the cost by the length of the substring.
   - Continues this process until all '1's are moved to the beginning of the list.

2. **Behavior Analysis**:
   - The function attempts to swap adjacent '1's and '0's directly, which is not equivalent to performing cyclic shifts.
   - The logic inside the while loop is designed to move '1's to the front by swapping them with '0's, but it does not account for the cyclic nature of the shifts.
   - The function does not consider the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts that would minimize the total cost.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input string `101011`.

- **Optimal Solution**:
  - Perform the following cyclic shifts:
    1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]` and shift: `101011 -> 010111` (cost = 3).
    2. Choose the substring `[2, 6]` and shift: `010111 -> 001111` (cost = 5).
  - Total cost: 3 + 5 = 8.

- **Program Behavior**:
  - The function will attempt to swap adjacent '1's and '0's, which does not align with the optimal cyclic shifts.
  - For the same input `101011`, the function might perform more costly operations, leading to a higher cost than the optimal solution.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. It fails to account for the optimal sequence of cyclic shifts that minimizes the total cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
