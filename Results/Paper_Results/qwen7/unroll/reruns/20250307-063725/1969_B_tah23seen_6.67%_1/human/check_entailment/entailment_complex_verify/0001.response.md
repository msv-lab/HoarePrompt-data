### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` for easier manipulation. This step is necessary and correct.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable to keep track of the total cost. This initialization is correct.
   - The main logic involves moving the `left` and `right` pointers to find positions where a swap would help in sorting the string. However, there is a critical flaw in the logic.

3. **Swapping Mechanism**:
   - The swapping mechanism is intended to swap a '1' with a '0' when a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1'. However, the current implementation of the swapping logic is flawed. Specifically, the `while` loops that move the `left` and `right` pointers do not ensure that the entire string is processed correctly. The `left` and `right` pointers may get stuck in an infinite loop or miss some necessary swaps.

   - Consider the string "101011". The function will start with `left` at 0 and `right` at 1. When it finds a '0' at index 1 and a '1' at index 0, it will swap them and increment the cost. However, the `right` pointer will then move to index 2, and the `left` pointer will move to index 1. This process will continue, but it will miss the necessary swaps to fully sort the string.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the string is already sorted (`0000` in the example) correctly by returning `0`. This is correct.
   - The function also handles cases where no swaps are needed, which is also correctly handled by returning `0`. This is correct.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is done correctly by adding the length of the substring being swapped each time a swap is made. However, due to the flawed logic, the cost calculation may not reflect the true minimum cost.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement. However, the cost printed may not be the minimum cost due to the flawed logic.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the provided code is correct. While the input handling and edge case handling are correct, the core logic for finding and performing the minimum number of swaps is flawed. The swapping mechanism does not guarantee that the string will be sorted with the minimum possible cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
