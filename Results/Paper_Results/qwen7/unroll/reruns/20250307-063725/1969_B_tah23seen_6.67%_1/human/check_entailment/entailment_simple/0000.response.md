### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the input string `sChar` into a list `s` to facilitate easier manipulation.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers to traverse the list and find the positions where a swap is needed to move '1's to the front and '0's to the back.
   - The logic inside the while loop correctly identifies when a swap is needed (i.e., when a '0' is found before a '1') and performs the swap along with updating the cost.
   - The inner while loops correctly increment the `left` and `right` pointers to skip over '1's and '0's respectively, ensuring that the algorithm moves through the list efficiently.
   - After processing the entire list, the function returns the total cost of the swaps.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case, which is the correct output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost to sort the binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:
**True**
