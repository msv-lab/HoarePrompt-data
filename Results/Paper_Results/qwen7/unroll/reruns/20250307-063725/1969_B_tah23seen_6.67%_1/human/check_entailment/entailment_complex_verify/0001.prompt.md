You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            (s[right], s[left]) = (s[left], s[right])
            cost += right - left + 1
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    return cost



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, and `sChar` remains unchanged.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: The list `s` has been modified such that all '1's appear before all '0's, with their original relative order preserved. The variable `cost` represents the total number of swaps performed during the process.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) performed during the process of rearranging the list `s` such that all '1's appear before all '0's, with their original relative order preserved.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `sChar` and returns the total number of swaps required to rearrange the string so that all '1's appear before all '0's while preserving their original relative order. The function first converts the string into a list of characters, then iterates through the list to count the necessary swaps.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` for easier manipulation.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable to keep track of the total cost.
   - The main logic involves moving the `left` and `right` pointers to find positions where a swap would help in sorting the string.
   - When a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1', a swap is performed, and the cost is updated.
   - The `while` loops ensure that the pointers move through the string until they reach the end.

3. **Swapping Mechanism**:
   - The swapping mechanism is implemented correctly. When a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1', the elements at `left` and `right` are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
   - The inner `while` loops ensure that the `left` and `right` pointers move to the next relevant positions after a swap.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the string is already sorted (`0000` in the example) correctly by returning `0`.
   - The function also handles cases where no swaps are needed, which is also correctly handled by returning `0`.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is done correctly by adding the length of the substring being swapped each time a swap is made.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
