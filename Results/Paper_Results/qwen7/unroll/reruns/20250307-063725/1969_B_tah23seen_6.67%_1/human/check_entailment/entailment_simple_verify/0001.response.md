### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` for easier manipulation. This step is necessary and correct.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable to keep track of the total cost. This initialization is correct.
   - The main logic involves moving the `left` and `right` pointers to find positions where a swap would help in sorting the string. However, there is a critical flaw in this logic.

3. **Swapping Mechanism**:
   - The swapping mechanism is intended to swap a '1' with a '0' when a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1'. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the cyclic shift operation as described in the problem statement.
   - The `while` loops are used to move the `left` and `right` pointers to the next relevant positions, but they do not correctly simulate the cyclic shift. Instead, they perform a simple linear swap without considering the cyclic nature of the shift.

4. **Cyclic Shift vs. Linear Swap**:
   - A cyclic shift involves taking the last character and placing it before the first character, moving all other characters to the right. The current implementation performs a simple linear swap, which does not achieve the same effect.
   - For example, consider the string "101". The correct cyclic shift would be "011", but the current implementation might incorrectly swap the '1' and '0' to produce "011" without the correct cost calculation.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is done correctly by adding the length of the substring being swapped each time a swap is made. However, since the swaps are not correctly simulating the cyclic shift, the cost calculation is also incorrect.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the string is already sorted (`0000` in the example) correctly by returning `0`. However, it does not handle cases where a cyclic shift is needed to sort the string, leading to incorrect results.

7. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case, but due to the incorrect implementation of the cyclic shift, the output is not accurate.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the cyclic shift operation as required by the problem statement. The current implementation performs simple linear swaps instead of cyclic shifts, leading to incorrect results.

### Final:
**False**
