Output State: **`s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, `sChar` remains unchanged, `left` is 0.**

The variable `left` is initialized to 0. The initial state of `s` as a list containing all characters from `sChar` and the unchanged state of `sChar` remain unaffected by this line of code.
