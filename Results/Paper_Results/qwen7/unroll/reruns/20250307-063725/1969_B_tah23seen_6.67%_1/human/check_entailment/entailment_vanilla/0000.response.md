### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` for easier manipulation.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable to keep track of the total cost.
   - The main logic involves moving the `left` and `right` pointers to find positions where a swap would help in sorting the string.
   - When a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1', a swap is performed, and the cost is updated.
   - The `while` loops ensure that the pointers move through the string until they reach the end.

3. **Swapping Mechanism**:
   - The swapping mechanism is implemented correctly. When a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1', the elements at `left` and `right` are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
   - The inner `while` loops ensure that the `left` and `right` pointers move to the next relevant positions after a swap.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the string is already sorted (`0000` in the example) correctly by returning `0`.
   - The function also handles cases where no swaps are needed, which is also correctly handled by returning `0`.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is done correctly by adding the length of the substring being swapped each time a swap is made.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.
