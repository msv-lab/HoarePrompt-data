Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's with a length between 2 and 200000. After processing, the function returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) needed to rearrange the string so that all '1's come before all '0's while preserving their original relative order.**
