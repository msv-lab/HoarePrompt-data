Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, the program attempts to swap characters directly without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts. This approach will not always yield the minimum cost because it does not account for the optimal sequence of shifts that minimizes the total cost.

For example, consider the input string `101011`. The optimal solution involves performing the following cyclic shifts:
1. Choose the substring `[1, 3]` and shift: `101011 -> 010111` (cost = 3).
2. Choose the substring `[2, 6]` and shift: `010111 -> 001111` (cost = 5).

The total cost is 3 + 5 = 8, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 9. This discrepancy shows that the program does not handle the problem correctly.
