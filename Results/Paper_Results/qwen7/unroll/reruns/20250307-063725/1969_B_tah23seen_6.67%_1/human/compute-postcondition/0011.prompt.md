You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sChar is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000.
def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, and `sChar` remains unchanged.
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
        
    #State: The list `s` has been modified such that all '1's appear before all '0's, with their original relative order preserved. The variable `cost` represents the total number of swaps performed during the process.
    return cost
    #The program returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) performed during the process of rearranging the list `s` such that all '1's appear before all '0's, with their original relative order preserved.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `sChar`, which is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's with a length between 2 and 200000. After processing, the function returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) needed to rearrange the string so that all '1's come before all '0's while preserving their original relative order.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of swaps (`cost`) performed during the process of rearranging the list `s` such that all '1's appear before all '0's, with their original relative order preserved.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
