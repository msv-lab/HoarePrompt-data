### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the problem requirements and the original assessment.

#### Problem Requirements:
- We need to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
- Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.
- The goal is to minimize the total cost.

#### Given Program:
```python
t = int(input())
while t:
    s = input()
    print(func_1(s))
    t = t - 1

def func_1(sChar):
    s = []
    for i in sChar:
        s.append(i)
    
    left = 0
    cost = 0
    right = 1
    while left <= right and right < len(s) and (left < len(s)):
        if s[right] == '0' and s[left] == '1':
            s[right], s[left] = s[left], s[right]
            cost += right - left + 1
        
        while right < len(s) and s[right] != '0':
            right += 1
        
        while left < len(s) and s[left] != '1':
            left += 1
    
    return cost
```

#### Annotated Code:
- The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
- For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function to compute the cost.
- The `func_1` function converts the input string to a list of characters.
- It then iterates through the list, attempting to swap '1's and '0's when a '1' is found before a '0'.
- The cost is incremented by the length of the substring being swapped.
- The function returns the total cost.

#### Original Assessment:
- The assessment states that the program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost because it does not account for the optimal sequence of shifts that minimizes the total cost.
- The example given (`101011`) shows that the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 9 instead of the optimal cost of 8.

#### Analysis:
- The program attempts to swap '1's and '0's directly, which is not equivalent to performing cyclic shifts. Cyclic shifts involve moving the entire substring to the front, not just swapping individual characters.
- The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the cyclic nature of the shifts. It simply performs swaps, which does not necessarily minimize the total cost.

#### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required functionality of cyclic shifts and thus cannot compute the minimum total cost accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
