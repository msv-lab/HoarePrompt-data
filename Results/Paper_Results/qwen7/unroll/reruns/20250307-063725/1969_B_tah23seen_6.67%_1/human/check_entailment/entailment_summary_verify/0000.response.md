### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why the program does not correctly solve the problem and why the provided function summary does not align with the requirements of the problem.

1. **Problem Requirements**:
   - We need to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - Each cyclic shift has a cost equal to the length of the substring being shifted.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to swap characters directly without considering the cyclic nature of the shifts.
   - It iterates through the string and performs swaps when it encounters a '0' followed by a '1'.
   - However, this approach does not account for the optimal sequence of shifts that minimizes the total cost.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the input string `101011`.
     - The optimal solution involves two cyclic shifts:
       1. Shift the substring `[1, 3]`: `101011 -> 010111` (cost = 3).
       2. Shift the substring `[2, 6]`: `010111 -> 001111` (cost = 5).
     - Total cost = 3 + 5 = 8.
   - The program, however, incorrectly calculates the cost as 9.

4. **Program Behavior**:
   - The program iterates through the string and performs direct swaps when it finds a '0' followed by a '1'.
   - This approach does not consider the cyclic nature of the shifts and thus does not find the optimal solution.

5. **Function Summary Validation**:
   - The function summary states that the function counts the necessary swaps to rearrange the string so that all '1's appear before all '0's.
   - However, this summary does not reflect the actual behavior of the function, which does not account for the cyclic shifts and thus does not solve the problem correctly.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
