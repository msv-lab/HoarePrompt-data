Output State: **`s` is a list containing all characters from `sChar`, `sChar` remains unchanged, `left` is 0, `cost` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `sChar`, or `left`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and only `cost` is updated to 0.
