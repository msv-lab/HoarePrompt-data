Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly defines the function `func_1` which aims to convert a binary string into a sorted form (all '1's before all '0's) with minimal cost.
2. The logic within the function is sound:
   - It iterates through the string to find the first '0' and '1' to swap them.
   - It then continues to find subsequent '0's and '1's to swap, accumulating the cost of each swap.
   - The cost is calculated as the distance between the positions of the '1' and '0' being swapped.
3. The function correctly handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.
4. The provided example test cases match the expected behavior of the function.

Given the analysis, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
