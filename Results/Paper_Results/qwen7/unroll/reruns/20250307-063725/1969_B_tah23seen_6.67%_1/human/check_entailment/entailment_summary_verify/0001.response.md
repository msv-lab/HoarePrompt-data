### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function converts the string `sChar` into a list `s` for easier manipulation. This step is necessary but not strictly required since strings in Python are immutable, and converting them to a list allows for in-place modifications.
   - It initializes `left` and `right` pointers and a `cost` variable to keep track of the total cost.
   - The main logic involves moving the `left` and `right` pointers to find positions where a swap would help in sorting the string.
   - When a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1', a swap is performed, and the cost is updated.
   - The `while` loops ensure that the pointers move through the string until they reach the end.

3. **Swapping Mechanism**:
   - The swapping mechanism is implemented correctly. When a '0' is found at a position greater than a '1', the elements at `left` and `right` are swapped, and the cost is incremented by `right - left + 1`.
   - However, the swapping mechanism does not account for the fact that a cyclic shift is required to move the '0' to the front of the '1's. The current implementation only performs in-place swaps within the list, which does not reflect the actual operation of a cyclic shift.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles cases where the string is already sorted (`0000` in the example) correctly by returning `0`.
   - The function also handles cases where no swaps are needed, which is also correctly handled by returning `0`.

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The cost calculation is done correctly by adding the length of the substring being swapped each time a swap is made. However, this cost calculation is not reflective of the actual cost of performing a cyclic shift.

6. **Output**:
   - The program prints the cost for each test case, which is correct according to the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the cyclic shift operation required by the problem. The function `func_1` only performs in-place swaps, which does not match the problem's requirement of cyclic shifts.

### Correctness:
**False**
