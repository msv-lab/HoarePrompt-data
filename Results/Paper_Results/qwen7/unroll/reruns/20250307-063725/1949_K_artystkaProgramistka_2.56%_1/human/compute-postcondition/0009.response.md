Postcondition: **`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c` are the sums of the largest `na`, `nb`, `nc` elements from the original `numbers` list; `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are lists containing the first `na`, `nb`, `nc` elements from the `numbers` list in their original order; `numbers` is an empty list since all elements have been distributed; `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` retain their initial values; the function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` returns False**
