The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, representing the total number of elements, and the sizes of three groups, respectively. It also takes a list `numbers` containing `n` positive integers. The function sorts the `numbers` list in descending order and then distributes the elements into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) based on their original order. After distribution, it calculates the sum of elements in each group. If the function `func_1` returns true when given the sums of these groups, it returns 'YES' along with the three groups. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
