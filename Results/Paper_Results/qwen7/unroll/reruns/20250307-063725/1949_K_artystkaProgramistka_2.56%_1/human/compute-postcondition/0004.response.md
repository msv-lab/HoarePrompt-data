Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head**: The loop head is `for num in numbers:`. This means the loop variable is `num` and it iterates over each element in the list `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `num`: This is the variable that will take on the value of each element in the list `numbers` during each iteration.
   - `numbers`: This is the list being iterated over.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `num` takes on the value of each element in `numbers` during each iteration, we need to ensure that `numbers` is properly defined and contains the correct elements.
   - The initial state of `numbers` is given as a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order before the loop starts. The other variables (`sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the list `numbers`.

**State:**
**`numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order**
