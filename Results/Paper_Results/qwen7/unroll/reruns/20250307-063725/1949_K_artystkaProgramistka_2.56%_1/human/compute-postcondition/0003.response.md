Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for num in numbers:`. The objects involved here are `num` and `numbers`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is the variable that will take on each value from the `numbers` list during each iteration of the loop.
   - `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

3. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - The loop will iterate over each element in the `numbers` list exactly once.
   - The first value of `num` will be the largest number in the `numbers` list (since `numbers` is sorted in descending order).

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop will start with the largest number in the `numbers` list, we need to ensure that `num` is set to the first (largest) element of `numbers`.
   - The list `numbers` itself remains unchanged as it is the source of values for `num`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `num` should be the largest number in the `numbers` list.
- `numbers` should remain a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: `num` is the largest number in the `numbers` list, `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order**.
