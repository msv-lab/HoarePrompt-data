Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 200,000 inclusive, and `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers between 1 and `n-2` inclusive with the condition that `na + nb + nc = n`. It also accepts a list `numbers` containing `n` positive integers each between 1 and \(10^9\). The function returns 'YES' along with three groups of integers (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to partition the list `numbers` into three groups such that the sum of integers in each group is equal; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.**
