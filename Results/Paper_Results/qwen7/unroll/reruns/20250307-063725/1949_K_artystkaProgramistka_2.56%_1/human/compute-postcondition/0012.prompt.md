You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, na, nb, and nc are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2 and na + nb + nc = n, and numbers is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ numbers[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: Output State: `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c` are the sums of the elements in `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` respectively; `group_a`, `group_b`, `group_c` are lists containing the first `na`, `nb`, `nc` elements from the `numbers` list in their original order; `numbers` is an empty list since all elements have been distributed; `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc` retain their initial values; `sum_a`, `sum_b`, `sum_c` are the sums of the largest `na`, `nb`, `nc` elements from the original `numbers` list.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: `n`, `na`, `nb`, and `nc`, where `n` is an integer between 3 and 200,000 inclusive, and `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers between 1 and `n-2` inclusive with the condition that `na + nb + nc = n`. It also accepts a list `numbers` containing `n` positive integers each between 1 and \(10^9\). The function returns 'YES' along with three groups of integers (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to partition the list `numbers` into three groups such that the sum of integers in each group is equal; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
