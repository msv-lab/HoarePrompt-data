Output State: **`sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` are initialized to 0; `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, and `nc` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `nc` ≤ `n`-2; `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers such that 1 ≤ `numbers[i]` ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < `n`; `numbers` is sorted in descending order; `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are empty lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes three variables `sum_a`, `sum_b`, and `sum_c` to 0. The values of `n`, `na`, `nb`, `nc`, `numbers`, and the lists `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` remain unchanged from their initial states.
