Output State: **The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c**

This means the program returns a tuple containing the string `'YES'` and three lists: `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`. These lists contain the first `na`, `nb`, and `nc` elements from the original `numbers` list in their original order, respectively. The function `func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c)` also evaluates to `True`, but this information is not part of the return value itself.
