The function accepts three parameters \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), which are positive integers such that \(a + b + c = n\), where \(n\) is the total number of integers to split into three groups, and \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq n-2\). It returns True if the conditions \(a + b > c\), \(a + c > b\), and \(b + c > a\) are all satisfied.
