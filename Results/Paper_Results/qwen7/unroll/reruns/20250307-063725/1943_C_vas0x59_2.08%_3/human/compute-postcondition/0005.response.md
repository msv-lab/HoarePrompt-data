Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing two elements: one for each directed edge connected to the corresponding index, `d` is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `_` is the second return value from BFS which is not used.**

Explanation: The code `d, _ = bfs(0)` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 0. The BFS function returns two values: the distance (`d`) from node 0 to all other nodes and an unused value (`_`). The distances are stored in the variable `d`. The initial conditions of `n` and `u2vs` remain unchanged.
