Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order, and its length is odd; `ci` is the integer value of half the length of `path_ba`, rounded down.**

Explanation: The code calculates the value of `ci` as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2, which means `ci` is the floor of the length of `path_ba` divided by 2. The length of `path_ba` is odd, so `ci` will be one less than half of the length of `path_ba`. The `ops` list remains empty as no operations were performed on it.
