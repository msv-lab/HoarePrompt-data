Postcondition: `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order, and `ops` is a list containing either tuples `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`, or the elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2); `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
