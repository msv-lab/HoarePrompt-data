Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order. Since the exact content of `path_ba` is not specified, let's denote it as a list with elements `[p1, p2, p3, ..., pn]` where `n` is the number of nodes in the path.

2. **`ops`**: This list contains two types of elements:
   - Tuples `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
   - Elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2), where `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

Given this, let's determine the structure of `ops`:
- `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`. If `path_ba` has `n` elements, then `c2 = n / 2`.
- `c1` is `c2 - 1`, so `c1 = n / 2 - 1`.
- The elements of `ops` include:
  - Tuples `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`.
  - Elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2).

To find the length of `ops`, we need to count both types of elements:
- The number of tuples `(c, i)` depends on the specific structure of `path_ba`, but generally, there will be multiple such tuples.
- The number of elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2) is determined by the range from `0` to `c2` with a step of 2, which gives us `c2 / 2 + 1` elements.

However, since the exact structure of `path_ba` is not provided, we can only determine the general form of `ops` and its length based on the given conditions.

Given the structure, the length of `ops` will be the sum of the number of tuples and the number of specific elements mentioned.

Since the exact number of tuples is not specified, we focus on the specific elements:
- The number of specific elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2) is `c2 / 2 + 1`.

Thus, the length of `ops` is approximately `c2 / 2 + 1`.

Given `c2 = n / 2`, the length of `ops` is:
\[ \text{Length of } ops = \frac{n}{2} / 2 + 1 = \frac{n}{4} + 1 \]

Therefore, the output will be the length of `ops`, which is `n / 4 + 1`.

Output: **n / 4 + 1 (where n is the number of elements in path_ba)**
