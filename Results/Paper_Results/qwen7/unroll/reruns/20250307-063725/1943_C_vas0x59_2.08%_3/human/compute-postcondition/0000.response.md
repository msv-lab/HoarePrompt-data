Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The length of the list `u2vs` remains unchanged, and it still contains `n` elements, each of which is a list of integers representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex. The initial state of `u2vs` is preserved, and only `n` is updated to the input integer value.
