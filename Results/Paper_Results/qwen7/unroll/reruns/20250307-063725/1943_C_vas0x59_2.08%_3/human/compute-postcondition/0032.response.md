Functionality: **The function processes an undirected graph represented by an integer `n` and a list `u2vs`. It performs a breadth-first search (BFS) twice to find the shortest path from node 0 to another node, constructs a list of operations based on the path, and prints the count of operations followed by the operations themselves. The function does not return any value.**
