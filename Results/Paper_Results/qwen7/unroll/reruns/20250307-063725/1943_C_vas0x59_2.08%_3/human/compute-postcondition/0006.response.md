Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing two elements: one for each directed edge connected to the corresponding index, `d` is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS, `a` is the return value from `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The line `a = func_1(d)` calls the function `func_1` with the parameter `d`, which is the distance from node 0 to all other nodes using BFS. The function `func_1` returns a value, which is assigned to the variable `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
