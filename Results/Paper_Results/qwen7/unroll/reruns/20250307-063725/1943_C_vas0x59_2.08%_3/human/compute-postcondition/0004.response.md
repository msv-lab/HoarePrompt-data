Output State: `n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing two elements: one for each directed edge connected to the corresponding index. The lists represent an undirected graph where `u2vs[u].append(v)` and `u2vs[v].append(u)` add a bidirectional edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
