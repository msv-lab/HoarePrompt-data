Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing two elements: one for each directed edge connected to the corresponding index, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0 using the distance array `a`, `previous` is the array keeping track of the previous node in the shortest path for each node, `a` is the return value from `func_1(d)`**.

In this output state, the BFS algorithm has been run starting from node 0 using the distance array `a` which was the return value from `func_1(d)`. The variable `d` now contains the shortest distances from node 0 to all other nodes, and `previous` keeps track of the previous node in the shortest path for each node. The initial values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `a` remain unchanged.
