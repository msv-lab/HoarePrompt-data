Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing two elements: one for each directed edge connected to the corresponding index, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0 using the distance array `a`, `previous` is the array keeping track of the previous node in the shortest path for each node, `b` is the return value from `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0 using the distance array `a`, and `previous` is the array keeping track of the previous node in the shortest path for each node, these values remain unchanged. The only new variable introduced is `b`, which now holds the return value of `func_1(d)`.
