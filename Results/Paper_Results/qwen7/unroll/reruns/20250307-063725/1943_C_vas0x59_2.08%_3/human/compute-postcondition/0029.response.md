Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

### Initial State Breakdown:
1. **`path_ba`**: This is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order.
2. **`ops`**: This is a list containing either tuples `(c, i)` where `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), and `c` is the element at index `ci` in `path_ba`, or the elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2).

   - `c2` is half the length of `path_ba` and `c1` is `c2 - 1`.

### Code Snippet Analysis:
```python
print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
```

This line of code maps over the `ops` list and formats each tuple `(c, i)` into a string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'`, which adds 1 to the first element of the tuple and then prints these strings separated by newlines.

### Detailed Explanation:
- For each tuple `(c, i)` in `ops`:
  - `c` is an element from `path_ba` at index `ci`.
  - The string `f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}'` will be formatted as `f'{c + 1} {i}'`.
  - Since `i` ranges from `0` to `ci` (inclusive), it will print lines like `c + 1 i` for each valid `i`.

- For the special elements (0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5), ..., (c2, len(path_ba) - c1 - 2):
  - These elements are directly included in the `ops` list and will be processed similarly.

### Example Calculation:
Assume `path_ba = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` (for simplicity, let's assume this is the shortest path in reverse order).

- `c2` would be half the length of `path_ba`, so `c2 = 2` and `c1 = 1`.
- The `ops` list could look like:
  - Tuples: `[(5, 0), (4, 1), (3, 2), (2, 3), (1, 4)]`
  - Special elements: `(0, 1), (0, 3), (0, 5)`

### Formatted Output:
- For the tuples:
  - `(5, 0)` -> `6 0`
  - `(4, 1)` -> `5 1`
  - `(3, 2)` -> `4 2`
  - `(2, 3)` -> `3 3`
  - `(1, 4)` -> `2 4`

- For the special elements:
  - `(0, 1)` -> `1 1`
  - `(0, 3)` -> `1 3`
  - `(0, 5)` -> `1 5`

### Final Output:
Output: **6 0
5 1
4 2
3 3
2 4
1 1
1 3
1 5**
