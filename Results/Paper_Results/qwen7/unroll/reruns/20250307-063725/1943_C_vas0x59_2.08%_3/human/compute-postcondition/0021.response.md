Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order, and `ops` is an empty list; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `c2` as the integer division of the length of `path_ba` by 2. Since the length of `path_ba` is even, `c2` will be an integer representing half the length of `path_ba`. The states of `path_ba` and `ops` remain unchanged.
