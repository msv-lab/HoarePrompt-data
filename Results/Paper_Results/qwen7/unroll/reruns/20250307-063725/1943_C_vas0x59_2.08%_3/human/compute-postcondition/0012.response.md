Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order.

Explanation: The loop continues to append nodes to `path_ba` until it reaches a node with no previous node (`-1`), indicating the start of the path (node 0). Since the loop appends nodes in reverse order, `path_ba` will contain the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b`, but in reverse order.
