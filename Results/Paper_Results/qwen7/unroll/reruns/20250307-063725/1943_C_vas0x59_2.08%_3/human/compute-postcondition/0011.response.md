Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to node `path_ba[-1]` (which is the last node in the path before reaching a node with no previous node), and all intermediate nodes in the path.

Explanation: The loop continues to append the previous node to `path_ba` until it reaches a node with no previous node (`n == -1`). This indicates that the shortest path from node 0 has been fully traced back to its start. The final `path_ba` list thus represents the shortest path from node 0 to the farthest node reachable, with each element being a node in the path in reverse order (from the end node to node 0).
