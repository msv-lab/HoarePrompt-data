Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of length `n` where each element is a list containing two elements: one for each directed edge connected to the corresponding index, `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0 using the distance array `a`, `previous` is the array keeping track of the previous node in the shortest path for each node, `b` is the return value from `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a new list `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. The values of `n`, `u2vs`, `d`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
