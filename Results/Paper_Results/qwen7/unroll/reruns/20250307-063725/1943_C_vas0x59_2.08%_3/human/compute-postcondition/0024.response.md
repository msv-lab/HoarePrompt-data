Output State: `path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order, `ops` is a list containing the tuples `(c1, i)` and `(c2, i)` for every odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(path_ba) - c1 - 1`, with a step of 2, and `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is `c2 - 1`.
