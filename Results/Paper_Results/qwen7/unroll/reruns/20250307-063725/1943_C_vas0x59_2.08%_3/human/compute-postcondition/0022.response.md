Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order, and `ops` is an empty list; `c2` is half the length of `path_ba`; `c1` is `c2 - 1`.**

Explanation: The code sets `c1` to `c2 - 1`. Since `c2` is defined as half the length of `path_ba`, `c1` is now set to half the length of `path_ba` minus one. The other variables remain unchanged.
