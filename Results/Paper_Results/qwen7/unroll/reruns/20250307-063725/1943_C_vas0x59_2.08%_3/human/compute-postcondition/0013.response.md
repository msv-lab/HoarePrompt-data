Output State: **`path_ba` is a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order, and `ops` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ops`. This operation does not affect the value of `path_ba`, which remains as a list containing the shortest path from node 0 to the node pointed by `b` in reverse order. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the empty list `ops`.
