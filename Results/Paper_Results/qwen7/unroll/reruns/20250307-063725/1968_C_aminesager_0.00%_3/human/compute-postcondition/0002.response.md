Output State: The output will be a series of lists, each representing the transformed list `a` for each input `n` and its corresponding sequence `T`.

Explanation: For each input `n`, the program reads `n` integers from the user, which form the list `T`. It then constructs a list `a` where each element is calculated based on the previous element minus the corresponding element in `T`. After processing all elements, the list `a` is reversed and printed. This process repeats for each value of `t` until `t` becomes zero. Therefore, the output will contain `t` such lists, each corresponding to one iteration of the loop.
