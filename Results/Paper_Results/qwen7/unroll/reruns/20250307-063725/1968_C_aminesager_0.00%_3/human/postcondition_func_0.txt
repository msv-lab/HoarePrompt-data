The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the sequence minus one), and a list `T` of `n-1` integers. It constructs a list `a` starting with 1000 and iteratively updates it based on the values in `T`. After processing all elements in `T`, it reverses the list `a` and prints it. The function outputs a series of transformed sequences `a`, one for each test case.
