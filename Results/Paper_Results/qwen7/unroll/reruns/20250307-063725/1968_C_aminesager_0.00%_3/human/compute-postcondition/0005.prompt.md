You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        t = t - 1
        
        n = int(input())
        
        line = input('')
        
        T = list(map(int, line.split()))
        
        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]
        
        result = ' '.join(map(str, a))
        
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of lists, each representing the transformed sequence `a` for each input integer `n` provided by the user. Each list `a` is constructed such that `a[i] = 1000 - Σ(T[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`, where `T` is the list of integers inputted for each `n`. The final list `a` for each iteration is reversed before being printed.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- For each value of `t`, the user inputs an integer `n`.
    #- Then, the user inputs a line of space-separated integers, which are split into a list `T`.
    #- A list `a` is initialized with `[1000]`.
    #- For each index `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
    #- After the loop completes for each `n`, the list `a` is reversed.
    #- The reversed list `a` is then joined into a string and printed.
    #
    #The output state will consist of these printed strings, one for each input `n`, showing the transformed list `a` for each respective `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of n-1 integers (where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). It does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
