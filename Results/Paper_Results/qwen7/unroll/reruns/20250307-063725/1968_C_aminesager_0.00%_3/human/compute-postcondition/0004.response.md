Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 500), and a list `x` of n-1 integers (where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n). It does not return any value explicitly mentioned in the provided information.**

This means the function likely processes multiple test cases defined by the parameters `t`, `n`, and `x` for each case, but the specific operations to be performed are not detailed in the given information.
