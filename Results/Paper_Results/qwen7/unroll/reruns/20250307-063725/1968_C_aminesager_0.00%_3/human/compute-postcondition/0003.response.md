Output State: The output state will be a series of lists, each representing the transformed sequence `a` for each input integer `n` provided by the user. Each list `a` is constructed such that `a[i] = 1000 - Î£(T[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`, where `T` is the list of integers inputted for each `n`. The final list `a` for each iteration is reversed before being printed.

To break it down further:
- For each value of `t`, the user inputs an integer `n`.
- Then, the user inputs a line of space-separated integers, which are split into a list `T`.
- A list `a` is initialized with `[1000]`.
- For each index `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
- After the loop completes for each `n`, the list `a` is reversed.
- The reversed list `a` is then joined into a string and printed.

The output state will consist of these printed strings, one for each input `n`, showing the transformed list `a` for each respective `n`.
