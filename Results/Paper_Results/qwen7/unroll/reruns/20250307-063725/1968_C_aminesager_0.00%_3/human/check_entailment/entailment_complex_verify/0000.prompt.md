You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

        a = [1000]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            a.append(a[i - 1] - T[i - 1])
        
        a = a[::-1]

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of lists, each representing the transformed sequence `a` for each input integer `n` provided by the user. Each list `a` is constructed such that `a[i] = 1000 - Σ(T[j])` for `j` from `0` to `i-1`, where `T` is the list of integers inputted for each `n`. The final list `a` for each iteration is reversed before being printed.
    #
    #To break it down further:
    #- For each value of `t`, the user inputs an integer `n`.
    #- Then, the user inputs a line of space-separated integers, which are split into a list `T`.
    #- A list `a` is initialized with `[1000]`.
    #- For each index `i` from `1` to `n-1`, `a[i]` is calculated as `a[i-1] - T[i-1]`.
    #- After the loop completes for each `n`, the list `a` is reversed.
    #- The reversed list `a` is then joined into a string and printed.
    #
    #The output state will consist of these printed strings, one for each input `n`, showing the transformed list `a` for each respective `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the sequence minus one), and a list `T` of `n-1` integers. It constructs a list `a` starting with 1000 and iteratively updates it based on the values in `T`. After processing all elements in `T`, it reverses the list `a` and prints it. The function outputs a series of transformed sequences `a`, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all potential cases. Specifically, the program attempts to generate `a` in reverse order, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence meets the required modulo conditions.

Let's consider a specific example to demonstrate the issue:

For the input:
```
4
2 4 1
```
The expected output should be an array `a` such that:
- \(a_2 \bmod a_1 = 2 \bmod a_1 = 2\)
- \(a_3 \bmod a_2 = 4 \bmod a_2 = 4\)
- \(a_4 \bmod a_3 = 1 \bmod a_3 = 1\)

The program generates:
```
a = [1000, 998, 994, 993]
```
However, this does not satisfy the conditions:
- \(998 \bmod 1000 = 998\) (should be 2)
- \(994 \bmod 998 = 994\) (should be 4)
- \(993 \bmod 994 = 993\) (should be 1)

Therefore, the program fails to produce a valid sequence for this input, indicating that it is not correct for all potential cases.
