Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is the input integer from the user; other variables (`n` and `x`) are not yet defined.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the input is read from the user, the exact value of `t` is not specified here, but it is known to be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Variables `n` and `x` remain undefined after this line of code.
