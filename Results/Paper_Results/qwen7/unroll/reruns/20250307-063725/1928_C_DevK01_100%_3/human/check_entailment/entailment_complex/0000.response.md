Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values for \( k \) given \( n \) and \( x \), where \( n \) is Vasya's position in the line and \( x \) is the number he received during the settling process. The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and the number \( x \) must fit into the repeating pattern.
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to find all possible values of \( k \) that satisfy the given conditions.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The main logic is in the `func_1` function.
   - The function calculates potential values of \( k \) by finding divisors of \( q = \frac{y-2}{2} \) where \( y = n + x \).
   - The condition \( w \geq x - 1 \) ensures that the divisor is within the valid range for \( k \).

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function correctly identifies potential values of \( k \) by checking divisors of \( q \).
   - The logic to add divisors and their corresponding pairs (if they meet the condition) is correct.
   - The final step of converting the list to a set and returning its length is also correct.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop correctly processes each test case.
   - The condition checks whether \( y \) is even and handles the case when it is odd by printing 0 immediately.

Given the analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. There are no logical errors or omissions that would make the program incorrect.

Correctness: **True**
