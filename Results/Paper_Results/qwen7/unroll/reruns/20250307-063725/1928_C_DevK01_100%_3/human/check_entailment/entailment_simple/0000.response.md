Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `x`.
2. **Calculation of `y`**: The variable `y` is calculated as `n + x`, which is used to check if `y` is even. If `y` is odd, the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This part is correct.
3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` to get a list of potential values for `k`. It then checks if `n >= 3 * x - 2` and adds more values from another call to `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` if true. The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.
4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds `w` to the list `M`.
   - It then iterates through all divisors of `q` less than `w` and adds them to `M` if they are greater than or equal to `x - 1` and their corresponding quotient (when dividing `q` by the divisor) is also greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The function returns the list `M`.

Given the problem statement and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly identifies the possible values of `k` based on the conditions provided. The function `func_1` correctly computes the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` that meet the criteria.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
