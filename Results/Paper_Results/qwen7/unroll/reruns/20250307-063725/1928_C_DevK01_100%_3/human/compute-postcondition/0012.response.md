Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds this value to the list `M`. Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `q`, checking if they are divisors of `q` and if they or their corresponding divisors (i.e., `q // i`) are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If these conditions are met, the respective values are added to the list `M`. Finally, the function returns an empty list `M`.**
