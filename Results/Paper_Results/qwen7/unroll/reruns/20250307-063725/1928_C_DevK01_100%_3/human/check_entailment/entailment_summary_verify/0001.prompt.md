You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
In a well-known school, a physical education lesson took place. As usual,
everyone was lined up and asked to settle in "the first–k -th" position.

As is known, settling in "the first–k -th" position occurs as follows: the
first k people have numbers 1, 2, 3, \ldots, k , the next k - 2 people have
numbers k - 1, k - 2, \ldots, 2 , the next k people have numbers 1, 2, 3,
\ldots, k , and so on. Thus, the settling repeats every 2k - 2 positions.
Examples of settling are given in the "Note" section.

The boy Vasya constantly forgets everything. For example, he forgot the number
k described above. But he remembers the position he occupied in the line, as
well as the number he received during the settling. Help Vasya understand how
many natural numbers k fit under the given constraints.

Note that the settling exists if and only if k > 1 . In particular, this means
that the settling does not exist for k = 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x < n \le
10^9 ) — Vasya's position in the line and the number Vasya received during the
settling.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of different k that
fit under the given constraints.

It can be proven that under the given constraints, the answer is finite.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10 2
    
    3 1
    
    76 4
    
    100 99
    
    1000000000 500000000

Output

    4
    1
    9
    0
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, k equals 2, 3, 5, 6 are suitable.

An example of settling for these k :

k / №| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 1 | 2   
3 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
5 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 2   
6 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2   
  
In the second test case, k = 2 is suitable.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    L = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n = L[0]
    x = L[1]
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)
        if n >= 3 * x - 2:
            L1 += func_1((n - x) // 2, x)
        L1 = list(set(L1))
        print(len(L1))
        continue

def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
        M += [w]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. It calculates the square root of `q` and checks if it is an integer greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If so, it adds this value to the list `M`. Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `q`, checking if they are divisors of `q` and if they or their corresponding divisors (i.e., `q // i`) are greater than or equal to `x - 1`. If these conditions are met, the respective values are added to the list `M`. Finally, the function returns an empty list `M`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is correct based on the problem statement.

3. **Check if `y` is even:**
   - If `y % 2 != 0`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct:
     - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
     - It then iterates through possible divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the criteria.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - `L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the divisors of `((n - x) // 2)` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to `L1`.
   - The result is converted to a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.

### Verification:

- The main logic correctly identifies the possible values of `k` by finding divisors of specific values derived from `n` and `x`.
- The function `func_1` correctly finds all relevant divisors.
- The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the program appears to be correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
