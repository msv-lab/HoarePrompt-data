Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `i < w`.
2. **Determine the current state**:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `q` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
   - `w` is the square root of `q`.
   - `M` is a list containing `w` if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is an empty list.

3. **Check the loop condition**: For the loop to execute the first time, `i` (which is 1) must be less than `w`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is already 1, we need to ensure that `w` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - The value of `w` is the square root of `q`, so `q` must be at least 5 (since the square root of 4 is 2, but we need `w` to be greater than 1).

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `q` must be at least 5.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `q` is an integer representing the number of test cases and `q` must be at least 5, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `M` is a list containing `w` if `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`, otherwise `M` is an empty list**.
