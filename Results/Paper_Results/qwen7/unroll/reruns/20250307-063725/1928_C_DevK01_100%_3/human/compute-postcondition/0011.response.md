Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `q` and `x`. `q` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9. The function returns an empty list M.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, where each test case involves two integers `x` and `n`. However, the function itself does not perform any operations on `x` and `n` but simply returns an empty list regardless of the input values.
