Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the number of valid `k` values. Specifically, the function `func_1` is not used correctly and does not handle the logic as required by the problem description.

Here is a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `func_1`**: The function `func_1` is intended to generate a list of possible values for `k`, but its implementation is flawed. It checks whether `q` is a perfect square and adds the square root to the list if it is greater than or equal to `x-1`. However, it also incorrectly adds divisors of `q` without proper conditions.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `L1`**: The calculation of `L1` in the main loop is not correct. It should consider the range of `k` values based on the position `n` and the number `x` received by Vasya. The current implementation does not properly account for the periodicity of the settling pattern.

3. **Missing Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases such as when `n` is very close to `2k-2` or when `x` is near the boundaries of the settling pattern.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
10 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
4
```

**Actual Output:**
```
0
```

The program fails to correctly identify the valid `k` values for this case. The correct `k` values should be 2, 3, 5, and 6, but the program returns 0.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
