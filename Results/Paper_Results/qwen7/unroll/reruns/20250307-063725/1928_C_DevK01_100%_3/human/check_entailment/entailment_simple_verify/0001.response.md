### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n` and `x`.

#### Calculation of `y`:
- `y = n + x` is calculated, which is correct based on the problem statement.

#### Check if `y` is even:
- If `y % 2 != 0`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- The logic in `func_1` is correct:
  - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It then iterates through possible divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the criteria.

#### Main Logic:
- `L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the divisors of `((n - x) // 2)` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to `L1`.
- The result is converted to a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Function `func_1(q, x)`**:
   - The function aims to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic is correct, but there is a potential issue with the condition `w == w // 1`. This condition will always be true because `w // 1` is an integer and `w` itself is also an integer. Therefore, the check `w == w // 1` is redundant and can be removed.
   - The function should simply check if `w >= x - 1` directly.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The calculation of `y = n + x` is correct.
   - The check `if y % 2 != 0` ensures that `y` is even, which is necessary for the settling pattern.
   - The function calls `func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` and `func_1((n - x) // 2, x)` to find the appropriate divisors.
   - The logic for adding these divisors to `L1` is correct.
   - Converting `L1` to a set removes duplicates, and printing the length of the set gives the number of valid `k` values.

### Corrected Function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(q, x):
    M = []
    w = math.sqrt(q)
    if w >= x - 1:
        M += [int(w)]
    i = 1
    while i < w:
        if q % i == 0:
            if i >= x - 1:
                M += [i]
            if q // i >= x - 1:
                M += [q // i]
        i += 1
    return M
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is mostly correct, but there is a minor issue with the redundant condition in the function `func_1`. After removing the redundant condition, the program should still work correctly.

Correctness: **True**
