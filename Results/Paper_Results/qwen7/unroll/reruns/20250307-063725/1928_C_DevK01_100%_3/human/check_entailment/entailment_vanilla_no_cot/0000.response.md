Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is called with parameters that do not match its definition. Specifically, the function is called with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, but the function expects parameters `q` and `x`. The variable `q` should be calculated correctly based on the problem statement.

2. **Calculation of `q`**: The calculation of `q` in the `func_1` call is incorrect. According to the problem, `q` should be calculated as `(n - x) // 2` instead of `(y - 2) // 2`.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `n` is very close to `x` or when `x` is very large relative to `n`.

4. **Set Operations**: The use of `set` to remove duplicates is unnecessary and can be simplified.

5. **Logic Flaws**: The logic for determining the valid values of `k` is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the repeating pattern of the settling process.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, x = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    y = n + x
    if y % 2 != 0:
        print(0)
        continue
    else:
        q = (n - x) // 2
        M = []
        w = math.sqrt(q)
        if w == w // 1 and w >= x - 1:
            M.append(w)
        i = 1
        while i <= w:
            if q % i == 0:
                if i >= x - 1:
                    M.append(i)
                if q // i >= x - 1:
                    M.append(q // i)
            i += 1
        M = list(set(M))
        print(len(M))
```

This corrected version ensures that the calculations are done correctly and handles the logic for determining valid values of `k` appropriately.
