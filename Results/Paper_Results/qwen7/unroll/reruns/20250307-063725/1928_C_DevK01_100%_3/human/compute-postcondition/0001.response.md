Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `w` is the square root of `q`, and `M` is an empty list.**

The code calculates `w` as the square root of `q`. Since `q` is an integer, `w` will be the mathematical square root of `q`. The states of the other variables (`x`, `n`, and `M`) remain unchanged.
