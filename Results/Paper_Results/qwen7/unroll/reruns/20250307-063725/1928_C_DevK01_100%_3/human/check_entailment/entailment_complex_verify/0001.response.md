### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is correct based on the problem statement.

3. **Check if `y` is even:**
   - If `y % 2 != 0`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct:
     - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
     - It then iterates through possible divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the criteria.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - `L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the divisors of `((n - x) // 2)` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to `L1`.
   - The result is converted to a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - The function aims to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - However, the function always returns an empty list `M`. This is because the condition `w == w // 1` is always true for any integer `w`, but the subsequent checks `w >= x - 1` are not being properly evaluated.
  - Specifically, the function should return divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`, but it never actually adds any divisors to `M`.

- **Main Logic:**
  - The main logic relies on the results of `func_1`, which is always returning an empty list.
  - Therefore, `L1` will always be an empty list, and the length of `L1` will always be `0`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's walk through the example given in the problem statement:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `10 2`
  - `y = 10 + 2 = 12`
  - `y % 2 == 0`, so we proceed.
  - `L1 = func_1((12 - 2) // 2, 2) = func_1(5, 2)`
  - `func_1(5, 2)` returns an empty list because there are no divisors of 5 that are greater than or equal to 1.
  - Since `n >= 3 * x - 2` is false (`10 < 3 * 2 - 2 = 4`), no additional divisors are added.
  - Output: `0` (which is incorrect)

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `3 1`
  - `y = 3 + 1 = 4`
  - `y % 2 == 0`, so we proceed.
  - `L1 = func_1((4 - 2) // 2, 1) = func_1(1, 1)`
  - `func_1(1, 1)` returns an empty list because there are no divisors of 1 that are greater than or equal to 0.
  - Since `n >= 3 * x - 2` is false (`3 < 3 * 1 - 2 = 1`), no additional divisors are added.
  - Output: `0` (which is incorrect)

### Conclusion:

The program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is not properly implemented to find the required divisors. It always returns an empty list, leading to incorrect outputs.
