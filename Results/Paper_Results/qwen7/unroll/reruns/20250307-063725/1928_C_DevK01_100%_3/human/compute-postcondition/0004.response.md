Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `w` is the square root of `q`, `M` is a list containing `w`, and `w` is an integer and greater than or equal to `x - 1`.**

Explanation: The line `M += [w]` appends the value of `w` to the list `M`. Since `w` is already defined as the square root of `q`, appending `w` to `M` means `M` now contains `w`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
