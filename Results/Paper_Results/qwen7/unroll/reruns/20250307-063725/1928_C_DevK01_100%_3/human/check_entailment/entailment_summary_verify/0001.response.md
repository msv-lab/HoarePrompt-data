### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided function summary.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
- It then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n` and `x`.

#### Calculation of `y`:
- `y = n + x` is calculated, which is correct based on the problem statement.

#### Check if `y` is even:
- If `y % 2 != 0`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- The logic in `func_1` is correct:
  - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
  - It then iterates through possible divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the criteria.

#### Main Logic:
- `L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
- If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the divisors of `((n - x) // 2)` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to `L1`.
- The result is converted to a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly identifies all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic for finding divisors is sound and ensures that all relevant divisors are considered.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The expression `(y - 2) // 2` calculates the number of complete cycles of the settling pattern that fit into `y - 2` positions.
   - The condition `n >= 3 * x - 2` ensures that we consider the additional positions beyond the first cycle.
   - Adding the results of `func_1` for both expressions ensures that all possible values of `k` are considered.

3. **Set Conversion:**
   - Converting the list to a set removes any duplicate values, ensuring that each valid `k` is counted only once.

4. **Output:**
   - The length of the set is printed, giving the number of valid `k` values.

### Verification:

- The main logic correctly identifies the possible values of `k` by finding divisors of specific values derived from `n` and `x`.
- The function `func_1` correctly finds all relevant divisors.
- The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

After re-evaluating the code, the program appears to be correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.
