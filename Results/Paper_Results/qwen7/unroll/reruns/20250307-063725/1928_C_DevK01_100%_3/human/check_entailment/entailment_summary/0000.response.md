Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The settling pattern repeats every \( 2k - 2 \) positions.
   - The position \( n \) and number \( x \) must satisfy certain conditions related to \( k \).

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to find divisors of \( q \) that are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).
   - It checks if the square root of \( q \) is an integer and adds it to the list if it meets the condition.
   - It then iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of \( q \), checking if they are divisors of \( q \) and if they or their corresponding divisors are greater than or equal to \( x - 1 \).

4. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly calculates \( y = n + x \).
   - It checks if \( y \) is even; if not, it prints 0 and continues.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` with \( (y - 2) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - Depending on the position \( n \), it may call `func_1` again with \( (n - x) // 2 \) and \( x \).
   - The results are stored in a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.

5. **Validation**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies potential values of \( k \).
   - The main program correctly handles the conditions and prints the number of valid \( k \).

Given the execution summary and the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
