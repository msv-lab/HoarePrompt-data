Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values `n` and `x`.

2. **Calculation of `y`:**
   - `y = n + x` is calculated, which is correct based on the problem statement.

3. **Check if `y` is even:**
   - If `y % 2 != 0`, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This check is necessary because the settling pattern requires an even number of positions.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is defined to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct:
     - It checks if the square root of `q` is an integer and if it is greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
     - It then iterates through possible divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M` if they meet the criteria.

5. **Main Logic:**
   - `L1 = func_1((y - 2) // 2, x)` calculates the divisors of `(y - 2) // 2` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it adds the divisors of `((n - x) // 2)` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1` to `L1`.
   - The result is converted to a set to remove duplicates and the length of the set is printed.

### Verification:

- The main logic correctly identifies the possible values of `k` by finding divisors of specific values derived from `n` and `x`.
- The function `func_1` correctly finds all relevant divisors.
- The conditions and calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, the program appears to be correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.
