Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `while n:`. This means the loop will continue as long as `n` is non-zero (i.e., `n` is not equal to 0).

2. **Current state before the loop**: The current state is given as `n` is an input integer.

3. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be non-zero. Since `n` is described as an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is not zero for the loop to proceed.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `n` is non-zero. Therefore, we need to specify that `n` must be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be modified to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
