Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and we proceed to calculate `s` for each test case based on the input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer input for `n`. The initial state of `n` being decreased by 1 and the calculation of `s` for each test case using the provided formula are not directly affected by this line of code. The value of `n` is now set to the input integer, and the subsequent steps will involve calculating `s` for each test case based on this new value of `n`.
