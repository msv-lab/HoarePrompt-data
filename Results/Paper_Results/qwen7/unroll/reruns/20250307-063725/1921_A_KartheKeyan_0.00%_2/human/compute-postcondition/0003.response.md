Output State: The output state will be a series of floating-point numbers representing the calculated distances between two pairs of points from the four given points in each test case.

Explanation: For each test case, the code takes four pairs of coordinates as input, sorts them, and then calculates the distance between the first and second points and the third and fourth points. It then prints the product of the square roots of these distances. This process repeats for `n` test cases, resulting in `n` printed outputs, each being a floating-point number representing the calculated distance as described.
