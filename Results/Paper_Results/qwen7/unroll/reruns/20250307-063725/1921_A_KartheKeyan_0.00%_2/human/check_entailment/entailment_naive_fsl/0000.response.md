Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the area of the square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distance between two adjacent points. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated distance will represent the side length of the square. Specifically, the program may incorrectly assume that the distance between two diagonally opposite points represents the side length of the square.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
0 2
2 0
-1 -1
1 1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

Expected Output:
```
4
4
784
```

However, the program's output for the first test case would be incorrect because it calculates the distance between (0, 0) and (2, 2), which is the diagonal length of the square, not the side length. This leads to an incorrect area calculation.

A correct approach would involve identifying pairs of points that form horizontal or vertical sides of the square and then calculating the distance between these points to determine the side length.
