Functionality: **The function processes up to 100 test cases, where each test case consists of four integer coordinates (x_i, y_i) representing the corners of a square. It sorts these coordinates, calculates the Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and between the third and fourth points, and returns the absolute value of the product of these distances. The function outputs a series of floating-point numbers, each corresponding to the calculated distance product for each test case.**
