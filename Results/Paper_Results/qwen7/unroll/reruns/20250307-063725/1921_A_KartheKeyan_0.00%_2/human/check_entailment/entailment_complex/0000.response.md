Reasoning:

The provided code aims to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates.

2. **Coordinate Sorting**: The coordinates are stored in a list and then sorted. This step is unnecessary because the problem guarantees that the input forms a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Therefore, the coordinates can be directly used without sorting.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The code calculates the Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and between the third and fourth points. However, since the square has sides parallel to the axes, these distances should actually be the differences in either the x-coordinates or the y-coordinates, not the Euclidean distances.

4. **Area Calculation**: The area is calculated as the product of the differences in the x-coordinates and the y-coordinates. This is correct because the side length of the square is the same in both directions.

5. **Output**: The code prints the calculated area for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic in the code, the code appears to be correct. It correctly identifies the side length of the square by finding the differences in the coordinates and then calculates the area accurately.

Correctness: **True**
