You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of floating-point numbers, each representing the result of the calculation for the distance product between two pairs of points from the input coordinates for each test case.
    #
    #Each line of the output will contain one such result, and the total number of lines will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The calculation performed for each test case involves sorting the input coordinates, then computing the Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and between the third and fourth points, and finally taking the absolute value of the product of these two distances.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program attempts to calculate the area of the square by sorting the coordinates and then calculating the distance between two adjacent points. However, this approach does not guarantee that the calculated distance will represent the side length of the square. Specifically, the program may incorrectly assume that the distance between two diagonally opposite points represents the side length of the square.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
0 0
2 2
0 2
2 0
-1 -1
1 1
1 1
-1 -1
45 11
45 39
17 11
17 39
```

Expected Output:
```
4
4
784
```

However, the program's output for the first test case would be incorrect because it calculates the distance between (0, 0) and (2, 2), which is the diagonal length of the square, not the side length. This leads to an incorrect area calculation.

A correct approach would involve identifying pairs of points that form horizontal or vertical sides of the square and then calculating the distance between these points to determine the side length.
