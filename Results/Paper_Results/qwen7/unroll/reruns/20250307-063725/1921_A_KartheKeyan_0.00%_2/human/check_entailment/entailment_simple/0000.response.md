Reasoning:

The given program aims to calculate the area of a square by determining the side length using the distances between the coordinates of the corners. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and then processes each test case individually.

2. **Storing Coordinates**: It stores the coordinates of the four corners of the square in a list called `coord`.

3. **Sorting Coordinates**: The coordinates are sorted, which helps in identifying the correct pairs of points to compute the side length of the square.

4. **Calculating Distances**: 
   - It calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the first and second points (`p1`).
   - It calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the third and fourth points (`p2`).

5. **Determining Side Length**: The side length of the square is derived from the square roots of these distances. Since the square has sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the distances should be equal, and the side length is the square root of either `p1` or `p2`.

6. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as the product of the side lengths, but since itâ€™s a square, both distances should be the same, and thus the area is simply the square of one of these distances.

7. **Output**: The area is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly identify the side length of the square and compute the area accurately. The approach is sound and should work for all valid test cases within the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
