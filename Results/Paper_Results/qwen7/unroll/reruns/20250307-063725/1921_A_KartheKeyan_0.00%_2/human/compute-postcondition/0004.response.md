Output State: The output state will consist of a series of floating-point numbers, each representing the result of the calculation for the distance product between two pairs of points from the input coordinates for each test case.

Each line of the output will contain one such result, and the total number of lines will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The calculation performed for each test case involves sorting the input coordinates, then computing the Euclidean distances between the first and second points, and between the third and fourth points, and finally taking the absolute value of the product of these two distances.
