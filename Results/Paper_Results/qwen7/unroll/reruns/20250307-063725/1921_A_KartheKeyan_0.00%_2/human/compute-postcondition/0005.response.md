Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases, where each test case consists of four integers representing the coordinates (x_i, y_i) of the corners of a square. The function checks if the given coordinates form a valid square with a positive area and returns a specific value based on the validity of the square.**

Note: Since the function signature does not explicitly show any parameters, the description focuses on the implied input through test cases and the expected output based on the validation of the square's coordinates.
