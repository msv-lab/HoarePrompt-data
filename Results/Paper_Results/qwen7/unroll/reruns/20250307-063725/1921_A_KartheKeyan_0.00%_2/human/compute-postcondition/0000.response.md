Output State: **n is decreased by 1, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2` for each test case, and the value of `s` is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The code first reads an integer `n`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l//4))) // 2`, and prints the value of `s`. After processing all test cases, `n` is decreased by 1. The initial values of `x_i` and `y_i` are no longer relevant as they are not used in the code.
