Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of people in front (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
3. It then reads and stores the costs for swapping positions (`custo_pra_trocar_a`) and passing through positions (`custo_pra_passar_b`).
4. The program iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, calculating the minimum cost to reach a position within `pos_final`.
5. It updates the `best` cost to ensure that the minimum cost is tracked.
6. The logic for updating the `total` cost and the `best` cost is correct, considering both types of costs.
7. The program prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
