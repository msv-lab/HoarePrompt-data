### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It correctly extracts `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill).

2. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1 to match zero-based indexing, which is correct.

3. **Cost Arrays**:
   - The program correctly initializes and populates the cost arrays `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

4. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program iterates from `na_frente` to 0, which is correct since it starts from the last person in the queue and moves towards Kirill.
   - For each position `v`, it checks if moving Kirill to position `v` is beneficial compared to passing through intermediate positions.
   - The logic for updating `total` and `best` is correct:
     - If `v` is within the `pos_final` limit, it updates `best` and `total` based on the minimum cost between `custo_pra_trocar_a[v]` and `custo_pra_passar_b[v]`.
     - If `v` is beyond `pos_final`, it directly adds the appropriate cost to `total`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost stored in `best` for each test case, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The program handles the input, processes the costs, and calculates the minimum cost efficiently.

### Correctness:

**True**
