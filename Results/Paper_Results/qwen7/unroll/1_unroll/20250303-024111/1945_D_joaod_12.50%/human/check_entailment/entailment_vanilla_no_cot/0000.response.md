Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly reads the number of people in front (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`).
   - It reads the lists of costs (`custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`).

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - The variables `na_frente` and `pos_final` are adjusted by subtracting 1 to match zero-based indexing.

3. **Dynamic Programming Logic**:
   - The program iterates backward through the list of people from the last person to the first.
   - For each person, it checks if moving Kirill to that position would be cheaper than paying the cost of passing through intermediate positions.
   - It updates the `best` value to keep track of the minimum cost required to achieve the desired position.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - If moving Kirill to the current position is cheaper than passing through intermediate positions, it updates the `total` cost accordingly.
   - Otherwise, it adds the cost of passing through the intermediate positions.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the minimum cost (`best`) for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all scenarios correctly and efficiently. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
