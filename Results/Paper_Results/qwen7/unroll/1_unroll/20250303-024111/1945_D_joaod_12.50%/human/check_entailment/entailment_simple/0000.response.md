Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. It correctly parses the number of people in front (`na_frente`) and the maximum allowable final position (`pos_final`) for each test case.
3. It reads and stores the costs for swapping positions (`custo_pra_trocar_a`) and passing through positions (`custo_pra_passar_b`).
4. It initializes the variables `total` and `best` to keep track of the cumulative cost and the minimum cost found so far.
5. The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, updating the `total` cost and `best` minimum cost according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
6. The logic inside the loop correctly handles the conditions for swapping and passing through positions.
7. Finally, it prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
