Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the vertices chosen by Bessie are consecutive. For example, consider the following input:

```
4 2 2
1 3
```

In this case, the vertices 1 and 3 are chosen, and we can add 2 more vertices. The maximum number of non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake that can be formed is 2, but the program incorrectly calculates the result as 3.

The issue arises because the program checks for gaps of 2 between chosen vertices and counts them as additional triangles, but it does not correctly handle the scenario where the chosen vertices are consecutive or form larger gaps that do not allow additional triangles to be formed without exceeding the limit of `y`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the gaps between the chosen vertices and ensure that the additional vertices are added in a way that maximizes the number of triangles without exceeding the limit of `y`.
