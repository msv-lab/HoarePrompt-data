Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly iterates over each test case provided in `cas_de_test`.

2. **Total Points Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the total points for each test case and checks if they are even. If the total points are odd, it correctly identifies the scenario as invalid and appends `-1`.

3. **Total Matches Calculation**: The function correctly calculates the total number of matches played using the formula `total_points // 2`. This is correct because each match results in a total of 2 points being distributed (either 2-0 or 1-1).

4. **Maximum Matches Constraint**: The function correctly checks if the total number of matches exceeds 3 (the maximum possible number of unique pairs of players) or if the highest score exceeds half the total matches. If either condition is true, it appends `-1` for that test case.

5. **Draw Calculation**: For valid cases, the function correctly calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the points distribution among the players and correctly computes the number of draws.

6. **Output Format**: The function returns a list of results, where each element corresponds to the number of draws for each valid test case, and `-1` for invalid cases, which matches the required output format.

Given that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
