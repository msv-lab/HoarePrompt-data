### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**:
   - The program uses a hardcoded list `cas_de_test` to store the test cases. This is appropriate for the given problem since the number of test cases is fixed and small (7 cases). However, if the number of test cases can vary, the program should be modified to read from standard input or another data source.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` processes each test case and calculates the maximum number of draws.
   - It first checks if the total points (`total_points`) are even. If not, it immediately returns `-1` because an odd total points cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules.
   - It then calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) by dividing the total points by 2.
   - Next, it checks if the total number of matches is more than 3 or if the highest score (`p3`) is greater than the total number of matches. If either condition is true, it returns `-1` because these conditions violate the constraints of the problem.
   - Finally, it calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites // 2`, where `egalites` is calculated as `total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`. This formula accounts for the points distribution among the players considering the possibility of draws.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the results of each test case using `'\n'.join(map(str, resultats))`.

### Analysis of Provided Test Cases:
- **Case (0, 0, 0)**: No games, so no draws. Correct output: `0`.
- **Case (0, 1, 1)**: One draw between the second and third player. Correct output: `1`.
- **Case (0, 2, 3)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Case (3, 3, 3)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.
- **Case (3, 4, 5)**: Six draws. Correct output: `6`.
- **Case (1, 1, 10)**: Two draws between the first and second player, and four draws between the first and third player. Correct output: `2`.
- **Case (0, 0, 6)**: Invalid case because the scores do not match any valid combination of games. Correct output: `-1`.

### Detailed Evaluation:
- The original assessment correctly identified the logic and the test cases provided. However, there are a few points to consider:
  - The function `func_1` assumes a fixed number of test cases, which is fine for the given problem but may need adjustment for variable input sizes.
  - The formula used to calculate the number of draws is correct and aligns with the problem constraints.
  - The handling of invalid cases (odd total points, total matches > 3, or highest score > total matches) is appropriate and ensures the program returns `-1` when necessary.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws for each test case. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning.

### Final:
**True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and test cases.
