Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of draws and validating the scores has some flaws:

1. **Total Matches Calculation**: The current logic calculates the total number of matches (`total_matchs`) as `total_points // 2`. However, this might not be accurate because each match can contribute either 2 points (one win, one loss) or 2 points split between two draws.

2. **Validation of Scores**: The validation checks if `p3 > total_matchs`, which is not sufficient. The correct condition should ensure that the distribution of points among the players is feasible given the constraints of the game.

3. **Calculation of Draws**: The formula for calculating the number of draws (`egalites // 2`) might not always yield the correct result due to the complex nature of point distribution in the game.

To fix these issues, the program needs to correctly account for the possible distributions of wins, losses, and draws while ensuring the scores are consistent. Here is a revised version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def func_1(t, cas_de_test):
    resultats = []
    for (p1, p2, p3) in cas_de_test:
        # Check if total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of matches
        max_matches = (p1 + p2 + p3) // 2
        
        # Check if the scores are feasible
        if p3 > max_matches or p1 + p2 + p3 > 6 * max_matches:
            resultats.append(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the number of draws
        for d in range(max_matches + 1):
            w1 = (p1 - d) // 2
            w2 = (p2 - d) // 2
            w3 = (p3 - d) // 2
            if (w1 + w2 + w3 == max_matches - d) and (w1 >= 0 and w2 >= 0 and w3 >= 0):
                resultats.append(d)
                break
        else:
            resultats.append(-1)
    
    return resultats
```

This revised function correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the scores are consistent with the game rules.
