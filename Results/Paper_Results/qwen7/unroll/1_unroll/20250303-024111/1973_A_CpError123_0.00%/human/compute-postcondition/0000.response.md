Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `cas_de_test` is a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers p_1, p_2, and p_3 representing the scores of the three players in each test case, sorted non-decreasingly such that 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30; `resultats` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `resultats`. No changes are made to the values of `t` or `cas_de_test`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `resultats` is initialized as an empty list.
