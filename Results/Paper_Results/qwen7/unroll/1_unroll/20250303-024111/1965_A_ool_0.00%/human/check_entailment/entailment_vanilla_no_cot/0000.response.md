Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of piles `n` and the array `arr` incorrectly. It should read `n` first and then the `n` elements of the array, but instead it reads them together as a single list.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called with an argument that is itself a list containing `n` and the array. However, `func_1` expects only the array as its argument.

3. **Logic Error in `func_1`**: The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It checks if the smallest pile is not 1 and returns "Alice" immediately. This is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach involves calculating the Nim-sum (XOR of all pile sizes) and determining the winner based on whether the Nim-sum is zero or not.

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    nim_sum = 0
    for pile in arr:
        nim_sum ^= pile
    
    if nim_sum == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

This version correctly reads the input, calculates the Nim-sum, and determines the winner based on the Nim-sum value.
