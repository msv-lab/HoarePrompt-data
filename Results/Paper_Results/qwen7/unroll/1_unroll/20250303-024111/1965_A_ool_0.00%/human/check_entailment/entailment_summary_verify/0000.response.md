### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function `func_1` step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- The game involves multiple piles of stones, and players take turns removing a number of stones equal to the smallest non-empty pile from all non-empty piles.
- The player who cannot make a move loses.
- The function `func_1` should determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
1. **Initial Check**: The function checks if the first element of the array is not 1. If true, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
2. **Unique Values and Sorting**: It creates a sorted list of unique values from the input array.
3. **Gap Check**: It iterates through the sorted unique values to check if there are any gaps greater than 1. If such gaps exist, it sets `not_c` to `False`.
4. **Winner Determination**: Based on the value of `not_c`, it returns 'Alice' or 'Bob'.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
- **Input**:
  ```
  2
  3
  2 2 2
  2
  1 1
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  ```
  Alice
  Bob
  ```

- **Actual Output**:
  ```
  Alice
  Alice
  ```

1. **First Subcase (2 2 2)**:
   - Unique values: `[2]`
   - Sorted unique values: `[2]`
   - No gaps, so `not_c` remains `True`.
   - Returns 'Alice' (incorrect).

2. **Second Subcase (1 1)**:
   - Unique values: `[1]`
   - Sorted unique values: `[1]`
   - No gaps, so `not_c` remains `True`.
   - Returns 'Alice' (incorrect).

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The function `func_1` does not correctly simulate the game logic. It incorrectly assumes that the presence of a gap in the sorted unique values determines the winner, which is not accurate.
- The function does not simulate the actual game moves and determine the winner based on the game rules.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the game logic and fails to determine the winner accurately for certain inputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
