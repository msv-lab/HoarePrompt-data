Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Implementation**: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the new position of an entity on the field based on its current position and the direction of movement. However, the implementation of `func_1` is incorrect. It sums up the elements of the first and second rows of the 2D list `a` with the elements of `b`, which has no relation to the intended functionality of moving an entity on the field. The correct implementation should update the position `(x, y)` based on the direction of movement `(dx, dy)`.

2. **Field Representation**: The field is represented as a 2D list `a`, but the function `func_1` does not correctly handle this representation. Instead, it should take the current position `(x, y)` and the direction of movement `(dx, dy)` to compute the new position.

3. **Game Logic**: The game logic appears to be mostly correct. It handles player movements, catching the Quaffle, throwing the Quaffle, and scoring points. However, the incorrect implementation of `func_1` could lead to incorrect positions being calculated, potentially affecting the game's outcome.

Given these points, the program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the `func_1` function.

Correctness: **False**
