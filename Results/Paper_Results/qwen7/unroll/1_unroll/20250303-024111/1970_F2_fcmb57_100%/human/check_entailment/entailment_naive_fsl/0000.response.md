Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle. According to the problem description, if a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated, the Quaffle remains on the cell containing both the player and the Bludger. However, the program does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the `func_1` function and the logic around player elimination do not properly handle the situation where a player carrying the Quaffle is eliminated. This oversight means the program may produce incorrect results in such scenarios.
