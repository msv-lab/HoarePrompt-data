Output State: **`a` is a 2D list representing the field, where each element is a string; `b` is an integer representing the number of steps in the game; `x` is the first row of the 2D list `a`, and `y` is the second row of the 2D list `a`.**

Explanation: The code `x, y = a` unpacks the 2D list `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` is a 2D list, `x` will be assigned the first row of `a` and `y` will be assigned the second row of `a`. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged, and `b` also remains unchanged.
