Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and the Bludger.
   - The program initializes the middle of the field and the initial state of the Quaffle.

2. **Movement and Action Handling**:
   - The program correctly handles player movements and updates their positions.
   - It checks for collisions with the Bludger and eliminates the player if they are in the same position.
   - The program correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player moves with it.
   - It correctly handles the catching of the Quaffle and throwing it into a goal.

3. **Scoring and Elimination**:
   - The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message.
   - It correctly handles the elimination of players and updates the Quaffle's position accordingly.
   - The program sorts the eliminated players alphabetically before printing them.

4. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the final score and prints it in the required format.

5. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity given a direction.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the necessary actions and updates the state of the game appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
