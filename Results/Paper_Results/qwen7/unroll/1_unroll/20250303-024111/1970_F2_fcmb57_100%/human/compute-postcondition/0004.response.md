Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list `a` where each element is a string, and an integer `b`. It converts the elements of the first and second rows of the 2D list `a` to integers, adds the first element of `b` to the sum of the first row and the second element of `b` to the sum of the second row, and returns a tuple containing these sums.**
