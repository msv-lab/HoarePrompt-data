Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing an integer `n` and a binary string of length `n`. The function then finds the first and last positions of '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function prints the count of '0's for each test case.**
