Reasoning:
1. The problem requires moving chips to the left to form a single block without any free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - It finds the first and last positions of '1' in the binary string but does not account for the need to move chips to the leftmost possible position.
   - It extracts a substring between these positions and counts the number of '0's, which does not necessarily give the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block.
3. The solution fails to consider the optimal strategy for moving chips to the leftmost possible position, which is crucial for minimizing the number of operations.

Correctness: **False**

The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It does not account for the necessary movements of chips to achieve the desired configuration with the minimum number of operations.
