Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration i from 0 to t-1, n_i is an integer, arr_i is a string without spaces, x_i is the index of the first '1' in arr_i, y_i is the index of the first '1' from the reverse of arr_i, and z_i is a substring of arr_i from x_i to n - y_i (inclusive), where n is the length of arr_i. The value of z_i is the count of '0's in z_i.**
