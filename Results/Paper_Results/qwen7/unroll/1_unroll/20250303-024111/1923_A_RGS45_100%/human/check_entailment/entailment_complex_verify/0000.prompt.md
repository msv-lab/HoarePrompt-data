You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        x = arr.find('1')
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        print(z.count('0'))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.
def func():
    t = int(input(''))
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input(''))
        
        arr = ''.join(input('').split())
        
        x = arr.find('1')
        
        y = arr[::-1].find('1')
        
        z = arr[x:n - y]
        
        print(z.count('0'))
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration i from 0 to t-1, n_i is an integer, arr_i is a string without spaces, x_i is the index of the first '1' in arr_i, y_i is the index of the first '1' from the reverse of arr_i, and z_i is a substring of arr_i from x_i to n - y_i (inclusive), where n is the length of arr_i. The value of z_i is the count of '0's in z_i.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` lines, each containing an integer `n` and a binary string of length `n`. The function then finds the first and last positions of '1' in the string, extracts the substring between these positions, and counts the number of '0's in this substring. The function prints the count of '0's for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program attempts to find the first and last positions of chips ('1') in the string representation of the array and then calculates the number of zeros ('0') between these positions. However, this approach does not account for the fact that chips can only move to the closest free cell to the left, and it does not ensure that the final configuration has no free cells between chips.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```
The program outputs `1`, but the correct output should be `1` as well, which the program does get right. However, for the input:
```
5
1 0 1 0 1
```
The program incorrectly outputs `2`, but the correct output should be `2`. The program fails to handle the case where chips need to move past multiple free cells to form a single block.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the minimum number of operations by considering the distance each chip needs to move to the nearest free cell to the left and ensuring that all chips end up in a contiguous block without any free cells in between.
