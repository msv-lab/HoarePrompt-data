### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly maximizes the sum of the array elements according to the problem description.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function is responsible for setting all elements within a specified range to a specific value.
- If `l == r` and `a[l]` is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and records the operation.
- Otherwise, it recursively processes the subarray from `l + 1` to `r` and then sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` if necessary.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function aims to maximize the sum of the subarray defined by `l` and `r`.
- If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` and records the operation.
- Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray, updates `ops` with the operation, and recursively calls itself on the left and right subarrays excluding the position of the maximum element.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to process the entire array and returns the sum of the elements, the number of operations, and the list of operations.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

### Analysis of Correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function correctly handles the base case where `l == r` and ensures that `a[l]` is set to zero if it is not already zero.
   - For the general case, it ensures that all elements in the range `[l, r]` are set to `r - l + 1` if necessary. This is crucial for maximizing the sum of the array.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The function correctly identifies when the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\). In this case, it sets all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`, which is the optimal value to maximize the sum.
   - If the sum is greater, it finds the maximum element and recursively processes the subarrays excluding the position of the maximum element. This ensures that the maximum value is spread out to maximize the sum.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly processes the entire array using `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the required outputs.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function correctly reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Example 1**:
   ```
   Input:
   2
   0 1
   
   Expected Output:
   4 1
   1 2
   ```

   - The program correctly sets both elements to 2, resulting in a sum of 4.

2. **Example 2**:
   ```
   Input:
   3
   1 3 9
   
   Expected Output:
   13 0
   ```

   - The array is already optimal, so no operations are needed.

3. **Example 3**:
   ```
   Input:
   4
   1 100 2 1
   
   Expected Output:
   105 2
   3 3
   3 4
   ```

   - The program correctly sets the subarray from index 3 to 3 to 2 and then sets the subarray from index 3 to 4 to 2, resulting in a sum of 105.

4. **Example 4**:
   ```
   Input:
   1
   0
   
   Expected Output:
   1 1
   1 1
   ```

   - The program correctly sets the single element to 1, resulting in a sum of 1.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements by setting subarrays to the smallest possible values that adhere to the MEX constraint. The provided examples and the overall structure of the functions support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
