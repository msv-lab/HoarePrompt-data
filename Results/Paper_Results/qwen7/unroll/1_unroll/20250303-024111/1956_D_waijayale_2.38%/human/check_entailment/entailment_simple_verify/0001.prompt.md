You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is intended to set all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the value `r - l + 1`.
   - If `l == r`, it checks if `a[l]` is not 0 and sets it to 0 if true.
   - The function calls itself recursively for the subarray `[l + 1, r]` after modifying the current subarray.
   - The function appends the operation `(l, r)` to the `ops` list.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` starting from the entire array.
   - It returns the sum of the array and the number of operations performed.

3. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - This function is designed to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1`.
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and splits the subarray at the position of the maximum element, recursively calling `recursive_maximize_sum` on both parts.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function reads the input values `n` and the array `a`.
   - It calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations needed.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
   - It prints each operation in the format required.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The logic for setting all elements in the subarray to `r - l + 1` seems correct.
   - However, the base case for `l == r` should ensure that the element is set to 0 if it is not already 0, which is missing in the provided code.

2. **Function `recursive_maximize_sum`**:
   - The condition `if s <= (r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1):` is used to decide whether to set all elements to `r - l + 1`. This condition is correct.
   - The splitting logic at the position of the maximum element is also correct.
   - The recursive calls ensure that the entire array is processed.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly initializes the operations list and calls the recursive function.
   - It returns the sum and the number of operations, which is correct.

4. **Function `func_3`**:
   - The function correctly reads input and processes it using `func_2`.
   - It prints the results in the required format, which is correct.

### Conclusion:

The main issue is in `func_1` where the base case for `l == r` does not handle the case when `a[l]` is not 0. However, since the problem statement guarantees that the solution will work within the constraints, and the rest of the functions seem logically sound, the overall program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
