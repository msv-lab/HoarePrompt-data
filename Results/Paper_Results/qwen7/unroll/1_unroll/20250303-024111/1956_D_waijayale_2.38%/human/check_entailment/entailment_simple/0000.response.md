Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in the array \(a\) by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray.
2. The provided functions and logic seem to correctly implement the solution:
   - `func_1` handles the base case when \(l == r\). If \(a[l]\) is not 0, it sets \(a[l]\) to 0 and records the operation.
   - `func_2` initializes the process by calling `recursive_maximize_sum` and returning the final sum and operations.
   - `recursive_maximize_sum` recursively maximizes the sum of the subarray from \(l\) to \(r\). If the current sum \(s\) is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)\), it sets the entire subarray to the value \(r - l + 1\). Otherwise, it finds the maximum value in the subarray and recursively calls itself on the left and right parts.
   - `func_3` reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result along with the operations.

Given the structure and logic of the functions, they appear to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The operations are recorded and the sum is calculated as required.

Correctness: **True**
