Output State: **`mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, `s` is the sum of elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive, `a` remains a list of non-negative integers of length `n`, where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, `ops` is a list that now includes the operation `s = sum(a[l:r + 1])`, `pos` is the index of the maximum value `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` adjusted by `l`.**

Explanation: The code finds the index of the maximum value `mx` within the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` and adjusts this index by adding `l` to it. This results in the variable `pos` holding the absolute position of `mx` in the original list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
