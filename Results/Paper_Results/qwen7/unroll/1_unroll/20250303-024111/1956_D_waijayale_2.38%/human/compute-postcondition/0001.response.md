Output State: **`a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 <= a_i <= 10^7, and n is the number of integers entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input from the user, converts each integer to an int type using the map function, and then creates a list from these integers. The length of the list `a` is equal to the number of integers entered by the user, which is stored in `n`. Therefore, `n` is updated to the number of integers entered, and `a` becomes a list of these integers.
