Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two integers t, x, and y. For each test case, t represents the number of subsequent cases (with constraints 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and x and y are integers within the range 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99. The function returns different outputs based on the values of x and y for each test case.**

Given the constraints, the function likely iterates over a series of test cases defined by `t`, and for each case, it processes `x` and `y` to produce some output, though the specific output is not detailed in the given information.
