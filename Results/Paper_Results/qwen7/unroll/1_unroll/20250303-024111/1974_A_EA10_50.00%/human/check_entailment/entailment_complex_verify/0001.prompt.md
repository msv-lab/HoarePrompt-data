You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        print(z)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        z = (y + 1) // 2
        
        m = 15 * z - y * 4
        
        if m < a:
            z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15
        
        print(z)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer after all loop iterations, `z` is the final value calculated for each iteration of the loop based on the input values `x` and `y`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers: t, x, and y. For each test case, it calculates a value z based on x and y, ensuring z meets certain conditions relative to t. It then prints the final value of z for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated values of z for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading pairs of integers `(x, y)` representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens Needed**:
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This formula represents the minimum number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the screens without considering the remaining space.
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula calculates the total number of 1x1 cells that can be filled by the 2x2 icons already placed.
   - If `m` is less than `a`, it means there are not enough cells to accommodate all 1x1 icons using the existing 2x2 icons. Therefore, additional screens are needed. The number of additional screens required is calculated as `(x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`, which accounts for the remaining 1x1 icons and ensures that each screen is fully utilized.

3. **Output**:
   - The final result `z` is printed, which represents the minimum number of screens needed.

### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic against the provided examples:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(1 - 11 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0`
  - Total screens: `1 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 2**: `7 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m >= a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `1 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 3**: `12 4`
  - `z = (4 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 4 * 4 = 22`
  - Since `m > a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `2 + 0 = 2`

- **Test Case 4**: `0 3`
  - `z = (3 + 1) // 2 = 2`
  - `m = 15 * 2 - 3 * 4 = 18`
  - Since `m > a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `2 + 0 = 2`

- **Test Case 5**: `1 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(1 - 0 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Total screens: `0 + 1 = 1`

- **Test Case 6**: `8 1`
  - `z = (1 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 1 * 4 = 11`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(8 - 11 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 0`
  - Total screens: `1 + 0 = 1`

- **Test Case 7**: `0 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - No additional screens needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 8**: `2 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - No additional screens needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 9**: `15 0`
  - `z = (0 + 1) // 2 = 0`
  - `m = 15 * 0 - 0 * 4 = 0`
  - No additional screens needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `0 + 0 = 0`

- **Test Case 10**: `8 2`
  - `z = (2 + 1) // 2 = 1`
  - `m = 15 * 1 - 2 * 4 = 7`
  - Since `m < a`, we need additional screens: `(8 - 7 + 15 - 1) // 15 = 1`
  - Total screens: `1 + 1 = 2`

- **Test Case 11**: `0 9`
  - `z = (9 + 1) // 2 = 5`
  - `m = 15 * 5 - 9 * 4 = 45`
  - Since `m > a`, no additional screens are needed: `0`
  - Total screens: `5 + 0 = 5`
