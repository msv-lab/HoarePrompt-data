Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking if Subarray is Good**: 
   - The solution tries to count the number of `1`s (`j`) and the sum of elements (`i`) in the subarray.
   - It then checks if the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where all elements are positive and different from the original elements. This is not correctly implemented.
   - The condition `if b - a + 1 > 1 and s - (b - a + 1) >= i:` does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into a good array. This condition only checks if the sum of the subarray minus the length of the subarray is greater than or equal to the count of `1`s in the subarray, which is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is good.

2. **Proper Approach**:
   - To determine if a subarray is good, we need to check if it is possible to rearrange the elements such that all elements are positive and distinct. 
   - A key observation is that for a subarray to be good, the sum of the subarray must be at least twice the length of the subarray because each element in the new array `b` must be at least 1 and different from the corresponding element in the subarray `a`.
   - Additionally, the subarray should contain at least one element that is not 1, otherwise, it cannot be transformed into a good array.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def is_good_subarray(l, a, b):
    subarray_sum = sum(l[a-1:b])
    subarray_length = b - a + 1
    # Check if the subarray can be transformed into a good array
    if subarray_sum < subarray_length or subarray_sum - subarray_length < subarray_length - 1:
        return 'NO'
    else:
        return 'YES'

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for _ in range(m):
            (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
            print(is_good_subarray(l, a, b))

func()
```

This version correctly checks if the subarray can be transformed into a good array by ensuring the sum of the subarray is at least twice its length and that there is at least one element that is not 1.
