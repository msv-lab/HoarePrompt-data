t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries each defined by a pair of integers l_i and r_i representing the subarray c_{l_i}, c_{l_i}+1, ..., c_{r_i}. Additionally, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5, and the sum of q across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
