Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the logic for counting the cuts is flawed. The program counts the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0' and the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1'. However, this approach does not always yield the minimum number of cuts required.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `111000`
- Expected Output: `2` (The string can be cut into "111" and "000" and rearranged into a sorted binary string.)
- Program Output: `1` (The program incorrectly counts the transitions and outputs 1 instead of 2.)

The program fails to account for the possibility of having multiple '1's and '0's without a transition, which requires additional cuts. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
