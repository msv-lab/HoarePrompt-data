The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of "01" and "10" substrings in the binary string `s`. If there are no "01" substrings, it prints the count of "10" substrings plus one. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the counts of "01" and "10" substrings. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
