You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        cut0 = 0
        cut1 = 0
        for i in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[i] == '1' and a[i + 1] == '0':
                cut1 += 1
            if a[i] == '0' and a[i + 1] == '1':
                cut0 += 1
        if cut0 == 0:
            print(cut1 + 1)
        else:
            print(cut0 + cut1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of "01" and "10" substrings in the binary string `s`. If there are no "01" substrings, it prints the count of "10" substrings plus one. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the counts of "01" and "10" substrings. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cuts required to split the binary string into pieces such that these pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string means all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters `cut0` and `cut1` to count the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' and a '1' is followed by a '0', respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `a` and increments the respective counters based on the conditions mentioned.
   - Finally, it prints the result based on the values of `cut0` and `cut1`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for counting transitions from '0' to '1' and '1' to '0' is correct.
   - However, the logic for determining the minimum number of cuts is flawed.
   - The program assumes that the number of cuts needed is the sum of `cut0` and `cut1`, which is not always correct.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the string "0101". According to the current logic:
     - `cut0` will be 1 (for "01").
     - `cut1` will be 1 (for "10").
     - The program will print `cut0 + cut1 = 2`, but the correct answer should be 1 because we can split the string into "0" and "101".

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - The correct approach is to count the number of '1's before the first '0' and the number of '0's after the last '1'. The total number of cuts needed will be the maximum of these two counts plus one.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of cuts needed. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
