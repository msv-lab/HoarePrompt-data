Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list of n integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without needing any additional parameters passed directly to it.
