Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game on n piles of stones. On each player's turn,
they select a positive integer k that is at most the size of the smallest
nonempty pile and remove k stones from each nonempty pile at once. The first
player who is unable to make a move (because all piles are empty) loses.

Given that Alice goes first, who will win the game if both players play
optimally?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le
2\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of piles in the game.

The next line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i -th
pile.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2\cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming
both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice", otherwise print
"Bob" (without quotes).

    5 7 2 9 6 3 3 2
    
    1
    
    1000000000

Output

    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    Bob
    Alice
    Alice
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can win by choosing k=3 on her first turn, which
will empty all of the piles at once.

In the second test case, Alice must choose k=1 on her first turn since there
is a pile of size 1 , so Bob can win on the next turn by choosing k=6 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each i, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = map(int, input().split())
        
        lis = sorted(set(l))
        
        if 1 not in lis or len(lis) == 1:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            test = True
            for j in range(1, len(lis)):
                if lis[j] - lis[j - 1] > 1:
                    if j % 2 == 1:
                        print('Bob')
                    else:
                        print('Alice')
                    test = False
                    break
            if test == True:
                if len(lis) % 2 == 1:
                    print('Alice')
                else:
                    print('Bob')
        
    #State: The output will depend on the input integers provided within the range of 1 to 10^4. For each input integer t, the program processes t lines of space-separated integers. It then checks the sorted unique list of these integers to determine if 'Alice' or 'Bob' should be printed based on specific conditions related to gaps between consecutive elements in the list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by t lines of input. Each line contains a positive integer n and a list of n integers. The function sorts and removes duplicate integers from the list, then checks the gaps between consecutive integers. Based on the presence of gaps greater than one and their positions, the function determines and prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
