Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input itself, which is used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` will return a value within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will run for as many times as the value returned by `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `int(input())`, which should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ int(input()) ≤ 10^4**
