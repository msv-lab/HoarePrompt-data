Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n`, an integer `k`, and a list of `n` unique integers. For each test case, it swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`, then counts how many elements in the sublist starting from the first element up to index `k-1` are greater than or equal to the first element. It then swaps back the first and the element at index `k-1`. Next, it finds the first occurrence of the maximum element in the list starting from the element at index `p+1` to `k-1`, and counts how many elements in this sublist are greater than or equal to this maximum element. Finally, it prints the maximum of the two counts obtained.**
