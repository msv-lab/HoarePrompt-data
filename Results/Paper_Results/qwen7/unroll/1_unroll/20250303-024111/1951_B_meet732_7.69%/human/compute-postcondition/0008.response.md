Based on the initial state provided:

- `ind` is a list containing at most two indices where the elements in `a` are greater than `x`.
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows.
- `k` is 14.
- `x` is the 14th element of the list `a`.
- `c` is either 0 or 2.

The `print(ind)` statement will print the list `ind`. Since `ind` contains at most two indices where the elements in `a` are greater than `x`, and `x` is the 14th element of `a`, `ind` will contain up to two indices of elements in `a` that are greater than the 14th element.

However, without the actual list `a`, we cannot determine the exact indices. But we know it will be a list with at most two elements, and these elements will be indices of the elements in `a` that are greater than `x`.

Output: **[indices where elements in a are greater than x]**
