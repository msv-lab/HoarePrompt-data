Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all cases properly and does not account for the optimal strategy for maximizing the number of wins for cow `k`. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Indices**: The function does not correctly identify the indices where the elements in `a` are greater than `x` (the `k`-th element). It breaks out of the loop after finding two such indices, which might not be optimal.

2. **Logic for Returning Values**: The logic for returning the number of wins is flawed. The function does not consider the best possible swaps or positions for `k` to maximize its wins.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `k` is the smallest or largest element in the list, or when there are no elements greater than `x`.

Given these issues, the function does not correctly compute the maximum number of wins for cow `k`.

Correctness: **False**
