Output State: **`ind` is an empty list, `a` is a list of n distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of the cows, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= n, `x` is the k-th element of the list `a`, `c` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `c` to 0. This does not affect the values of `ind`, `a`, `k`, or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions with `c` being set to 0.
