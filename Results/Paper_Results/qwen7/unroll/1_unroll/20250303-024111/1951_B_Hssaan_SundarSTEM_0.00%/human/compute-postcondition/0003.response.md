Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, where for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on the input parameters, but the specific return value is not detailed here.**
