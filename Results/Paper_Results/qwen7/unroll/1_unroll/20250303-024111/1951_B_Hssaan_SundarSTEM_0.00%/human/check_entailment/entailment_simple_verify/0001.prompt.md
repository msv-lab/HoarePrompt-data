You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cows `n` and the index of the cow `k`.
   - It then reads the ratings of the cows into a list `s`.

2. **Swapping Positions:**
   - The program swaps the positions of the cow at index `0` and the cow at index `k-1`. This is done to consider the scenario where the cow at position `k` is moved to the first position.
   - After swapping, it initializes `ans` to 0 and sets `h` to the rating of the cow at the first position (`s[0]`).

3. **Counting Wins:**
   - The program iterates through the ratings starting from the second position (`s[1:]`).
   - If the current rating is greater than `h`, it breaks out of the loop because the cow at the first position cannot win any more matches.
   - Otherwise, it increments `ans` for each win.

4. **Reverting Swap and Counting Wins Again:**
   - The program reverts the swap by swapping back the positions of the cow at index `0` and `k-1`.
   - It then finds the index `p` of the cow with the highest rating among the first `k-1` cows.
   - It swaps the cow at index `p` with the cow at index `k-1`.
   - It initializes `ans1` to 0 and `z` to 0.
   - It iterates through the ratings again, counting wins similarly to the previous loop but with a slight modification to handle the case where the cow at position `k` might have already won some matches before being swapped to the first position.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum of `ans` and `ans1`, which represents the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve.

### Verification Against Test Cases:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `6 1` followed by `[12, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3]`.
   - Expected Output: `1`.
   - Explanation: Swapping the cow at position 1 with the cow at position 1 (no change) results in the cow winning 1 match. Swapping the cow at position 1 with the cow at position 2 also results in the cow winning 1 match. Thus, the maximum wins are 1.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `6 5` followed by `[7, 2, 727, 10, 12, 13]`.
   - Expected Output: `2`.
   - Explanation: Swapping the cow at position 5 with the cow at position 3 allows the cow to win 2 matches. Swapping the cow at position 5 with the cow at position 1 results in fewer wins. Thus, the maximum wins are 2.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `2 2` followed by `[1000000000, 1]`.
   - Expected Output: `0`.
   - Explanation: The cow at position 2 cannot win any matches since the cow at position 1 has a higher rating. Swapping the cow at position 2 with the cow at position 1 still results in 0 wins.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles the logic of swapping positions and counting the maximum number of wins. It considers both scenarios (swapping and not swapping) and outputs the maximum wins accordingly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
