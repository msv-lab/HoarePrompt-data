State: **ntest is an input integer such that 1 ≤ ntest ≤ 500, itest is 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `itest` is initialized to 0.
- The loop runs as long as `itest` is less than `ntest`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `itest` must be 0 and `ntest` must be greater than 0.
- Since `ntest` is given to be within the range 1 ≤ ntest ≤ 500, this condition is already satisfied.
- Hence, the only state that needs adjustment is `itest` being set to 0.

So, the final state is: **`ntest` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ ntest ≤ 500, `itest` is 0**.
