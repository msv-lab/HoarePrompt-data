#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, a is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], and s is a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list where elements are appended based on the direction specified in `s`, `r` is -1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `l` remains 0 because it is only incremented when the character in `s` is 'L', and there are no 'L' characters at the start of the string `s` (since we are iterating from the beginning). The variable `r` is decremented until it reaches -1, as it starts from `n-1` and is decremented in each iteration corresponding to the 'R' characters in `s`. The list `b` will contain elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `l` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4], `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`, `r` is -1, `ans` is a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, `p` is -1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, with the list reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^4]), and `s` (a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified in `s`. Then, it calculates the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m` and returns a list of these products, with the list itself reversed.
