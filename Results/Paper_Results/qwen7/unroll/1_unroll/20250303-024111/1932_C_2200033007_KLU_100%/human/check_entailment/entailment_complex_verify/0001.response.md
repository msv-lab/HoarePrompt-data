### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Description and Input/Output Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases using a loop.
   - It reads the values of \( n \), \( m \), the array \( a \), and the string \( s \) for each test case.
   - It calls the function `func_1(n, m, a, s)` to process the commands and compute the required remainders.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function initializes an empty list `b` to store intermediate results.
   - It sets up two pointers, `l` and `r`, to traverse the array `a` from both ends.
   - It processes each command in the string `s`:
     - If the command is 'L', it appends the leftmost element of `a` to `b` and increments the left pointer `l`.
     - If the command is 'R', it appends the rightmost element of `a` to `b` and decrements the right pointer `r`.
   - After processing all commands, it computes the product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and stores the results in reverse order in the list `ans`.
   - The function returns the reversed list `ans`.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations provided are generally correct but have some inaccuracies:
     - The annotation states that `l` remains 0 after the loop, which is incorrect because `l` is incremented when 'L' is encountered.
     - The annotation states that `r` is -1, which is also incorrect; it should be 0 after the loop.
     - The annotation mentions that `ans` is a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, which is correct but doesn't mention the reversal step explicitly.

4. **Correctness of the Program:**
   - The program correctly processes each command and updates the array `a`.
   - It correctly computes the product of the elements in `b` modulo `m` and stores the results in reverse order.
   - The final list `ans` is returned in the correct order, matching the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the commands as expected.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
