Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in list `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, with the list reversed.**

Explanation: The code `return reversed(ans)` simply returns the list `ans` in reversed order. We know that `ans` is a list of integers where each integer is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Therefore, the program returns this list in reversed order.
