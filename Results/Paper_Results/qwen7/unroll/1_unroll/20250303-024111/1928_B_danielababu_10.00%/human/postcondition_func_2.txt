The function processes user input consisting of multiple integers across several test cases. It reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the length of the array `a`, followed by `n` integers which are the elements of the array `a`. After processing all test cases, it returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains the integers entered by the user for each respective test case.
