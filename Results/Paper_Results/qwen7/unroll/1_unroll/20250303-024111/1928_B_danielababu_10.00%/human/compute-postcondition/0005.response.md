Output State: **`ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of `arr` elements from right to left, starting with `tem` as 1**

Explanation: The code `return ans` simply returns the list `ans` which contains the cumulative product of elements in the list `arr` starting from the rightmost element and moving towards the left. The variable `tem` is used to keep track of the cumulative product and is initialized to 1. Since no further operations are performed on `ans` before returning it, the program returns the list `ans` as calculated.
