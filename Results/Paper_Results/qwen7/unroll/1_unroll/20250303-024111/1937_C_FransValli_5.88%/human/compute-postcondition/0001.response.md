Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4. After executing the loop, k and best are determined such that k is the smallest index i (2 ≤ i < n) for which the response to the query '? 0 k 0 i' is '<', and best is the smallest index j (1 ≤ j < n) for which the response to the query '? k best k j' is '<'.
