Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `i`, which is being iterated over in `min_indices`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `min_indices` contains at least one element. If `min_indices` is empty, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that `min_indices` is not empty for the loop to execute. Since `min_indices` is a list, it must contain at least one element.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `min_indices` is not empty.

**State:**
- `max_index` is the largest value of i for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such i exists.
- `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all i such that `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=' for each i in `min_indices`.
- `min_index` is `max_index`.

Since the loop will only execute if `min_indices` is not empty, we need to ensure that `min_indices` contains at least one element.

**Final State:**
State: **`max_index` is the largest value of i for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such i exists, `min_indices` is a non-empty list containing the indices of all i such that `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns '=', `min_index` is `max_index`**
