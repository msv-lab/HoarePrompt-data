Output State: **`max_index` is the largest value of i for which `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)` returns '<', or 0 if no such i exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the value of `max_index`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `min_indices` as a list containing the value of `max_index`. The value of `max_index` remains unchanged from its initial definition. Therefore, `min_indices` is a list with one element, which is the value of `max_index`.
