Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` from the user, where `2 <= n <= 10^4`. It then calls `func_1` and `func_2` to determine two indices, `max_index` and `min_index`, based on certain conditions. Finally, it calls `func_2` with these two indices as arguments. The function does not return any value.**
