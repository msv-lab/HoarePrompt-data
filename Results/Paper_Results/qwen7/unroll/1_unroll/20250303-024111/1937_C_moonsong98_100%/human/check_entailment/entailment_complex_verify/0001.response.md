### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic and steps of the program. However, let's systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning using the provided annotations.

#### Initialization and Input Reading
- The program reads `n` (the size of the permutation).
- For `n == 2`, it directly outputs the indices `[0, 1]` without further querying. This part is correct for `n == 2`.

#### Finding the Maximum Index
- The program initializes `max_index` to `0`.
- It iterates through all indices from `0` to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_0 | p_max_index)` with `(p_0 | p_i)`.
- If `(p_0 | p_i)` is less than `(p_0 | p_max_index)`, it updates `max_index` to `i`.
- This step aims to find an index `max_index` such that `(p_0 | p_max_index)` is maximized. This is a good approach to start finding the maximum potential candidate.

#### Finding the Minimum Indices
- The program initializes `min_indices` with `max_index`.
- It iterates through all indices again and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])` with `(p_max_index | p_i)`.
- If `(p_max_index | p_i)` is less than `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])`, it updates `min_indices` to `[i]`.
- If `(p_max_index | p_i)` is equal to `(p_max_index | p_min_indices[0])`, it appends `i` to `min_indices`.
- This step aims to find the minimum indices that have the same bitwise OR with `p_max_index`. This helps in narrowing down the search space.

#### Final Selection
- The program selects `min_index` from `min_indices` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p_min_index | p_min_index)` with `(p_min_index | p_i)` for each `i` in `min_indices`.
- If `(p_min_index | p_i)` is equal to `(p_min_index | p_min_index)`, it updates `min_index` to `i`.
- This step ensures that `min_index` is the one that maintains the maximum bitwise OR with `p_max_index`.

#### Output
- The program outputs the indices `max_index` and `min_index` using `func_2`.
