Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is an integer in {1, 2, 3}, `x` is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, and `indices` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `indices`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `x`. Therefore, their conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
