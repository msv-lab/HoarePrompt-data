Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `space` (a boolean) and `to_int` (a boolean). It returns a list of integers if both `to_int` and `space` are True, where the list is obtained by converting the items in the list `items` into integers. If `to_int` is False or `space` is False, it returns the list `items` as is, which contains characters from a line without being split into a list of strings.**
