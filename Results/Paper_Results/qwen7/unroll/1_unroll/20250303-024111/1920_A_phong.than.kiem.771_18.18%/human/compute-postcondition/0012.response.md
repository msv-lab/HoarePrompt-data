Output State: **The program returns the list `items` which contains characters from a line without being split into a list of strings.**

Given the initial state, the variable `to_int` is False, and `space` is False, meaning that the input line is not processed to convert it into integers or split it into a list of strings. Therefore, the variable `items` retains its state as a list of characters from the line. The code simply returns this list, so the output state is the list `items` containing characters from the line as they were read.
