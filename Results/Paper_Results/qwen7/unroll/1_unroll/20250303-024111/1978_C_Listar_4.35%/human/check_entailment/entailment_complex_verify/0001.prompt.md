You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

If `k` becomes 0 before completing all iterations, the list remains unchanged from its final state just before the return statement. If the loop completes all iterations without `k` becoming 0, the list will be reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12 inclusive). It manipulates a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` by moving the last element to the front repeatedly until `k` becomes 0 or the operation cannot be performed due to the value of `k`. If `k` becomes 0 before completing all iterations, the list remains unchanged from its final state just before the return statement. If the loop completes all iterations without `k` becoming 0, the list will be reversed. The function returns the modified list `l`.

    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` and `k` are integers. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `(n * n + k) / 2`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is set to `n`.

    return n, k
    #The program returns n and k, where n is an integer and k is an integer, and max_k is set to n (since n is even) and is not less than k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers, \( n \) and \( k \), from the user. It then checks if \( k \) is odd and returns (0, 0) if true. If \( k \) is even, it calculates \( max_k \) based on whether \( n \) is odd or even. If \( max_k \) is less than \( k \), it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \). The function can return either (0, 0) or a pair consisting of \( n \) and \( k \).

#Function 3:

    print()
    #This is printed: an empty line
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing positions in a permutation and prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list on a single line separated by spaces. It then prints an empty line and returns nothing (`None`).

    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns the value returned by func_3(l), where l is the return value of func_1(n, k)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function first calls `func_2()` to get values for `n` and `k`. If `n` is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns None. Otherwise, it calculates a value `l` using `func_1(n, k)` and then calls `func_3(l)`, returning whatever `func_3(l)` returns. If `func_3(l)` returns something, the function returns that value; otherwise, it returns None.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given code step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is defined as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} |p_i - i| \).

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function checks if a solution exists.
   - It returns `(0, 0)` if no solution exists.
   - If \( n \) is odd, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2 - 1}{2}\).
   - If \( n \) is even, the maximum possible Manhattan value is \(\frac{n^2}{2}\).
   - If \( k \) exceeds these maximum values, it returns `(0, 0)`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function constructs the permutation.
   - It starts with a list of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It iteratively moves the last element to the front until the required Manhattan value is achieved.
   - The logic seems to decrement \( k \) by the index positions as it moves elements.

4. **Function `func_3`:**
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It takes a list `l` as input and prints it.

5. **Function `func_4`:**
   - This function orchestrates the process.
   - It calls `func_2` to check if a solution exists.
   - If a solution exists, it calls `func_1` to construct the permutation and then `func_3` to print it.
   - If no solution exists, it prints "NO".

### Testing and Edge Cases

1. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 1 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "NO" because \( k = 1 \) cannot be achieved.

2. **Edge Case: \( n = 1 \), \( k = 0 \):**
   - The only permutation is `[1]`, and the Manhattan value is \( |1 - 1| = 0 \).
   - The function should return "YES" with the permutation `[1]`.

3. **General Case:**
   - For larger \( n \) and \( k \), the function should correctly construct a permutation if one exists.

### Conclusion

The code has some logical issues:
- The function `func_1` does not handle all cases correctly, especially when \( k \) is large.
- The function `func_2` correctly identifies when a solution is impossible, but the construction in `func_1` might fail to find a valid permutation.

Given these issues, the code is not fully correct.
