You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to generate a permutation with the specified Manhattan value for all cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function attempts to construct a permutation based on the given `n` and `k`, but it does not handle all possible scenarios correctly.

For instance, consider the test case `(n, k) = (5, 2)`. According to the problem description, we need to find a permutation of length 5 such that the Manhattan value is 2. One valid permutation is `[2, 1, 4, 3, 5]`, which has a Manhattan value of \(|2-1| + |1-2| + |4-3| + |3-4| + |5-5| = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 4\), which is incorrect. However, another valid permutation could be `[2, 1, 3, 5, 4]`, which has a Manhattan value of \(|2-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| + |5-4| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 4\), which is also incorrect.

The issue lies in how `func_1` constructs the permutation. It does not ensure that the Manhattan value is exactly `k` for all cases, especially when `k` is small relative to `n`. The function does not properly handle the insertion of elements to achieve the exact Manhattan value, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to meet the requirements for generating a permutation with the specified Manhattan value for all potential cases.
