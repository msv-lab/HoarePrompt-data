Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Bitmask Logic**: The code uses bitmasking to track the presence of characters in the string `s`. However, it incorrectly assumes that when `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, all possible combinations of length `n` have been found. This is incorrect because bitmasking only tracks the presence of characters but doesn't ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered.

2. **Subsequence Check**: The logic to check if all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences in `s` is flawed. The current implementation only checks if all characters from the first `k` alphabets appear in `s` at least once, which is insufficient.

3. **Generating Missing Subsequence**: Even if the code could correctly identify missing subsequences, the method to generate a sample missing subsequence (`tmp += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)`) is incorrect. It doesn't guarantee that the generated string will be a valid missing subsequence of length `n`.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a backtracking algorithm to ensure that all possible subsequences of length `n` are checked against the string `s`.
