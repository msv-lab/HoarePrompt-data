You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

After executing the loop, cnt is an integer representing the number of times the condition `cur == (1 << k) - 1` was met, cur is an integer used to track the current combination of characters, ans is a string built from characters that form a complete combination, and if cnt is less than n, ans is modified to include additional 'a' characters and a missing character to meet the count n.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to check if all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the given string `s`. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Bitmask Logic**: The program uses bitmasking to track the presence of characters in the current substring. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly handle the generation and checking of all possible strings of length `n`.

2. **Substring Generation**: The program does not generate all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets and check if they are subsequences of `s`. Instead, it tries to build a string `ans` by iterating through `s` and setting bits in the bitmask, which is not equivalent to generating all possible strings.

3. **Output Handling**: If the program determines that not all possible strings occur as subsequences, it constructs a string `ans` that includes a character not present in the required subsequences. However, this approach does not guarantee that the constructed string is the shortest or lexicographically smallest string that is not a subsequence.

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

The program incorrectly outputs `YES`, indicating that it believes all possible strings of length 3 using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets (`abc`) occur as subsequences of `aabbccabab`. However, the string `ccc` is a counterexample, as it does not occur as a subsequence of `aabbccabab`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, leading to a correctness of **False**.
