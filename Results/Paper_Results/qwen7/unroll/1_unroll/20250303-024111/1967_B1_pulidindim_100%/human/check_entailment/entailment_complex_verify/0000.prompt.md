You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. It is also guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        count = 2
        
        ans = n
        
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        
        print(int(ans))
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t`, followed by `t` lines, each containing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair `(n, m)` as described in the loop. Each result is the final value of `ans` after executing the loop for that specific input pair.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)), calculates a value based on these inputs using a specific algorithm, and prints the result. The final output consists of \( t \) lines, each line representing the calculated result for the corresponding test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs (a, b) does not accurately reflect the conditions specified in the problem description.

To illustrate, consider the test case (10, 8):

- According to the problem description, we need to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) such that \(1 \le a \le n\), \(1 \le b \le m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

- For the pair (10, 8), \(a + b = 18\) and \(\gcd(10, 8) = 2\). Since \(18\) is not a multiple of \(8 \cdot 2 = 16\), this pair should not be counted.

However, the provided program counts all pairs up to \(m\) without checking the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). This results in incorrect counts for many test cases.

For instance, the program outputs 153 for the test case (100, 1233), which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1643498, as per the given example.

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one potential case, making it incorrect.
