Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \) (where \( 1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \times 10^6 \)), calculates a value based on these inputs using a specific algorithm, and prints the result. The final output consists of \( t \) lines, each line representing the calculated result for the corresponding test case.**
