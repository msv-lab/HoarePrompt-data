Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After all the executions of the loop have finished, the values of n and k from each test case are processed according to the given conditions, and the result of the computation for each test case is printed. The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `f` are used within the loop but their final values do not affect the output. The output consists of lines, each containing the computed value `y` for each test case based on the given logic.
