You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `k` for each test case, which are the number of cards and the position of the card to find, respectively.

2. **Initial Variables:**
   - `s` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down.
   - `i` is used to count the number of times the loop iterates.
   - `d` is used to keep track of the number of remaining cards that can be laid down in the current iteration.
   - `h` is used to keep track of the number of remaining cards that can be laid down in the next iteration.
   - `p` is used to iterate through the number of times the loop has run.
   - `g` is used to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down in the previous iterations.

3. **Odd Numbered Cards:**
   - The program correctly handles the first part where it lays down all odd-numbered cards. This part is handled in the first `while` loop where it adds `(d + 1) // 2` to `s` and decreases `d` accordingly.

4. **Handling Larger Multiples:**
   - After laying down the odd-numbered cards, the program attempts to handle the larger multiples (2x, 3x, 4x, etc., of odd numbers).
   - However, the logic here is flawed. The program incorrectly calculates the position of the card to be printed after handling the odd-numbered cards.

5. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the remaining cards follow a specific pattern and tries to calculate the position directly without properly accounting for the sequence of cards laid down.
   - The calculation `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` does not correctly represent the position of the card in the sequence.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is greater than half of `n` separately, but even this part is incorrect because it does not accurately reflect the sequence of cards laid down.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the k-th card laid down according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
