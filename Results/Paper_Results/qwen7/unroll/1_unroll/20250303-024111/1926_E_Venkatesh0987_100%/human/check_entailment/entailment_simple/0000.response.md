### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Variables Initialization**:
   - `s`: Sum of the number of odd-numbered cards laid down so far.
   - `i`: Counter for the current multiplication factor (starting from 1).
   - `d`: Remaining number of cards that can be laid down at the current step.
   - `h`: Initial value of `n` used in calculations.
   - `p`: Counter for the current step in the inner loop.
   - `g`: Sum of the number of cards laid down in the inner loop.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The code checks if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. If true, it enters a loop to calculate the position of the `k`-th card among the multiples of odd numbers.
     - `s += (d + 1) // 2`: Adds the number of cards that can be laid down at the current step.
     - `d -= (d + 1) // 2`: Updates the remaining number of cards.
     - `i += 1`: Increments the multiplication factor.
   - After exiting the loop, it calculates the exact position within the current set of multiples using the formula `f = k - g`.
   - Finally, it computes the `k`-th card using `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` and prints it.

   - If `k` is not greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, it directly prints `2 * k - 1`, which is the `k`-th odd number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic handles the case where `k` is exactly the middle of the sequence of odd numbers correctly.
   - It also correctly handles the case where `k` is among the multiples of odd numbers.

5. **Output**:
   - The code prints the correct `k`-th card for each test case based on the described process.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to follow the problem description accurately and handles all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided execution states.
