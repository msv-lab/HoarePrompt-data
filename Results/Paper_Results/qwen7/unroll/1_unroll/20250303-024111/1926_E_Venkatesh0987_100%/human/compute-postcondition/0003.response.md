Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each `t`, two integers `n` and `k` such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 are processed. The function returns information based on the values of `n` and `k` for each test case.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`, and returns specific information derived from `n` and `k` for each case.
