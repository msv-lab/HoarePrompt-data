Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \(m\), \(n\), and two lists of integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each test case, it calculates a cost based on specific conditions involving elements from \(a\) and \(b\). These costs are then stored in a list `custos`. Finally, the function prints each cost in `custos` on a new line.**
