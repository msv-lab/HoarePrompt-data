Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`x`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the values of `num_fila` (which is `n` in the problem statement) and `max_p` (which is `m` in the problem statement) for each test case, and then reads the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and `b` in reverse order to calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `m` positions.
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems to be correct. It checks whether moving Kirill to the current position would result in a lower cost compared to staying in the current position and moving to the next one. This aligns with the problem's requirement to minimize the total cost while ensuring Kirill ends up in the first `m` positions.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where Kirill needs to move to the very first position by adding `a[0]` to the cost if necessary.
   - The logic for breaking out of the loop when a better position is found also seems to be correctly implemented.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the calculated cost for each test case on a new line.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
