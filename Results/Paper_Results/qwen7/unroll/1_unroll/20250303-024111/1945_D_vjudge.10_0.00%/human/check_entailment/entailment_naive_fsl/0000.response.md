Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where Kirill needs to move through multiple positions to reach his desired spot while minimizing the cost. 

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Input:
```
4
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```

### Expected Output:
To achieve the best result, Kirill should move from position 4 to position 2, paying `b_3` (which is 8) and `a_2` (which is 3). So the total cost should be `8 + 3 = 11`.

However, the program calculates the cost incorrectly. It starts from the last position and moves backwards, which does not guarantee the minimum cost. For instance, the program might incorrectly choose to move from position 4 to position 3, then from position 3 to position 2, resulting in a higher cost.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The program iterates from `num_fila - 1` to `max_p - 1` and then from `max_p - 1` to `0`. This approach does not ensure that the minimum cost is always chosen.
- The logic inside the loops does not correctly handle the cumulative cost calculation and does not ensure that the minimum cost path is followed.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem, hence the correctness is **False**.
