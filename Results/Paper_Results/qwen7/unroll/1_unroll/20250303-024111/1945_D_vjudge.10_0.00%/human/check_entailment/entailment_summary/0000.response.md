Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`x`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes variables like `custo`, `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values` appropriately.
3. **Reading Input Data**: The program correctly reads the values of `num_fila` (number of people in the queue excluding Kirill) and `max_p` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), followed by the lists `a_values` and `b_values`.
4. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The program iterates backward through the list to calculate the minimum cost required for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions.
   - For each position `y` from `num_fila-1` down to `max_p-1`, it checks whether moving to position `y` is cheaper using `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`.
   - It then iterates backward again from `max_p-1` to 1 to ensure that the cost calculation considers the optimal path to the desired position.
   - The logic seems to handle the transition costs correctly, ensuring that the minimum cost is accumulated.
5. **Output**: The program correctly stores the calculated costs in a list `custos` and prints each cost for each test case.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to follow the problem's requirements and logic correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
