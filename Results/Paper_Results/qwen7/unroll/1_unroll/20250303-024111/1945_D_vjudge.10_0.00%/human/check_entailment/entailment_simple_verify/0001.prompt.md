You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `x`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`max_p`), and the lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` people.
   - It iterates from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` to calculate the cost of moving to positions within the allowed range.
     - If `a_values[y] < b_values[y]`, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost.
     - Otherwise, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost.
   - After calculating the cost for positions within the allowed range, it iterates from `max_p - 1` down to `1` to ensure the minimum cost is achieved.
     - If `a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]`, it adds `b_values[y]` to the cost.
     - Otherwise, it adds `a_values[y]` to the cost.

3. **Output:**
   - The program appends the calculated cost to the `custos` list and prints the result for each test case.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and splits the strings into lists of integers.

2. **Cost Calculation Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating the cost seems to be correct. It ensures that Kirill pays the minimum possible amount by considering both `a_values` and `b_values`.
   - The program iterates through the list in reverse order to find the minimum cost path to the desired position.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases like when Kirill needs to move to the very first position by adding `a_values[0]` to the cost if necessary.
   - The logic for breaking out of the loop when the minimum cost is found is also correct.

4. **Output:**
   - The program correctly outputs the minimum cost for each test case.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears that the logic and handling of the input/output are correct. The program follows the problem statement accurately and computes the minimum cost as required.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
