You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000. a and b are lists of n positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    custos = []
    for i in range(x):
        custo = 0
        
        num_fila = 0
        
        max_p = 0
        
        a_values = []
        
        b_values = []
        
        nf = input().split()

        max_p = int(nf[1])
        
        a = input().split()
        
        b = input().split()
        
        for y in a:
            a_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in b:
            b_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in range(num_fila - 1, max_p - 1, -1):
            if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
                custo += a_values[y]
            else:
                custo += b_values[y]
        
        for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]
                break
        
        custos.append(custo)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `custos` is a list containing the sum of selected values from arrays `a` and `b` based on specific conditions for each iteration of the loop.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The output state will consist of each value in the list `custos`, printed on a new line.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through lists a and b, where each list contains n positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. The function also receives two additional integers m and n, both within the range 1 to 200,000, with the condition that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. It returns a value based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
