Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 24\), the input integer must also fall within this range. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) transition videos are already decided, and all other characters are undecided (\?), remains valid.
