Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are some key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Deciding Video Types**: The logic used to decide whether a transition video should be 'F' (funny) or 'S' (scary) is flawed. The current implementation tries to balance the number of 'F' and 'S' videos by appending 'F' or 'S' to `sa` and `sb` lists, but this does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will appear for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Incomplete Handling of '?' Characters**: The program attempts to fill in '?' characters based on the count of already decided 'F' and 'S' transitions, but it does not consider the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type. This results in invalid solutions where the constraint might be violated.

3. **Incorrect Output Format**: The output format should strictly follow the problem's requirements, but the current implementation does not guarantee that the output will meet the specified conditions for all permutations of scenarios.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm that ensures the constraint is met for all possible permutations of scenarios. This typically involves backtracking or a similar combinatorial approach to explore different assignments of 'F' and 'S' values while checking the constraint after each assignment.
