Output State: `n` is an input integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the corresponding input strings; `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the corresponding input strings; `xx` is a list containing n+1 elements, each being a string input from the user; `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`; `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. After the loop executes, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sb` is greater than or equal to the length of `sa`. Each string in `xx` has been modified according to the rules inside the nested loops, replacing '?' with either 'S' or 'F' based on the conditions specified.
