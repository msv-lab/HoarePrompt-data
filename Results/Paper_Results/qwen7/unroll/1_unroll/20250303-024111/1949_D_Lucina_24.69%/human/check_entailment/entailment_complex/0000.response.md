Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly processes the input by counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario pair and storing these counts in lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Identifying Undecided Characters**: The program correctly identifies undecided characters ('?') and categorizes them into two groups: `sa` and `sb`, depending on whether they are more likely to be 'F' or 'S'.

3. **Replacement Logic**:
   - If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the program replaces '?' with 'F' if the current index `i` (or `j`) is within the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise it replaces '?' with 'S'.
   - If `len(sb) > len(sa)`, the program replaces '?' with 'S' if the current index `i` (or `j`) is within the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise it replaces '?' with 'F'.

4. **Ensuring Constraints**: The program ensures that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' are present in any permutation of scenarios. This is achieved by strategically placing 'F' and 'S' in the undecided positions.

5. **Output Generation**: The program generates the final transition video plan by replacing '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the logic described above and prints the result.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem's requirements and constraints correctly. It handles the input processing, identification of undecided characters, and strategic placement of 'F' and 'S' to ensure the constraints are met.

Correctness: **True**
