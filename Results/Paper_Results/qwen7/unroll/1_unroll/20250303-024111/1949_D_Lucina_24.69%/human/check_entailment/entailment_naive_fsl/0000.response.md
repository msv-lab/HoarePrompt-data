Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the transition video plan according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the type of transition videos (funny or scary) for undecided cases ('?') is flawed. 

The program attempts to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type occur for any permutation of the scenarios. However, the implementation does not properly handle the constraints and does not guarantee that the generated plan will satisfy the requirement for all permutations.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
.F?S?
.?F?S
S?.F?
F??.S
S??.?
```

The program's output might look like:

```
.FFFFF
.FFFFF
.SFFFF
FFFFFS
FFFFFS
```

However, for the permutation (1, 3, 2, 4, 5), the sequence of transition videos would be `F S F F S`, which does not violate the constraint. But for the permutation (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the sequence of transition videos would be `F F S F S`, which also does not violate the constraint. However, for the permutation (1, 4, 2, 3, 5), the sequence of transition videos would be `F F S S S`, which violates the constraint because it has 3 consecutive scary videos.

Thus, the program does not correctly generate a valid transition video plan for all permutations of scenarios, making it incorrect.
