Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it returns either an integer `n` or an error message if `t` is out of the specified range.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers: `t` and `n`. It checks if `t` is within the range 1 to 10^4. If `t` is valid, it processes `n` (an integer between 1 and 10^9) and returns `n`. If `t` is invalid (i.e., not within the specified range), it returns an error message indicating that `t` is out of range.
