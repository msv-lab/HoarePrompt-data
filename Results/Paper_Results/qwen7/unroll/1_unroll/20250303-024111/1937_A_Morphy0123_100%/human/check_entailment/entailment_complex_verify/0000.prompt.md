You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Initially, a_i=i for each 1 \le
i \le n .

The operation \texttt{swap}(k) for an integer k \ge 2 is defined as follows:

  * Let d be the largest divisor^\dagger of k which is not equal to k itself. Then swap the elements a_d and a_k . 

Suppose you perform \texttt{swap}(i) for each i=2,3,\ldots, n in this exact
order. Find the position of 1 in the resulting array. In other words, find
such j that a_j = 1 after performing these operations.

^\dagger An integer x is a divisor of y if there exists an integer z such that
y = x \cdot z .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 10^9 ) —
the length of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output the position of 1 in the resulting array.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1
    
    4
    
    5
    
    120240229

Output

    1
    4
    4
    67108864
    
Note

In the first test case, the array is [1] and there are no operations
performed.

In the second test case, a changes as follows:

  * Initially, a is [1,2,3,4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(2) , a changes to [\underline{2},\underline{1},3,4] (the elements being swapped are underlined). 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(3) , a changes to [\underline{3},1,\underline{2},4] . 
  * After performing \texttt{swap}(4) , a changes to [3,\underline{4},2,\underline{1}] . 

Finally, the element 1 lies on index 4 (that is, a_4 = 1 ). Thus, the answer
is 4 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    n_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(n_cases):
        n = int(input())
        
        if n == 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            power = 1
            n = log2(n)
            while power < n:
                power += 1
            if power == n:

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the input values for each case. For each input `n`, if `n` is 1, it will print 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it will print the next power of 2. Otherwise, it will print the current highest power of 2 less than `n`. The number of outputs will be equal to the value of `n_cases`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). For each `n`, if `n` is 1, it prints 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it prints the next power of 2. Otherwise, it prints the highest power of 2 less than `n`. The function reads the number of test cases from user input and repeats the above process for each test case. After processing all test cases, it concludes without returning any value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the `swap` operation as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to find the largest divisor of `k` using a logarithmic approach, which is incorrect for determining the divisor. Instead, it should iterate through possible divisors to find the largest one that is not equal to `k`.

Here is an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input `n = 6`. The initial array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.

- For `swap(2)`, the largest divisor of 2 is 1, so we swap `a_1` and `a_2`, resulting in `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- For `swap(3)`, the largest divisor of 3 is 1, so we swap `a_1` and `a_3`, resulting in `[3, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`.
- For `swap(4)`, the largest divisor of 4 is 2, so we swap `a_2` and `a_4`, resulting in `[3, 4, 2, 1, 5, 6]`.
- For `swap(5)`, the largest divisor of 5 is 1, so we swap `a_1` and `a_5`, resulting in `[5, 4, 2, 1, 3, 6]`.
- For `swap(6)`, the largest divisor of 6 is 3, so we swap `a_3` and `a_6`, resulting in `[5, 4, 6, 1, 3, 2]`.

After all swaps, the position of `1` is `4`, not `64` as the program incorrectly outputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
