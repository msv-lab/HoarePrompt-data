Output State: **`n_cases` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `n_cases` ≤ 10^4.**

The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is now replaced by the fact that `n_cases` is an integer within the same range. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial conditions.
