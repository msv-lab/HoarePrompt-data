Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed based on the input values for each case. For each input `n`, if `n` is 1, it will print 1. If `n` is a power of 2, it will print the next power of 2. Otherwise, it will print the current highest power of 2 less than `n`. The number of outputs will be equal to the value of `n_cases`.
