### Reasoning

The original assessment concluded that the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios for determining if the robot can reach `(2, n)`. While the assessment is generally correct, let's re-evaluate the program more systematically using the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `row1` and `row2` are strings of length `n` consisting of characters `<` and/or `>`.

2. **Loop Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates from `0` to `half_n - 2`.
   - For each `i` in the loop:
     - If `row1[2 * i + 1]` is `<` and either `row2[2 * i]` or `row2[2 * i + 2]` is `<`, the function returns `'No'`.

3. **Final Checks**:
   - After the loop, the function checks if `row1[n - 1]` is `<` and `row2[n - 2]` is `<`.
   - If both conditions are true, the function returns `'No'`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `'Yes'`.

#### Key Points to Validate

1. **Pattern Checking**:
   - The function checks for specific patterns where the robot gets stuck or cannot move forward. However, it does not cover all possible paths the robot might take.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements and down movements.

3. **General Correctness**:
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and input format. However, it may miss some valid paths that allow the robot to reach `(2, n)`.

#### Annotated Code Validation

- **First Loop**:
  - The loop checks if the robot can move left and then get stuck due to specific arrow configurations.
  - This covers some edge cases but misses other valid paths.

- **Final Checks**:
  - The final checks ensure that the robot cannot get stuck in the last column or the second-to-last column.
  - These checks are necessary but do not cover all possible paths.

#### Conclusion

While the function `func_1` does not cover all possible scenarios, it does handle some critical edge cases and ensures that the robot cannot get stuck in certain configurations. The function correctly processes the input and outputs the results for the given constraints.

However, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function does not cover all possible scenarios. The function may miss some valid paths that allow the robot to reach `(2, n)`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is not fully correct because it does not cover all possible paths the robot might take to reach `(2, n)`.
