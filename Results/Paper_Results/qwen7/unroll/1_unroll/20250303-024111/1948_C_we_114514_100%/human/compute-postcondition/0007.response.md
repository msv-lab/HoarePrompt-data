Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but instead uses predefined variables t (an integer between 1 and 10^4), n (an integer between 2 and 2â‹…10^5 and even), row1 (a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'), and row2 (a string of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'). The function returns a value based on the comparison of row1 and row2.**

Note: The actual return value based on the comparison is not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
