Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and two strings `row1` and `row2` (each of length `n` and consisting only of characters '<' and/or '>'). It checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings and returns 'No' if certain invalid configurations are found, otherwise it returns 'Yes'.**
