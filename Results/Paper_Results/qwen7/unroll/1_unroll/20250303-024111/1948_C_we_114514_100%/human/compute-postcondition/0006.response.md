Based on the initial state provided:

- `results` is a list where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop with the respective `n`, `row1`, and `row2` inputs.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string, separated by newline characters (`\n`), and then print this string.

Since the exact values of `n`, `row1`, `row2`, and the function `func_1` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact numerical or string values that will be in the `results` list. However, we know that each element of the `results` list is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)`.

Therefore, the output will be a string where each line corresponds to one of the results from calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` in the loop, separated by newlines.

Output: **a string where each line is the result of func_1(n, row1, row2) for each iteration, separated by newlines**
