The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three inputs: an integer `t` (number of test cases), another integer `n`, and two strings `row1` and `row2` of length `n`. It then calls `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each test case and stores the result. Finally, it prints the results of all test cases, each on a new line.
