The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (number of pairs `(a, b)`), and pairs of positive integers `a` and `b`. For each pair `(a, b)`, it calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the outcome, which is then stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each result in the order they were computed.
