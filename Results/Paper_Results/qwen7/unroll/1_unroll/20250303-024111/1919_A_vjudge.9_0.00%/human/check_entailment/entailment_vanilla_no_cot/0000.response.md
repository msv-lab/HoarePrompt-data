Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. According to the rules of the game, if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. The `func_1` function accurately determines the winner for a single test case, and `func_2` reads multiple test cases, calls `func_1` for each, and prints the results. This matches the problem description and examples provided.
