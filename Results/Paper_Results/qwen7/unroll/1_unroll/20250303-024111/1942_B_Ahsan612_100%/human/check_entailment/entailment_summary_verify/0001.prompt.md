You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

⠀

Farmer John has a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n , where every integer from
0 to n-1 occurs exactly once. He gives Bessie an array a of length n and
challenges her to construct p based on a .

The array a is constructed so that a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) -
p_i , where the \texttt{MEX} of an array is the minimum non-negative integer
that does not appear in that array. For example, \texttt{MEX}(1, 2, 3) = 0 and
\texttt{MEX}(3, 1, 0) = 2 .

Help Bessie construct any valid permutation p that satisfies a . The input is
given in such a way that at least one valid p exists. If there are multiple
possible p , it is enough to print one of them.

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the lengths of p and a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-n \leq a_i \leq n ) — the elements of array a .

It is guaranteed that there is at least one valid p for the given data.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers on a new line, the elements of p .

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    1 1 -2 1 2
    
    5
    
    1 1 1 1 1
    
    3
    
    -2 1 2

Output

    0 1 4 2 3 
    0 1 2 3 4 
    2 0 1 
    
Note

In the first case, p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] is one possible output.

a will then be calculated as a_1 = \texttt{MEX}(0) - 0 = 1 , a_2 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1) - 1 = 1 , a_3 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4) - 4 = -2 , a_4 =
\texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2) - 2 = 1 , a_5 = \texttt{MEX}(0, 1, 4, 2, 3) - 3 = 2 .

So, as required, a will be [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] .

- Program:
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then calculates a list `res` of length `n`, where each element `res[i]` is computed as `mex - ar[i]`, with `mex` being decremented during the calculation. Finally, it prints the list `res` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `ar`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A result list `res` of size `n` is initialized with `None` values.
   - A variable `mex` is initialized to `n`, which represents the MEX value for the current position in the permutation.

3. **Backward Construction:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `ar` using a for loop.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates the corresponding value in the permutation `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It then updates `mex` to be `mex - ar[i]` if this value is greater than the current `mex`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result list `res` as a space-separated string.

### Correctness Check:

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX value should correctly reflect the smallest missing integer in the partial permutation up to that point.
   - The backward construction ensures that each `res[i]` is set to the correct value based on the MEX of the remaining elements.

2. **Update Mechanism:**
   - The update of `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` when `mex > mex - ar[i]` ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted for the next iteration.

3. **Permutation Validity:**
   - Each integer from 0 to `n-1` must appear exactly once in the final permutation.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initial MEX Value:**
   - When `i` starts from `len(ar) - 1` and goes down to 0, the initial `mex` value is `n`. This is correct because initially, no elements are considered, and the MEX is `n`.

2. **MEX Update Logic:**
   - For each `ar[i]`, the MEX value is updated to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex > mex - ar[i]`. This ensures that the MEX value is correctly adjusted based on the current value of `ar[i]`.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The construction process ensures that each `res[i]` is a unique integer between 0 and `n-1` because `mex` is always updated to ensure the correct MEX value for the remaining elements.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where `ar[i]` might be equal to `mex`, ensuring that `mex` is correctly adjusted.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly constructs a valid permutation based on the given array `ar` and the MEX values. The logic for updating `mex` and constructing the permutation is sound and follows the problem constraints.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
