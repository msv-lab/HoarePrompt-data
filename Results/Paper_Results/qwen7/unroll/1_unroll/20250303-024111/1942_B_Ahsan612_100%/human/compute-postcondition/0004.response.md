Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then calculates a list `res` of length `n`, where each element `res[i]` is computed as `mex - ar[i]`, with `mex` being decremented during the calculation. Finally, it prints the list `res` for each test case.**
