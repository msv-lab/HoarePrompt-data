### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems whose sum equals `x`.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over potential divisors of `x` using a loop from `1` to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, it updates `ans` if `i` is greater.
     - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, it updates `ans` if `x // i` is greater.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a multiple of `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - It ensures that the sub-problems' difficulties are positive integers and their sum equals `x`.

4. **GCD Maximization**:
   - By iterating up to `sqrt(x)`, the program efficiently finds the largest possible GCD.
   - The conditions ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

However, there is a subtle issue in the approach. The program assumes that the maximum GCD can always be found by checking both `i` and `x // i`. This assumption is not entirely correct because the GCD of the sub-problems' difficulties might not necessarily be one of these values.

Consider the following example:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  10 3
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  2
  ```
- **Actual Output**: 
  ```
  2
  ```

This example works correctly, but consider another example:
- **Input**: 
  ```
  1
  10 5
  ```
- **Expected Output**: 
  ```
  1
  ```
- **Actual Output**: 
  ```
  2
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly returns `2` instead of `1`. The correct GCD should be `1` because the only way to split `10` into `5` sub-problems with a sum of `10` is to have each sub-problem with difficulty `2`, which gives a GCD of `2`. However, splitting them into `1` and `1` (each sub-problem with difficulty `2`) is not possible since `10 - 5 * 2 = 0` and `0 % 2 == 0` but `10 - 5 * 1 = 5` and `5 % 1 != 0`.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the GCD of `1` is possible, which means checking if `x` is divisible by `n`. If `x % n == 0`, then the GCD is `x // n`. Otherwise, the GCD is the largest divisor found during the iteration.

### Corrected Code:
```python
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        # Check if x is divisible by n
        if x % n == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // n)
        print(ans)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was partially correct but did not account for the edge case where the GCD is `1` and the sum of sub-problems' difficulties must be checked properly. The corrected code addresses this issue.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
