### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of the difficulties of `n` sub-problems whose sum equals `x`.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over potential divisors of `x` using a loop from `1` to `sqrt(x)`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, it updates `ans` if `i` is greater.
     - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, it updates `ans` if `x // i` is greater.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is a multiple of `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.
   - It ensures that the sub-problems' difficulties are positive integers and their sum equals `x`.

4. **GCD Maximization**:
   - By iterating up to `sqrt(x)`, the program efficiently finds the largest possible GCD.
   - The conditions ensure that the sum of the sub-problems' difficulties equals `x`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are the difficulty and number of sub-problems respectively.
  
- **Loop Iteration**:
  - The loop iterates from `1` to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`.
  - For each `i`:
    - Check if `x % i == 0` (i.e., `i` is a divisor of `x`).
    - If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, update `ans` to `max(ans, i)`.
    - If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `x // i`, update `ans` to `max(ans, x // i)`.

- **Conditions**:
  - The conditions `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` ensure that the sub-problems' difficulties are positive integers and their sum equals `x`.
  - Similarly, the conditions `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0` ensure the same for `x // i`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - The program correctly handles the edge cases where `x` is a multiple of `n` by checking both `i` and `x // i`.

- **GCD Maximization**:
  - The loop ensures that the maximum GCD is found by checking all possible divisors up to `sqrt(x)`.

- **Output**:
  - The program prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance (GCD) of the sub-problems' difficulties. It handles all edge cases and follows the problem's requirements accurately.
