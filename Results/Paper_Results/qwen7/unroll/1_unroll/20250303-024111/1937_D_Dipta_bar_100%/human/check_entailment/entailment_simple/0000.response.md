### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves simulating the movement of a pinball on a grid where each cell has a direction ('<' or '>'), and the pinball's direction changes after each move. The goal is to calculate the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the grid size (`n`) and the grid configuration (`s`).
   - The function `func_1(s)` is supposed to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It calculates two arrays, `A` and `B`, which store cumulative sums related to the indices of '>' and '<' characters respectively.
   - These calculations seem to be based on the positions of '>' and '<' characters in the string `s`.
   - The main logic in `func_1(s)` uses these arrays to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid for each starting position.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates over each cell and uses the precomputed arrays `A` and `B` to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic correctly handles the boundary conditions and the direction changes.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundary cells and when there are no '>' or '<' characters in the string.

6. **Output**:
   - The output matches the expected format, providing the time taken for each starting position.

### Conclusion:

The given code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It handles all the necessary computations and edge cases appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
