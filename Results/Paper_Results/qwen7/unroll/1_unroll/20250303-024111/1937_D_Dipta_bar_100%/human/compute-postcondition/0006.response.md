Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list containing integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of indices greater than the previous one encountered, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of '>' characters in `s`, `B` is an empty list**.

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `B`. The variables `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `B` is the only new information added, being an empty list.
