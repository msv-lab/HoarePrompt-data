Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for all cases. Specifically, the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is flawed. Let's consider a few test cases to illustrate the issue:

1. For the input `3` and `"><<"`, the expected output is `3 6 5`. However, the program does not produce this output. Instead, it calculates the time based on a complex formula that does not accurately reflect the movement and inversion rules described in the problem statement.

2. For the input `4` and `"<<<<"`, the expected output is `1 2 3 4`. The program should output these values because the pinball starts at the leftmost position and moves right until it reaches the end. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this simple case.

3. For the input `6` and `<><<<<`, the expected output is `1 4 7 10 8 1`. The program should output these values because the pinball starts at the leftmost position and moves according to the rules. However, the program's logic does not correctly handle this case either.

Given these examples, it is clear that the program does not correctly implement the rules for the pinball's movement and does not produce the expected results for all inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
