Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the value of `t` after executing the code remains within this range, and it is now explicitly an input integer. The precondition that `s` is a binary string with \(1 \leq |s| \leq 500\) is not affected by this code and remains valid.
