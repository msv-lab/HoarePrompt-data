State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 1** 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
2. The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
4. Initially, `i` is set to 0, but after the first iteration, `i` will be 1.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be adjusted to start from 1.
