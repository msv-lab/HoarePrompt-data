You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 1
        flag = False
        j = 0
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 1
        
        flag = False
        
        j = 0
        
        while j < len(s) - 1:
            if s[j] != s[j + 1]:
                count += 1
                if s[j] == '0' and s[j + 1] == '1':
                    flag = True
            j += 1
        
        if flag:
            count -= 1
        
        print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: t is the number of strings processed, and for each string, count is the length of the longest alternating subsequence minus one if there was a transition from '0' to '1' at any point in the string.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of binary strings (up to 500 in number) and calculates the length of the longest alternating subsequence for each string. If there is a transition from '0' to '1' anywhere in the string, it subtracts one from the count. The function outputs the count for each string and the total number of strings processed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is initialized to 1, representing the initial assumption that at least one piece is needed.
   - `flag` is a boolean variable used to track if there is a transition from '0' to '1'.
   - `j` is an index variable starting from 0.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` using a while loop until `j` reaches the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - Inside the loop:
     - If the current character `s[j]` is different from the next character `s[j+1]`, it increments `count` by 1.
     - If the current character is '0' and the next character is '1', it sets `flag` to `True`.
   - After the loop, if `flag` is `True`, it decrements `count` by 1. This adjustment is necessary because the presence of a '0' followed by a '1' indicates that these two characters should be in separate pieces to ensure the final string is sorted.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `count`.

### Testing the Logic:

- **Case 1: "11010"**
  - Initial `count` = 1.
  - Transition found at indices (0, 2): '1' -> '0' -> '1'.
  - `count` becomes 3.
  - No '0' -> '1' transition, so `flag` remains `False`.
  - Output: 3 (Correct).

- **Case 2: "00000000"**
  - Initial `count` = 1.
  - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Case 3: "1"**
  - Initial `count` = 1.
  - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Case 4: "10"**
  - Initial `count` = 1.
  - Transition found at index (0, 1): '1' -> '0'.
  - `count` becomes 2.
  - No '0' -> '1' transition, so `flag` remains `False`.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

- **Case 5: "0001111"**
  - Initial `count` = 1.
  - No transitions, so `count` remains 1.
  - Output: 1 (Correct).

- **Case 6: "0110"**
  - Initial `count` = 1.
  - Transition found at index (0, 1): '0' -> '1'.
  - `count` becomes 2.
  - Another transition found at index (1, 3): '1' -> '0'.
  - `count` becomes 3.
  - '0' -> '1' transition, so `flag` is set to `True`.
  - `count` is adjusted to 2.
  - Output: 2 (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. The adjustments made when encountering a '0' followed by a '1' are necessary and correct.

**Correctness: **True**
