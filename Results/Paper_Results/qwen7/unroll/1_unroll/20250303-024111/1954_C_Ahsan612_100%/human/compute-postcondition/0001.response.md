Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits. For each iteration of the loop, a new string `new` and a new string `new2` are generated based on the comparison of two input strings `a` and `b`. The first string `new` is formed by taking the maximum of corresponding digits from `a` and `b` until a mismatch occurs, then taking the minimum of the mismatched digits and the rest of the digits from both strings. The second string `new2` is formed similarly but with the roles of maximum and minimum reversed. After all iterations, the final `new` and `new2` strings are printed.
