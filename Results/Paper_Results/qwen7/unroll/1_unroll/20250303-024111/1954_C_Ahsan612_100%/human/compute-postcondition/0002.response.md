Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits, each of which is the result of processing two input strings of digits through the given loop. For each position in the strings, the first string (new) contains the maximum value between the corresponding digits of the two input strings if they are not equal at that position or the last digit that was found to be different, otherwise it contains the minimum value. The second string (new2) is the reverse, containing the minimum value if the digits are not equal or the last different digit, otherwise it contains the maximum value.
