The function processes two input strings of equal length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It compares the corresponding digits of the two strings and constructs two new strings based on the comparison results. For each position where the digits are different, the first new string contains the maximum value, and the second new string contains the minimum value. If the digits are the same, the new strings retain the original digits. The function prints these two new strings and does not return any value.
