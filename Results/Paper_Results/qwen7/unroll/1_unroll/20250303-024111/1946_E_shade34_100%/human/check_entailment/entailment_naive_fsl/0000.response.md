Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be related to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, they seem to be implementing some form of extended Euclidean algorithm, which is not relevant to the problem at hand.

To solve the problem, we would need to construct permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums and count the valid permutations. The given code does not implement this logic, making it incorrect for the problem description.
