### Reasoning

The original assessment is inaccurate because it fails to recognize that the provided code does not implement the logic required to solve the main problem. The assessment incorrectly states that the helper functions are not used in the context of solving the problem, when in fact, the core logic for solving the problem is missing entirely.

To properly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Identify the positions of the prefix and suffix maximums.
2. Determine the constraints these maximums impose on the permutation.
3. Count the number of valid permutations that satisfy these constraints.

The given code only contains two helper functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) that deal with modular arithmetic, specifically finding modular inverses. These functions are not used in the context of solving the permutation problem described in the problem statement.

Since the provided code does not contain any logic to solve the main problem, it cannot be considered correct. Therefore, the original assessment is indeed inaccurate.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to solve the main problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
