### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length \(n\) that match given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should handle multiple test cases and output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers and finds the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function calls `func_1` with `b` and \(10^9 + 7\) as arguments, then multiplies the result by `a` and takes the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

3. **Relevance to the Problem**:
   - The Extended Euclidean Algorithm is used to find modular inverses and solve linear Diophantine equations. While these operations are useful in certain contexts, they do not directly help in constructing or counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
   - There is no code that constructs permutations or checks if a given permutation matches the prefix and suffix maximums.

4. **Expected Solution**:
   - To solve the problem, one would typically use combinatorial methods to count the valid permutations. This involves dynamic programming or other combinatorial techniques to ensure that the prefix and suffix maximum constraints are satisfied.
   - The given code does not implement any of these necessary steps.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not solve the given problem. Therefore, the program is indeed incorrect for the problem description.

**Final: False**
