Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two functions `func_1` and `func_2`, but these functions do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires a different approach, such as dynamic programming or combinatorial logic, to correctly count the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions.

The functions `func_1` and `func_2` appear to be related to modular multiplicative inverses and the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which are not directly applicable to the problem at hand. Therefore, the given program is incorrect for solving the specified problem.
