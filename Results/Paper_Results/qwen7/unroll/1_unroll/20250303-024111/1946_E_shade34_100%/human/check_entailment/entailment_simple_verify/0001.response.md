### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length \( n \) that match the given prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should output the count modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Key Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to find the multiplicative inverse of \( a \) modulo \( b \).
   - `func_2(a, b)`: Uses the result from `func_1` to compute \( a^{-1} \mod b \) and returns \( a \times a^{-1} \mod b \).

3. **Usage of Functions**:
   - The main logic of the program uses these functions in a way that suggests it is trying to compute combinations and factorials modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes a list `facts` to store factorials up to \( 200002 \) modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
   - For each test case, it reads the input values \( n \), \( m_1 \), and \( m_2 \), along with the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It checks if the first and last indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are consistent with the boundaries of the permutation.
   - If they are consistent, it computes the number of valid permutations using combinations and factorials.

5. **Combination and Factorial Calculations**:
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to compute modular inverses, which are necessary for combination calculations.
   - It calculates combinations using the formula \( \binom{n}{k} \mod (10^9 + 7) \), which is correctly implemented.

6. **Permutation Counting**:
   - The program correctly handles the constraints and computes the number of valid permutations by considering the gaps between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It ensures that the permutations are counted correctly by multiplying the appropriate combinations and factorials.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximums. It uses modular arithmetic and combinatorial calculations to achieve this. The helper functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used appropriately to handle the modular arithmetic needed for the calculations.
