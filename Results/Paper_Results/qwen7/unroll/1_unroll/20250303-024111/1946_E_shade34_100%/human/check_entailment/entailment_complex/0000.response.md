Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions for prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves combinatorial calculations and modular arithmetic.

2. **Key Components**:
   - **Permutations and Maximums**: A permutation is a sequence of numbers where each number from 1 to `n` appears exactly once. Prefix and suffix maximums are specific positions in the permutation where the value at that position is the largest among the previous or subsequent elements.
   - **Combinatorial Calculations**: The solution uses combinatorial functions to count the number of valid permutations based on the given maximum indices.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - **Factorials Calculation**: The code precomputes factorials up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores them in the `facts` list. This is used for combinatorial calculations.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - **Check Validity**: The code checks if the last index of prefix maximums matches the first index of suffix maximums, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, the answer is 0.
     - **Combinatorial Counting**: The code uses the `func_2` function to perform combinatorial calculations. This function calls `func_1` which performs extended Euclidean algorithm operations.
     - **Modular Arithmetic**: All calculations are performed modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function implements the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `a`. It returns values that are used in combinatorial calculations.

5. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute a value modulo \(10^9 + 7\). It is used to simplify the combinatorial calculations.

6. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The logic in the main part of the code correctly applies combinatorial principles to count the number of valid permutations.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the calculations do not overflow.
   - The checks for validity ensure that only permutations that can possibly satisfy the given conditions are considered.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
