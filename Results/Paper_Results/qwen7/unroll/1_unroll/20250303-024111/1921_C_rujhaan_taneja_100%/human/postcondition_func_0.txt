The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, f, a, and b, followed by a list of n integers. It then checks if the sum of certain transformed elements in the list plus a base value is less than f. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the evaluation of the condition.
