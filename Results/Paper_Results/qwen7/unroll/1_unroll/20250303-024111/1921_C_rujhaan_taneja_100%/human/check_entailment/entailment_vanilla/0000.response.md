### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of messages (`n`), initial charge (`f`), charge consumption per unit of time (`a`), and the charge consumption for turning off and on (`b`). It also correctly parses the list of message times (`arr`).
3. **Charge Calculation Logic**:
   - For the first message, the function checks if the time to send the first message is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`). If it is, the function calculates the charge used as `arr[0] * a`.
   - For subsequent messages, the function checks if the time between consecutive messages is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`). If it is, the function calculates the charge used as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
   - The function stores these charges in `array2`.
4. **Total Charge Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total charge used for sending all messages and turning off/on the phone.
   - It sums the charges from `array2` and adds the charge for turning off and on the phone for the remaining messages (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).
5. **Comparison with Initial Charge**:
   - The function compares the calculated total charge with the initial charge (`f`).
   - If the total charge is less than or equal to `f`, the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the charge used for sending messages and turning off/on the phone seems correct.
- The condition checks for whether the time to send a message is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone are correctly implemented.
- The summation and comparison steps are also correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
