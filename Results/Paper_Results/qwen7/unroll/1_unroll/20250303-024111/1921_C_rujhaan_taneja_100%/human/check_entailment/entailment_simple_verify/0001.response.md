### Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. **Input Parsing**: The function correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of messages (`n`), initial charge (`f`), charge consumption per unit of time (`a`), and the charge consumption for turning off and on (`b`). It also correctly parses the list of message times (`arr`).

3. **Charge Calculation Logic**:
   - For the first message, the function checks if the time to send the first message is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`). If it is, the function calculates the charge used as `arr[0] * a`.
   - For subsequent messages, the function checks if the time between consecutive messages is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone (`b / a`). If it is, the function calculates the charge used as `(arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a`.
   - The function stores these charges in `array2`.

4. **Total Charge Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the total charge used for sending all messages and turning off/on the phone.
   - It sums the charges from `array2` and adds the charge for turning off and on the phone for the remaining messages (`(n - len(array2)) * b`).

5. **Comparison with Initial Charge**:
   - The function compares the calculated total charge with the initial charge (`f`).
   - If the total charge is less than or equal to `f`, the function prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the charge used for sending messages and turning off/on the phone seems correct.
- The condition checks for whether the time to send a message is less than the cost of turning off and on the phone are correctly implemented.
- The summation and comparison steps are also correctly implemented.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic for calculating the charge used for sending messages and turning off/on the phone. Specifically, the function incorrectly assumes that the phone must be turned off and on every time the time difference between messages is less than `b / a`. This assumption is not always correct.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following test case:
- `t = 1`
- `n = 3`, `f = 10`, `a = 1`, `b = 5`
- `arr = [1, 3, 5]`

According to the problem statement, the phone should be turned off and on only when necessary. Here, the time differences are `2` and `2`, which are both greater than `b / a = 5 / 1 = 5`. Therefore, the phone does not need to be turned off and on between messages. The correct calculation would be:
- Charge used for sending messages: `1 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9`
- Total charge: `9 + 0 * 5 = 9` (since no turning off and on is needed)

The function, however, would calculate:
- Charge used for sending messages: `1 * 1 + 3 * 1 + 5 * 1 = 9`
- Charge used for turning off and on: `2 * 5 = 10`
- Total charge: `9 + 10 = 19`

Since `19 > 10`, the function would incorrectly print 'No'.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle the scenario where the time difference between messages is less than `b / a` but does not require turning off and on the phone. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**
