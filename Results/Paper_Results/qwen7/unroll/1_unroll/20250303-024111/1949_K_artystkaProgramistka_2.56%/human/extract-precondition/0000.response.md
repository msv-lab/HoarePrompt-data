Precondition: **num is an integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, and na, nb, nc are non-negative integers satisfying 1 <= na, nb, nc <= n-2 and na + nb + nc = n. sum_a, sum_b, and sum_c are initialized to 0 before calling this function, and group_a, group_b, and group_c are initialized as empty lists before calling this function.**
