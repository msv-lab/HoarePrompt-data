You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, na, nb, and nc are integers such that 1 ≤ na, nb, nc ≤ n-2 and na + nb + nc = n. numbers is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 10^9 for each x_i in numbers.
def func_2(n, na, nb, nc, numbers):
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)
    group_a, group_b, group_c = [], [], []
    sum_a, sum_b, sum_c = 0, 0, 0
    for num in numbers:
        distribute_number(num)
        
    #State: Output State: `na` elements are taken from `numbers` and added to `group_a`, `nb` elements are taken from `numbers` and added to `group_b`, `nc` elements are taken from `numbers` and added to `group_c`. The sum of elements in `group_a` is `sum_a`, the sum of elements in `group_b` is `sum_b`, and the sum of elements in `group_c` is `sum_c`. All elements in `numbers` have been distributed, and the original order of elements in `numbers` has been preserved within their respective groups.
    if func_1(sum_a, sum_b, sum_c) :
        return 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
        #The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c
    else :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts four parameters: n (an integer between 3 and 200,000), na and nb and nc (integers between 1 and n-2 such that their sum equals n), and numbers (a list of n positive integers each between 1 and 10^9). It returns either 'YES' along with three groups of indices (group_a, group_b, group_c) if it's possible to divide the list into three groups with sizes na, nb, and nc respectively, or 'NO' if it's not possible.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'YES', group_a, group_b, group_c

Case_2: The program returns 'NO'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
