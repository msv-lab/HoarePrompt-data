You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        print(count + 1)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        print(count + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and for each input string s, the output is the number of positions where the digit is greater than the next digit plus one.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit in the string `s`, then adds one to this count. Finally, it prints this adjusted count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Counting Violations:**
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second last character (`len(s) - 1`).
   - For each pair of consecutive characters `(s[i], s[i+1])`, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is greater than the next character `s[i+1]`.
   - If this condition is true, it increments the `count` variable.

3. **Output Calculation:**
   - After counting the violations, the program prints `count + 1`. This value is intended to represent the minimum number of pieces required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

### Reasoning:

- **Problem Understanding:**
  - The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts such that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
  - A sorted binary string has all '0's before all '1's.

- **Program Logic:**
  - The program counts the number of times a '1' appears before a '0'. Each such occurrence indicates a point where the string needs to be split.
  - Adding 1 to the count gives the total number of pieces needed because:
    - Each '1' before a '0' requires at least one cut.
    - The last segment will naturally be a sorted part of the string.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the string is already sorted (all '0's followed by all '1's), no cuts are needed, and the count will be 0, resulting in 1 piece.
  - If the string consists entirely of '0's or '1's, no cuts are needed, and the count will be 0, resulting in 1 piece.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of places where a '1' appears before a '0', and then adds 1 to get the minimum number of pieces needed. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
