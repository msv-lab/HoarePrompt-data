Reasoning:
- The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. No subsequence sums to \( k \).
  2. All integers from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) can be represented as a subsequence sum.
- The function `func_14()` is designed to solve this problem. Let's analyze its logic:
  - If \( k = 1 \), it returns '1\n2', which means the sequence is `[2]`. This satisfies the condition because the only possible subsequence sum is 2, and 1 cannot be formed.
  - For \( k > 1 \), it constructs a sequence based on the binary representation of \( n \) and \( k \):
    - It starts with powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).
    - It includes \( k - 1 \) minus the sum of these powers of 2.
    - It includes \( k + 1 \).
    - It includes \( 2k + 1 \).
    - It continues with more powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of \( n \).

This approach ensures that:
- No subsequence sums to \( k \) because the construction avoids direct sums involving \( k \).
- All integers from 1 to \( n \) except \( k \) can be represented as subsequence sums due to the inclusion of appropriate powers of 2 and additional values.

Given that `func_14()` correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence for each test case, and `func_15()` iterates over the test cases and prints the results generated by `func_14()`, the overall program meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
