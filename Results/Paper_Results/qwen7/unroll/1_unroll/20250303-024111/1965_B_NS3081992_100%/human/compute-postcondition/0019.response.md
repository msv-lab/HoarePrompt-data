Output State: `ans` is a list containing the elements [1, 2, 4], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `lk` is the length of `bk`.

This means that after the loop executes all its iterations, `ans` will contain the numbers starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\) (since the loop runs from `i=0` to `lk-2`). The values of `b`, `k`, `l`, `bk`, and `lk` remain unchanged from their initial states.
