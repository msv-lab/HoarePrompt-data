Postcondition: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `b`. If `k` equals 1, then `ans` is `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. Otherwise, `ans` is extended to include elements from `2 ** lk` up to `2 ** (l - 1)`, where `lk` is the length of the binary representation of `k` and `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. All other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`) remain unchanged.
