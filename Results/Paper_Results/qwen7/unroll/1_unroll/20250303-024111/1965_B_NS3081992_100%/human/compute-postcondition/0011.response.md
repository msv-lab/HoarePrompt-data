Output State: `ans` is [2, 3, 4, 8], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`.

Explanation: The loop starts with `i` set to 2 and runs until `i` is less than `l`. For each iteration, it appends `2 ** i` to `ans`. Since `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, and the loop runs from 2 to `l-1`, it appends `2^2`, `2^3`, ..., `2^(l-1)` to `ans`. Given the initial `ans` is `[2, 3]`, after the loop, `ans` becomes `[2, 3, 4, 8]`. The other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, and `n`) remain unchanged.
