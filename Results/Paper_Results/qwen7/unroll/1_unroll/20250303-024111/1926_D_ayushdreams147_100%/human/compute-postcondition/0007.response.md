Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It calculates and returns the number of unique pairs of integers in the list `a` such that one integer is the bitwise complement of the other. After executing, the function sets `res` to the count of these unique pairs, makes `count` an empty dictionary, and leaves `n` unchanged.**
