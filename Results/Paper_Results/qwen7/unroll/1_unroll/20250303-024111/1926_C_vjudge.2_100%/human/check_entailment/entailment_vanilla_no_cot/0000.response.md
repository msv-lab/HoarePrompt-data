Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the problem:

1. **Initialization and Array Size**: The array `pd` is initialized to a fixed size based on `N`, which is set to `int(2 * 100000.0) + 1`. This is unnecessarily large and not optimal. Instead, we should calculate the sum of digit sums dynamically without precomputing for such a large range.

2. **Dynamic Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum of digit sums is incorrect. The program tries to precompute the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to `N`, but this approach is inefficient and unnecessary. We need to compute the sum of digit sums directly for each test case.

3. **Efficiency**: Given the constraints (e.g., `t` can be up to \(10^4\) and `n` can be up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\)), precomputing the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to `2 \cdot 10^5` is not feasible within the time limit.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(1, n + 1):
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))
        total_sum += digit_sum
    return total_sum

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))

func()
```

This version correctly calculates the sum of digit sums for each test case dynamically, ensuring efficiency and correctness.
