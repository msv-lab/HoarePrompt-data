Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program simply counts the occurrences of the substrings "map" and "pie" in the string `s` and prints their sum. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to eliminate both "map" and "pie" substrings from the string.

The current implementation does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions. For example, in the test case "mmapnapie", the program would count two occurrences of "map" and one of "pie", resulting in a total of 3 deletions. However, the optimal solution only requires deleting 2 characters ("m" and "e") to make the string "mmapnapie" beautiful.

Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
