Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the initial state**: The initial state is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute based on the input value provided by `int(input())`. This means the loop will run exactly `t` times.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that the input value matches the initial state of `t`. Therefore, the input value must be equal to `t`.

5. **Final state after adjustment**: The state should reflect that the input value is `t`, and since `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, the input value must be within \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to match the input value with `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and the input value must be equal to `t`**
