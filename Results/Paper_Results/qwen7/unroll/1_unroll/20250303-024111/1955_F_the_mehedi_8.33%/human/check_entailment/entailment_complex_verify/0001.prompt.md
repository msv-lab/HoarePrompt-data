You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200), representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `cnt` after all iterations of the loop have finished, which is the sum of 1 for each instance where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, plus the floor division of each count by 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates and prints the total count, which includes 1 for each instance where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are equal and odd, plus half the count of each number rounded down.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Objective**: Determine the maximum number of times Bob can win.
2. **Winning Condition**: Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.
3. **Sequence Composition**: The sequence is composed of `p_1` ones, `p_2` twos, `p_3` threes, and `p_4` fours.
4. **Optimal Strategy**: Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.

### Given Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case.
2. **Reading Input**: For each test case, it reads four integers representing the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
3. **Count Initialization**: A variable `cnt` is initialized to 0.
4. **Initial Check**: It checks if `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` are equal and odd. If true, it increments `cnt` by 1.
5. **Loop Through Counts**: It iterates through the counts of ones, twos, and threes, adding `math.floor(x / 2)` to `cnt`.
6. **Output**: It prints the value of `cnt`.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The condition `if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:` is checking if the counts of ones, twos, and threes are equal and odd. This does not directly relate to the XOR operation and the optimal strategy for Bob.
   - The loop `for x in a:` only considers the counts of ones, twos, and threes, but it should consider all elements in the list `a` which includes the count of fours as well.
   - The addition of `math.floor(x / 2)` is not relevant to the problem's requirement to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **XOR Consideration**:
   - The problem requires calculating the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. The current logic does not account for this.

### Correct Approach
To correctly solve the problem, we need to ensure that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. This involves:
- Counting the parity (odd/even) of the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
- Ensuring that the total number of ones and threes (which have odd XOR results) is even, and the total number of twos and fours (which have even XOR results) is odd.

### Corrected Program
Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones = a[0]
        twos = a[1]
        threes = a[2]
        fours = a[3]

        # Calculate the number of wins for Bob
        bob_wins = min(ones + threes, twos + fours)

        print(bob_wins)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
