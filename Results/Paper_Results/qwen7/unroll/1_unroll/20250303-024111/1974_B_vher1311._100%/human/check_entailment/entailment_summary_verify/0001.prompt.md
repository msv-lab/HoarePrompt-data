You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    return ''.join((mapping[char] for char in encoded))



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string where each character in `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character based on a specific mapping. This mapping is defined such that characters in the sorted unique set of `encoded` (in ascending order) map to characters in the same set (in descending order).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index to iterate through the list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Constructing the Auxiliary String `r`:**
     - `r` is constructed by taking the sorted unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
     - This ensures that `r` contains all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
   - **Creating the Mapping:**
     - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - **Decoding the Encoded String:**
     - The encoded string `b` is decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

### Verification:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, ensuring that the input is handled efficiently.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to construct `r` and create the mapping is correct.
   - The mapping is used to replace each character in the encoded string `b`, resulting in the original string `s`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
