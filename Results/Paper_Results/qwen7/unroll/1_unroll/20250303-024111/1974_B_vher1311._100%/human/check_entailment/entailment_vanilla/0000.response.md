Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string according to the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It initializes an index to iterate through the list.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the length `n` of the encoded string `b`.
   - It then processes the encoded string `b` to decode it.

3. **Decoding Function (`func_1`):**
   - **Constructing the Auxiliary String `r`:**
     - `r` is constructed by taking the sorted unique characters of the encoded string `b`.
     - This ensures that `r` contains all distinct characters of `b` in alphabetical order.
   - **Creating the Mapping:**
     - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding symmetric character from the end of `r`.
   - **Decoding the Encoded String:**
     - The encoded string `b` is decoded by replacing each character with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

### Verification:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads and processes multiple test cases, ensuring that the input is handled efficiently.

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - The logic to construct `r` and create the mapping is correct.
   - The mapping is used to replace each character in the encoded string `b`, resulting in the original string `s`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as single-character strings and strings with repeated characters correctly.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
