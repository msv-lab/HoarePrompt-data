Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string but actually encodes it instead. This is because the function `func_1` is designed to encode the string according to the given rules, not decode it. To correctly decode the string, you need to reverse the process. Here's how you can modify the program to decode the string:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
index = 0
t = int(data[index])
index += 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    b = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(b))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    decoded = ''
    for char in encoded:
        decoded += mapping.get(char, char)  # Use get to handle characters not in r
    return decoded
```

In this corrected version, the `func_1` function creates a mapping from each character in `r` to its corresponding symmetric character and then uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b`. The `get` method is used to handle any characters in `b` that might not be in `r` (though the problem guarantees that all characters in `b` will be in `r`).
