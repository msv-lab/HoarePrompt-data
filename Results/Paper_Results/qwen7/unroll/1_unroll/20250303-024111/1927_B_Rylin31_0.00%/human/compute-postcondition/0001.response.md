Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, l is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ l ≤ 2⋅10^5; array is a list of l non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < l, representing the trace of the string after reversing and counting occurrences; ans is a list of characters derived from the alphabet list based on the counted occurrences; the final output is a string formed by joining the elements of ans.
