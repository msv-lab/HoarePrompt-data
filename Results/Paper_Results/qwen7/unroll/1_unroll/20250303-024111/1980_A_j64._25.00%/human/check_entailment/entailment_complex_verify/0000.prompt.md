You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the number of missing characters for each test case. For each test case, it checks the frequency of each character in a given string `a`. If the frequency of any character is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds this difference to the `missing` count. This count is then appended to the `results` list. The function returns a list `results` containing these counts for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that each of the `m` rounds has at least one problem of each difficulty level. Here's a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Frequency Calculation**: The program correctly counts the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using the `freq` array.
2. **Missing Problems Calculation**: For each difficulty level, the program determines how many more problems are needed to meet the requirement of having at least one problem per round. This is done by calculating `max(0, m - f)` for each difficulty level, where `f` is the frequency of the difficulty level.
3. **Summing Missing Problems**: The total number of missing problems is the sum of the missing problems for each difficulty level.

Given the constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5), the program handles all possible inputs correctly. The provided test cases also validate this:

- **Test Case 1**: `n = 10`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'` -> Needs 2 problems ('A' and 'F').
- **Test Case 2**: `n = 10`, `m = 2`, `a = 'BGECDCBDED'` -> Needs 5 problems (2 'A's, 2 'F's, and 1 'E').
- **Test Case 3**: `n = 9`, `m = 1`, `a = 'BBCDEFFGG'` -> Needs 1 problem ('A').

Since the program correctly handles all the provided test cases and the logic is sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
