Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases and the test cases themselves.
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case, calculates the frequency of each difficulty level, and determines the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level to meet the requirement of `m` rounds.
3. The logic for calculating the number of missing problems is correct. It checks how many more problems are needed for each difficulty level by subtracting the current frequency from `m` and taking the maximum of 0 and the result.
4. The final results are correctly calculated and returned.

Given the provided code matches the problem description and the logic is sound, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
