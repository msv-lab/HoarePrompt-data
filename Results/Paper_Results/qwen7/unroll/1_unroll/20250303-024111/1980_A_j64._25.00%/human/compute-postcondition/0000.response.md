Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: `n` (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 50), `m` (an integer such that 1 <= m <= 5), and `a` (a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G'), and a function definition is provided to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.**

The code defines a function without executing it, so the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The function takes `t` and `test_cases` as arguments but does not modify them within the function body. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `t` and `test_cases`, along with the function definition.
