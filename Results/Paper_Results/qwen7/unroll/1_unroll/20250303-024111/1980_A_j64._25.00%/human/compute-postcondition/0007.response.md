Functionality: **The function calculates the number of missing characters for each test case. For each test case, it checks the frequency of each character in a given string `a`. If the frequency of any character is less than `m`, it calculates the difference and adds this difference to the `missing` count. This count is then appended to the `results` list. The function returns a list `results` containing these counts for all test cases.**
