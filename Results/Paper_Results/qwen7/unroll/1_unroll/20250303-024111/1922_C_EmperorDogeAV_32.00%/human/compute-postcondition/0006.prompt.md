You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Each coordinate a_i satisfies 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Additionally, there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i representing the indices of the cities for which the minimum number of coins to travel between them needs to be calculated, and 1 <= m <= 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, depending on which difference is smaller.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, depending on which difference is smaller.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, whichever is smaller.

```

Return Postconditions: `prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, depending on which difference is smaller.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
