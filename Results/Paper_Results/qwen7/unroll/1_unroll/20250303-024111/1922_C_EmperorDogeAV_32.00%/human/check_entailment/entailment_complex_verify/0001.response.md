### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - The cost includes traveling to the closest city (cost = 1) and traveling directly between any two cities (cost = distance).

2. **Key Components:**
   - `func_1` function calculates the cost to travel to the next closest city.
   - `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` arrays store these costs.
   - `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` are prefix sums of `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

3. **Analysis of the Code:**
   - The code reads the input correctly and processes each test case.
   - `func_1` is intended to compute the cost to travel to the next closest city but seems to be implemented incorrectly.
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because:
     - It uses `-99999999` and `99999999` as placeholders, which might not work as expected.
     - It doesn't properly handle the closest city logic.
   - The prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`) are computed correctly.
   - The queries are processed correctly using the prefix sums.

4. **Testing with Example:**
   - Let's test the `func_1` function with the example provided:
     - Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
     - Expected output for `func_1` should be `[8, 4, 3, 5]` (costs to reach the next closest city).
     - The actual output is incorrect due to the flawed logic.

5. **Review of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to determine the cost to travel to the next closest city. However, the logic inside the function is incorrect. Specifically:
     - The variable `back` is initialized to `-99999999`, which is an arbitrary large negative value. This value will always be less than any actual city coordinate, leading to incorrect comparisons.
     - Similarly, `forward` is initialized to `99999999`, which is an arbitrary large positive value. This value will always be greater than any actual city coordinate, leading to incorrect comparisons.
     - The logic for determining the closest city is flawed because it only considers the next city and the previous city without considering the actual distances.

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - To correctly determine the closest city, we need to compare the distances to the next and previous cities and choose the minimum.
   - A better approach would be to iterate through the list and for each city, determine the closest city by comparing distances to the next and previous cities.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The main issue lies in the `func_1` function, which does not correctly compute the closest city costs.
   - The rest of the code handles the queries correctly once the costs are computed.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because the `func_1` function is flawed.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the `func_1` function. Therefore, the final evaluation is **False**.
