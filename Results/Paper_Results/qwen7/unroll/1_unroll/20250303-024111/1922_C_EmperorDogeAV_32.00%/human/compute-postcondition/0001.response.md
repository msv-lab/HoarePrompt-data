Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` is used as the loop counter. It starts from 0 and goes up to `n-2` (since the loop runs `n-1` times).
   - The variable `n` is the length of the list `cities`, and it must be at least 2 (as given in the problem statement).

3. **Initial state of the variables**:
   - `cities` is a list of `n` integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `prog_cities` is a list of `n-1` zeros.

4. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 0` and runs until `i = n-2`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and `n` is within the required range.
   - The value of `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop, and `n` should be the length of the `cities` list.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` should be the length of the `cities` list.

Therefore, the final state adjustment is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of the `cities` list**.
