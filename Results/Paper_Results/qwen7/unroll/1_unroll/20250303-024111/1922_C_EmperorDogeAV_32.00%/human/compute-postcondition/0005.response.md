Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and returns a list `prog_cities` where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, whichever is smaller.**
