Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or 0 based on the condition that the difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate is smaller than the difference between the current city's coordinate and its previous city's coordinate. If the condition is met, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference.
