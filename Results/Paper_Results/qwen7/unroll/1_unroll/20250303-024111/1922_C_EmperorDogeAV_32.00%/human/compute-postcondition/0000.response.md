Output State: **`cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `prog_cities` is a list of n-1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `prog_cities` with `n-1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `cities` or `n`. Therefore, the list `cities` remains unchanged, and `n` remains a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. The new variable `prog_cities` is initialized as a list of n-1 zeros.
