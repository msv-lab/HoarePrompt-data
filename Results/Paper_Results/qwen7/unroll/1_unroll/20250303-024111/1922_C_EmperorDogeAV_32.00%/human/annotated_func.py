#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5. Each coordinate a_i satisfies 0 <= a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n <= 10^9. Additionally, there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i representing the indices of the cities for which the minimum number of coins to travel between them needs to be calculated, and 1 <= m <= 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order; `prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, depending on which difference is smaller.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, depending on which difference is smaller.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of city coordinates in ascending order and returns a new list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the current city's coordinate and its next city's coordinate, whichever is smaller.
