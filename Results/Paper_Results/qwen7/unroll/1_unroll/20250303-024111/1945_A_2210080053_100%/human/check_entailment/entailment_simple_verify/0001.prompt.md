You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The organizing committee plans to take the participants of the Olympiad on a
hike after the tour. Currently, the number of tents needed to be taken is
being calculated. It is known that each tent can accommodate up to 3 people.

Among the participants, there are a introverts, b extroverts, and c
universals:

  * Each introvert wants to live in a tent alone. Thus, a tent with an introvert must contain exactly one person — only the introvert himself. 
  * Each extrovert wants to live in a tent with two others. Thus, the tent with an extrovert must contain exactly three people. 
  * Each universal is fine with any option (living alone, with one other person, or with two others). 

The organizing committee respects the wishes of each participant very much, so
they want to fulfill all of them.

Tell us the minimum number of tents needed to be taken so that all
participants can be accommodated according to their preferences. If it is
impossible to accommodate the participants in a way that fulfills all the
wishes, output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the descriptions of the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single line containing three integers a , b ,
c (0 \le a, b, c \le 10^9 ) — the number of introverts, extroverts, and
universals, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of tents, or
-1 if it is impossible to accommodate the participants.

Note

In the first test case, 1 tent will be given to the introverts, 1 tent will be
shared by two extroverts and one universal, and the last tent will be shared
by two universals. In total, 3 tents are needed.

In the second test case, three extroverts will take 1 tent, and 1 tent will be
taken by an introvert. Then, one extrovert and one universal will be left.
This extrovert will not be able to live with two others.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, where for each iteration, b is updated to b + c, and the print statement outputs (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]. After all iterations, the values of a, b, and c for each test case are determined based on the operations performed within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which is equivalent to reading lines from stdin starting from the second line (skipping the first line).

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - For each line, it splits the string into three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

3. **Adjusting Extroverts and Universals:**
   - The line `(a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())` parses the input.
   - The line `b += c` adds the number of universals to the number of extroverts. This adjustment is done because each extrovert requires a full tent of 3 people, and universals can fill any remaining spots.

4. **Calculating Tents:**
   - The expression `a - -b // 3` calculates the number of tents needed:
     - `-b // 3` computes the integer division of \(b\) by 3, which gives the maximum number of full tents that can be filled by extroverts and universals.
     - `a - -b // 3` subtracts this value from the number of introverts, giving the remaining number of introverts who need individual tents.
   - The expression `(-1, -1)[c < b % 3]` checks if there are enough universals to fill the remaining spots in the last tent:
     - `b % 3` gives the remainder when \(b\) is divided by 3, indicating how many spots are left in the last tent.
     - `c < b % 3` checks if there are enough universals to fill these remaining spots.
     - If there are enough universals, it returns 0; otherwise, it returns -1.

5. **Output:**
   - The result is printed for each test case.

### Correctness Check

- **Handling Introverts:**
  - Each introvert needs a separate tent, so the number of introverts directly contributes to the number of tents needed.
  
- **Handling Extroverts and Universals:**
  - Each extrovert and universal together can fill a tent of 3 people. By adding the number of universals to the number of extroverts, we ensure that we can maximize the use of tents.
  - The logic correctly handles the distribution of remaining spots in the last tent.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - If the number of universals is less than the remainder when the adjusted number of extroverts is divided by 3, it is impossible to fully accommodate everyone, and the program correctly outputs -1.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. Therefore, the program is correct.
