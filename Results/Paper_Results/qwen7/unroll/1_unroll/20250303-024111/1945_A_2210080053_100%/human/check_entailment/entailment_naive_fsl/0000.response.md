Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the allocation of tents for introverts, extroverts, and universals. Specifically, the program incorrectly combines the number of extroverts and universals before attempting to allocate tents. This approach fails to consider the specific needs of introverts who require individual tents.

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: `1 2 3` (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals)

According to the problem description:
- 1 tent for the introvert.
- 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal (since 2 extroverts can share a tent with 1 universal).
- 1 additional tent for the remaining 2 universals.

So, the total number of tents required is 3.

However, the program attempts to combine the number of extroverts and universals before allocating tents. Here's how it fails:
- `(a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)`
- `b += c` results in `b = 5`
- `(a - -b // 3)` calculates `1 - -5 // 3`, which simplifies to `1 - -1 = 2` (incorrect).

Thus, the program outputs 2 instead of 3, indicating it does not correctly allocate the tents as per the problem description.
