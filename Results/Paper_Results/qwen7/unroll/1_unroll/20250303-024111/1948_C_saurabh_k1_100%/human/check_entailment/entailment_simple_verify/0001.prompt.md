You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid respectively.

                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4; for each value of `t`, there is a corresponding `n` and two strings `a` and `b` such that after executing the loop, if for every `n` and corresponding `a`, `b`, the condition `i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is never met for any odd index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`, then 'yes' is printed; otherwise, 'No' is printed for that particular `n`, `a`, and `b`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, the first row of arrows `a`, and the second row of arrows `b`.

2. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program iterates through every odd-indexed column (i.e., `i` starting from 1 with a step of 2).
   - For each odd-indexed column `i`, it checks two conditions:
     - If the arrow at position `i` in the first row (`a[i]`) is `<` and the arrow at position `i+1` in the second row (`b[i+1]`) is also `<`.
     - Or if the arrow at position `i` in the first row (`a[i]`) is `<` and the arrow at position `i-1` in the second row (`b[i-1]`) is also `<`.

3. **Printing Result:**
   - If any of these conditions are met, the program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop.
   - If none of the conditions are met for any odd-indexed column, the program prints 'yes'.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Problem Constraints:
- The grid has 2 rows and `n` columns.
- Arrows point either left (`<`) or right (`>`).
- The robot starts at `(1, 1)` and must end at `(2, n)`.
- The robot can only move within the grid and follow the arrows.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Odd-Indexed Columns Check:**
   - The program only checks odd-indexed columns, which means it skips even-indexed columns entirely.
   - This is problematic because the robot's movement depends on both the current and the next column's arrows.

2. **Movement Logic:**
   - The logic assumes that if an arrow points left or right, the robot will move accordingly.
   - However, the program does not account for the actual movement path the robot takes, only checking if certain conditions are met at specific columns.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the robot can move to the next row and follow the arrows correctly.
   - It only checks if the arrows align in a specific pattern at certain columns, which is insufficient to determine if the robot can reach `(2, n)`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It fails to account for the actual movement of the robot and only checks a subset of conditions that are not sufficient to determine if the robot can reach the target cell.
