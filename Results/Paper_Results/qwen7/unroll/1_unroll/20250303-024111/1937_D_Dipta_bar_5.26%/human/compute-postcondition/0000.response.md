Output State: **s is a string of length n, n is the length of the string s, consisting only of characters '<' and '>'**.

Explanation: The code `n = len(s)` calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to the variable `n`. The string `s` and its content remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated value of `n`, which is now the length of the string `s`.
