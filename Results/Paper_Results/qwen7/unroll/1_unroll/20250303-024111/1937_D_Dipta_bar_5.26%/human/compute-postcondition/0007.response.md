Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting only of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions '>' encountered up to that point, adjusted by the number of previous '>' positions, `idx_A` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s`, `idx_B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_B = []` initializes `idx_B` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for these variables while updating `idx_B` to be an empty list.
