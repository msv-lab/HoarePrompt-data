Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Arrays a and b are lists of integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_j ≤ 10^6 for all i and j. The sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.**
