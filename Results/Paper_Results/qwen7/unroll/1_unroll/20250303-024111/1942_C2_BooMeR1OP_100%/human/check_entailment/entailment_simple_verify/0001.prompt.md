You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `x`, and `y`.
   - It also reads the indices of the vertices chosen by Bessie and stores them in a list `a`.

2. **Initial Calculation:**
   - The initial answer `ans` is set to `x - 2`. This is because a polygon with `x` vertices can form at most `x - 2` triangles using non-intersecting diagonals.

3. **Handling Adjacent Vertices:**
   - The program checks for adjacent vertices in the sorted list `a` and increments `ans` if a vertex and its immediate next vertex (considering circular nature) are not in the set `st` (set of chosen vertices). This step ensures that we can form additional triangles by adding one more vertex between two existing chosen vertices.

4. **Separating Gaps into Odd and Even:**
   - The program separates the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices into odd and even categories.
   - This separation helps in deciding how many additional vertices can be added to maximize the number of triangles.

5. **Adding Vertices for Odd Gaps:**
   - For each odd gap, the program checks if there are enough remaining choices (`y`) to add half of the gap. If so, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and reduces `y` accordingly.
   - If not, it adds the remaining choices to `ans` and sets `y` to zero.

6. **Adding Vertices for Even Gaps:**
   - Similar to the odd gaps, for each even gap, the program checks if there are enough remaining choices (`y`) to add half of the gap. If so, it adds the entire gap to `ans` and reduces `y` accordingly.
   - If not, it adds the remaining choices to `ans` and sets `y` to zero.

7. **Outputting Result:**
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly handle the problem requirements. Here’s why:

- The initial calculation of `x - 2` for the base number of triangles is correct.
- The handling of adjacent vertices ensures that potential triangles are considered.
- The separation of gaps into odd and even and the subsequent addition of vertices is a valid approach to maximize the number of triangles.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
