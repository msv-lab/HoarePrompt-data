### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to implement a function `func_2` that performs the "balanced shuffle" operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. The balanced shuffle operation involves calculating the balance of each prefix, sorting based on this balance, and then reconstructing the sequence.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function is not used in the main logic but seems to be a helper function for sorting. It compares two `BalanceInfo` objects based on their balance and position.
   - **Function `func_2`**:
     - **Initialization**: 
       - `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
       - `balance_info` is initialized as an empty list to store `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - `balance` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the current balance.
     - **Building Balance Info**:
       - A loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
       - For each character, a `BalanceInfo` object is created and appended to `balance_info`.
       - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it's ')', the balance is decremented.
     - **Sorting**:
       - `balance_info` is sorted using a lambda function that sorts based on the balance and position in descending order for tie-breaking.
     - **Reconstructing the Result**:
       - The sorted `balance_info` is used to construct the result string by joining the characters from the `BalanceInfo` objects.
       - The result is printed.

3. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly calculates the balance of each prefix and stores it along with the position and character.
   - The sorting logic ensures that the sequence is sorted based on the specified criteria.
   - The reconstruction of the result sequence is done correctly by joining the characters from the sorted `BalanceInfo` objects.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
