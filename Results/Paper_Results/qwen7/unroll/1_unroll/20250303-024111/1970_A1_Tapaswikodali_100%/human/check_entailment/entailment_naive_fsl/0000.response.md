Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not used anywhere in the program, and the sorting logic in `func_2` does not correctly handle the balancing of parentheses sequences.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `(()(()))`. According to the problem description, the balanced shuffle operation should produce `()(()())`. However, the current implementation does not produce this output. Instead, it sorts the balance information and constructs the result string, but it does not ensure that the resulting string maintains the correct balance properties as specified.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the balance and positions for each character.
2. **Sorting**: The sorting is done based on the balance and position, but the sorting itself does not guarantee that the resulting sequence will be balanced as required.
3. **Result Construction**: The characters are joined into a string based on the sorted balance and position, but this does not ensure that the resulting sequence is balanced.

Given these points, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, and thus the correctness is **False**.
