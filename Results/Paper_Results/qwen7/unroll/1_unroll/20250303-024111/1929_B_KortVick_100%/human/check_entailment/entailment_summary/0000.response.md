Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Problem Requirements**: 
   - We need to color the minimum number of cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - The total number of diagonals in an \( n \times n \) grid is \( 4n - 2 \).

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \).
   - It checks if \( 4n - 2 \) equals \( k \).
     - If true, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \).
     - Otherwise, it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \).

3. **Analysis**:
   - When \( 4n - 2 = k \):
     - The formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) is correct because each diagonal would ideally need one cell to be colored, and since there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals, we need \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \) cells. However, the formula simplifies to \( \frac{4n - 2}{2} + 1 = 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \), but since \( k = 4n - 2 \), the formula \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \) directly gives \( 2n - 1 + 1 = 2n \), which is correct.
   - When \( 4n - 2 \neq k \):
     - The formula \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \) is used, which correctly rounds up to the nearest integer, ensuring the minimum number of cells needed to satisfy the condition.

Given the examples and the logical steps, the program correctly implements the solution for both scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
