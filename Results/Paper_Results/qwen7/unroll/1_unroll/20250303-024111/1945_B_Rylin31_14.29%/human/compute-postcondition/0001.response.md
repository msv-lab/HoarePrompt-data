Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop `for i in range(t)` will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and the condition is `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure `t` is at least 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be at least 1.

**State: **`t` must be at least 1**
