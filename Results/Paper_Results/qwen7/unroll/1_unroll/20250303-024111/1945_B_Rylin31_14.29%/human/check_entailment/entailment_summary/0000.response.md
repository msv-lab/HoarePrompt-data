Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem statement and the example provided.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Variable Initialization**: It initializes variables `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
3. **Calculation of `mn`**: The variable `mn` is calculated as the minimum of `a` and `b` plus `m`. This part is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and ensures neither `a` nor `b` is 1. However, this condition is not necessary for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Instead, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the interval where the maximum number of fireworks can be seen simultaneously.
5. **Formula for Maximum Fireworks**: The formula used in the program is incorrect. The correct approach should involve calculating the LCM of `a` and `b` and then using it to determine the number of fireworks visible at any given time.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, the condition check and the formula used are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
