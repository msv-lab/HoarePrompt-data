Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the key parts of the program:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation of `mn`**: The variable `mn` is defined as `min(a, b) + m`. This calculation is correct because it represents the smallest interval within which fireworks from both installations could overlap in visibility.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` and ensures that neither `a` nor `b` is 1. If this condition is met, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly handles all test cases as described in the problem statement and produces the expected output.

Given the logical steps and the correct implementation of the problem requirements, the provided code accurately solves the problem as stated.

Correctness: **True**
