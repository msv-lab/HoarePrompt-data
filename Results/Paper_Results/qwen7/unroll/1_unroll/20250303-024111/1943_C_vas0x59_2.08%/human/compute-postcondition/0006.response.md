Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its corresponding index's connected indices after processing all the edges provided through user input, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from node 0, `a` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `a = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling the function `func_1` with argument `d` to the variable `a`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `a`. However, we know that `d` is the result of BFS starting from node 0, and all other variables retain their initial states.
