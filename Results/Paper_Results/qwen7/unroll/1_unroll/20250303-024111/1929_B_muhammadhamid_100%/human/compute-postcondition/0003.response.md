Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers within specified ranges. It returns a value based on the conditions defined by n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with specific constraints on their values. The function then processes these parameters to produce a result, though the exact nature of the result (what it returns) is not detailed here.
