Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to verify if it correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded for each test case.

1. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For \( n > 52 \): The formula `word += alphabet[n - 53] + 'zz'` suggests that the first character is determined by \( n - 53 \). This is correct because the maximum possible sum for two 'z's (26 + 26 = 52) plus the minimum third character ('a' = 1) is 53.
   - For \( 26 < n \leq 52 \): The formula `word += 'a' + alphabet[n - 28] + 'z'` suggests that the second character is determined by \( n - 28 \). This is correct because the maximum possible sum for 'a' and 'z' (1 + 26 = 27) plus the minimum third character ('a' = 1) is 28, and the first character is always 'a'.
   - For \( n \leq 26 \): The formula `word += 'aa' + alphabet[n - 3]` suggests that the third character is determined by \( n - 3 \). This is correct because the maximum possible sum for 'aa' (1 + 1 = 2) plus the minimum second character ('a' = 1) is 3, and the first two characters are always 'a'.

2. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - The constructed words are indeed the lexicographically smallest possible words for each \( n \) because the program ensures that the first non-'a' character is chosen as early as possible.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases correctly, ensuring that the smallest possible word is generated for each \( n \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word for each test case based on the provided rules.

Correctness: **True**
