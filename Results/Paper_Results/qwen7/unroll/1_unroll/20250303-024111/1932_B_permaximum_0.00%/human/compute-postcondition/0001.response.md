Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `t` and the range function. The variable `t` is used as the argument to the `range` function.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is defined as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop requires `t` to be greater than 0, we need to ensure that `t` meets this condition. Given the initial state where `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than 0.

4. **Formulate the Final State**: The only variable that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**.
