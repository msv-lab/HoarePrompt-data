Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur sequentially according to the given problem description. For each test case, the program iterates through the periodicities of the signs and updates the current year by adding the appropriate value to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. This approach ensures that the year calculation is correct for all given test cases and potential inputs within the specified constraints.
