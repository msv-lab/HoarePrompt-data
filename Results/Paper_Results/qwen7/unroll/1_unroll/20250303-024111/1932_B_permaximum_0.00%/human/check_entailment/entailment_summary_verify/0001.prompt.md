You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `year` based on the input list `a`, where `year` is incremented by the minimum of itself and each element in the list `a`. Finally, it prints the calculated `year` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when all `n` signs will occur sequentially.
   - Each sign occurs every `a_i` years, and the next sign can only start occurring after the previous one has occurred.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the number of signs, and a list of periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it updates `year` by adding `year % ai or ai` to it.

3. **Explanation of the Logic:**
   - `year % ai` gives the remainder when `year` is divided by `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is 0, it means `year` is a multiple of `ai`, and we need to add `ai` to `year` to ensure it's the next multiple of `ai`.
   - If `year % ai` is not 0, it means `year` is not a multiple of `ai`, and we need to add `ai - (year % ai)` to `year` to get the next multiple of `ai`.

4. **Verification with Example:**
   - For the first test case: `a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
     - Start with `year = 0`.
     - Add 3 to `year` (since `0 % 3 == 0`), `year = 3`.
     - Add 2 to `year` (since `3 % 2 != 0`), `year = 5`.
     - Add 4 to `year` (since `5 % 4 != 0`), `year = 9`.
     - Add 5 to `year` (since `9 % 5 != 0`), `year = 14`.
     - Add 9 to `year` (since `14 % 9 != 0`), `year = 23`.
     - Add 18 to `year` (since `23 % 18 != 0`), `year = 41`.
     - Add 18 to `year` (since `41 % 18 != 0`), `year = 59`.
     - Add 18 to `year` (since `59 % 18 != 0`), `year = 77`.
