### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the year when all \(n\) signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
   - Each sign occurs every \(a_i\) years, and the next sign can only occur strictly after the previous one.

2. **Given Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` representing the number of signs and a list of integers `a` representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - It initializes `year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity \(a_i\), it updates `year` by adding \(ai\) if `year % ai` is 0 (meaning the current `year` is a multiple of \(a_i\)), otherwise it adds 0.
   - This logic seems to be trying to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the periodicities but in a simplified manner.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in the loop is flawed because it does not correctly compute the LCM of the periodicities.
   - Instead, it simply adds the periodicity if the current year is a multiple of it, which is not equivalent to finding the LCM.
   - For example, consider the input `5 1 2 3 4 5`. The expected output should be 5, but the given program might produce incorrect results due to its flawed logic.

4. **Example Test Case Analysis:**
   - For the input `6 3 2 4 5 9 18`, the expected output is 36.
   - However, the given program might not correctly handle this case due to its incorrect logic.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**Correctness: False**
