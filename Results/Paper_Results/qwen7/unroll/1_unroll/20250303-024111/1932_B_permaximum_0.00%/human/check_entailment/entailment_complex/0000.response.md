Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the year when all signs of the apocalypse will occur sequentially.
2. The annotated program correctly initializes the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
4. It then initializes `year` to 0 and iterates over the list `a`, updating `year` by adding the minimum of the current `year` and the current element in the list `a`.
5. This approach ensures that `year` is always at least a multiple of each `a_i`, effectively simulating the sequential occurrence of signs.
6. The final `year` value for each test case is printed, which should be the correct year when all signs will occur.

Given the logic and the steps described in the annotated program, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
