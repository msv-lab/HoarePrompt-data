### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step using the annotated code and the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find the year when the \(n\)-th sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
- The \(i\)-th sign occurs every \(a_i\) years.
- The year for the next sign is determined as the smallest multiple of \(a_i\) that is greater than the current year.

#### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        year = 0
        for ai in a:
            year += year % ai or ai
        print(year)
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `t` times, processing each test case.
   
2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - `n` is read from input, representing the number of signs for the current test case.
   - `a` is a list of integers representing the periodicities of the signs.
   - `year` is initialized to 0.
   - A loop runs `n` times, updating `year` for each sign.
     - For each `ai` in `a`, `year` is updated by adding the minimum of `year % ai` or `ai`.
   - The result (`year`) is printed for the current test case.

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Correct Year Calculation:**
   - The expression `year += year % ai or ai` ensures that `year` is incremented to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign.
   - If `year % ai == 0`, `year % ai` is 0, and `year` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, `year % ai` is non-zero, and `year` is incremented by `ai`.

2. **Behavior Verification:**
   - Let's verify this with the example provided:
     - Test Case 1: \( n = 6 \), \( a = [3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18] \)
       - Initial `year = 0`
       - After first sign: `year = 3` (next multiple of 3 after 0)
       - After second sign: `year = 4` (next multiple of 2 after 3)
       - After third sign: `year = 8` (next multiple of 4 after 4)
       - After fourth sign: `year = 10` (next multiple of 5 after 8)
       - After fifth sign: `year = 18` (next multiple of 9 after 10)
       - After sixth sign: `year = 36` (next multiple of 18 after 18)
       - Correct output: 36
     - Test Case 2: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] \)
       - Initial `year = 0`
       - After first sign: `year = 1`
       - After second sign: `year = 2`
       - After third sign: `year = 3`
       - After fourth sign: `year = 4`
       - After fifth sign: `year = 5`
       - Correct output: 5
     - Test Case 3: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1] \)
       - Initial `year = 0`
       - After each sign: `year = 1`
       - Correct output: 5 (after 5 iterations of incrementing by 1)
     - Test Case 4: \( n = 6 \), \( a = [50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006] \)
       - Initial `year = 0`
       - After each sign, `year` is incremented to the next multiple of the respective `ai`.
       - Correct output: 2012

Based on the analysis and verification, the program correctly calculates the year for the \(n\)-th sign to occur.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.
