Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization and Input Reading:**
   - The program initializes `max_val` to 1,000,000 and creates a counter array `cnt_b` of size `max_val + 1`.
   - It reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and the array `b`.

2. **Counting Elements in `b`:**
   - It iterates through `b` and increments the corresponding indices in `cnt_b`.

3. **Finding Initial Matches:**
   - It creates a set `b_values` containing the unique elements of `b`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 0 and `curr` to 0.
   - It iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` and checks if they are in `b_values`.
   - If an element is found in `b_values`, it decrements the corresponding index in `cnt_b` and increments `curr` if the count remains non-negative.

4. **Checking Initial Condition:**
   - If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.

5. **Sliding Window:**
   - It then uses a sliding window approach to check subsequent subsegments of `a` of length `m`.
   - For each new element entering the window (`a[i + m]`), it increments the corresponding index in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` if the count becomes positive.
   - For each element leaving the window (`a[i]`), it decrements the corresponding index in `cnt_b` and updates `curr` if the count becomes non-negative.
   - If `curr` is still greater than or equal to `k` after these updates, it increments `ans`.

6. **Resetting Counters:**
   - After processing each test case, it resets the counters in `cnt_b` for the next test case.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly handles the input reading and initialization.

2. **Counting Matches:**
   - The counting logic for the initial segment and the sliding window is correct. It ensures that only relevant elements are considered and updated.

3. **Sliding Window Logic:**
   - The sliding window approach is implemented correctly. It efficiently updates the counts and checks the condition for each new subsegment.

4. **Resetting Counters:**
   - The counters are reset correctly before processing the next test case, ensuring no carry-over from previous test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
