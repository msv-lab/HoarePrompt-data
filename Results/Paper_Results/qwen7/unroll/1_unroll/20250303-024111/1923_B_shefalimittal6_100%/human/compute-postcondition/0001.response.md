Output State: **`sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`; `n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of n monsters, and `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of the n monsters, and `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets you can fire per second.**

Explanation: The code sorts the indices of the list `x` based on the absolute values of the elements in `x`. The variable `sorted_indices` now contains these sorted indices. The other variables (`n`, `a`, `x`, and `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
