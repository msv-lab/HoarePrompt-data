Output State: **`t` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `idx` is 1**.

Explanation: The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Initially, `idx` is 0, so after executing `idx += 1`, `idx` becomes 1. The values of `t` and `data` remain unchanged.
