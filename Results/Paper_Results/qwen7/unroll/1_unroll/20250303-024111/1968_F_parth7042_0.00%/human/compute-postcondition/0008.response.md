Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer value from `data[idx]`, where `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
- `idx` is greater than the original value, implying that `idx` is an index into the `data` list.
- `results` is a list containing multiple 'YES' and 'NO' strings based on the conditions checked within the loop, and it ends with an empty string.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all the elements in the `results` list with a newline character (`\n`) and then print them.

Given that `results` ends with an empty string, this empty string will be included in the joined output. Therefore, the output will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings followed by an empty line.

Output: **YES\nNO\n...\n** (where the sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings is determined by the conditions checked within the loop, and it ends with an empty line)
