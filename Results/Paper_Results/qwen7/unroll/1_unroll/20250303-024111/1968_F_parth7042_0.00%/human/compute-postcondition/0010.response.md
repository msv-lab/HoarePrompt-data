Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array `a` of integers and a set of queries defined by pairs of indices `l` and `r`. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` is zero or if there exists a subarray within the specified range whose XOR is zero. If either condition is met, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it appends an empty string to the results list. Finally, it prints the results as a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings, separated by newlines.**
