You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each involving an array `a` of integers and a set of queries defined by pairs of indices `l` and `r`. For each query, it checks if the XOR of the subarray from index `l` to `r-1` is zero or if there exists a subarray within the specified range whose XOR is zero. If either condition is met, it appends 'YES' to the results; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it appends an empty string to the results list. Finally, it prints the results as a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' strings, separated by newlines.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the subarray can be divided into more than one segment such that the XOR of each segment is equal.

### Example where the program fails:
Consider the following input:
- `n = 5`, `q = 1`
- `a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0]`
- `l = 1`, `r = 5`

The subarray `[1, 1, 2, 3, 0]` is interesting because it can be split into `[1], [1], [2, 3, 0]` where the XOR of each segment is `1`.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" for this case. Here's why:

1. The program calculates the prefix XOR array `pf`.
2. It then checks if the XOR of the entire subarray (`pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`) is zero. If it is, it immediately concludes the subarray is interesting.
3. Otherwise, it uses binary search to check if there exists a valid split point within the subarray.

In the given example, the XOR of the entire subarray is `1`, which is not zero. The program then tries to find a valid split point using binary search but does not correctly handle the case where the subarray can be split into multiple segments with equal XOR values.

To fix this, the program needs to explicitly check all possible ways to split the subarray into multiple segments and verify if the XOR of each segment is equal. The current implementation does not cover all such cases, leading to incorrect results.
