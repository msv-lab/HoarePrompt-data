Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it is a positive integer between 1 and 2⋅10^4.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state is given as `t` being assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4. This means `t` must be a positive integer within this range.

4. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` will always be a positive integer, but we need to explicitly state that it is greater than 0.

5. **Other Variables**: The variables `n` and `a` are mentioned as remaining unchanged according to the initial state, so no adjustments are needed for these variables.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
