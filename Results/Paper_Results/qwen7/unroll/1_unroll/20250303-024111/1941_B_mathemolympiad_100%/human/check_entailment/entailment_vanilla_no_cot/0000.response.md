Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The solution incorrectly applies the operation in a way that doesn't match the problem statement. Specifically, it subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`. This does not follow the rule where `a_{i-1}` is decreased by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1.

2. **Checking for Negative Values**: The solution checks for negative values in the array but does not correctly handle the operations to ensure all elements can be reduced to zero.

3. **Final Check**: The final check only looks at the last two elements of the array, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the sum of all elements in the array is even. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to make all elements zero because each operation reduces the sum by an even number (specifically, it reduces the sum by 4).

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        total_sum = sum(a)
        if total_sum % 2 != 0:
            print("NO")
        else:
            print("YES")

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
2. Check if the sum is even.
3. Print "YES" if the sum is even, otherwise print "NO".
