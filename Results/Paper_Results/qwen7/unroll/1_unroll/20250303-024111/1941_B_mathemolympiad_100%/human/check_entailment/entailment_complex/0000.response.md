Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and the correctness of the implementation:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numTest`) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).
3. **Operation Execution**: The program iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (inclusive) and applies the specified operation:
   - `a[i] -= opNum`
   - `a[i+1] -= 2 * opNum`
   - `a[i+2] -= opNum`
   where `opNum` is the value of `a[i]`.
4. **Negative Check**: If at any point during the iteration, an element in the array becomes negative, the program immediately prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. There are no logical errors or omissions in the provided code.

Correctness: **True**
