You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \* 10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where each integer a_j satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 \* 10^5.
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        stop = False
        
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        
        if stop == True:
            continue
        
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for all test cases, for each test case, the array `a` will be modified according to the operations defined within the loop. If at any point a negative number is encountered in the array `a`, the program will immediately print 'NO' and stop further processing for that test case. If the loop completes without encountering a negative number and the last two elements of the array `a` are both zero, the program will print 'YES'. Otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The final state of the array `a` will reflect these operations, and the output will consist of either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where `3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5`. Each integer `a_j` in the list satisfies `0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9`. The sum of all integers in the list across all test cases does not exceed `2 * 10^5`. The function returns a value based on the list `a`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
