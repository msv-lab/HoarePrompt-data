Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `minn` is explicitly given as 10001.
   - `mex` is a list of integers. Each element in `mex` is either 10001 or `abs(arr[i] - 10001)` depending on the value of `arr[i]`.
   - `used` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 0 to 10000, and each key is set to `True`.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print()
   ```

Given the initial state, the `print()` function without any arguments will simply print a newline character. 

Output: **\n**
