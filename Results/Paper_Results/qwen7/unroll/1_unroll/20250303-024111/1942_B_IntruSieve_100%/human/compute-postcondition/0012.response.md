Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`. It calculates a modified exclusive maximum (mex) for each element in the list based on whether the element is positive or negative. If the element is positive, it appends the current minimum unused non-negative integer (`minn`). If the element is negative, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum unused non-negative integer. The function then prints these mex values for each element in the list, separated by spaces. After processing, the function sets `minn` to 10001 and ensures that all integers from 0 to `minn-1` are marked as used in a dictionary.**
