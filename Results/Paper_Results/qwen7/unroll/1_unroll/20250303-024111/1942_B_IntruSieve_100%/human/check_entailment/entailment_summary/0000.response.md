Reasoning:

1. The program correctly initializes variables and reads the input as specified.
2. The main logic of the program iterates through the array `arr` and calculates the MEX value for each element based on whether the element is positive or negative.
   - For positive elements, it appends the current minimum unused non-negative integer (`minn`) to the `mex` list and marks it as used.
   - For negative elements, it appends the absolute difference between the element and the current minimum unused non-negative integer.
3. After processing all elements, the program prints the values in the `mex` list.
4. The program ensures that all integers from 0 to `minn-1` are marked as used in a dictionary after processing, which is not strictly necessary but does not affect the correctness of the solution.
5. The program handles multiple test cases as expected.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find a valid permutation `p` based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
