Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is handled correctly by the loop in `func_1()`.

2. **Array Length and Elements**: For each test case, the program reads the length `n` of the permutation `p` and the array `a`. This is done correctly using `int(input())` and `list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The program initializes `minn` to 0 and uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and calculates the MEX for each position `i`:
     - If `arr[i] > 0`, it sets `mex[i]` to `minn` and marks `minn` as used. It then increments `minn` until it finds a number not in `used`.
     - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it sets `mex[i]` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and marks this value as used.
   - This logic is implemented correctly, ensuring that `mex[i]` is the MEX of the subarray `p[0:i+1]` minus `p[i]`.

4. **Permutation Construction**:
   - After calculating `mex`, the program prints the values in `mex` as the permutation `p`. Since `mex[i]` is the MEX of the subarray `p[0:i+1]` minus `p[i]`, the values in `mex` can be directly mapped back to form a valid permutation `p`.

5. **Output Formatting**:
   - The program prints each element of `mex` separated by a space and ends with a newline, which matches the expected output format.

Given that the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the MEX and constructs a valid permutation `p` based on the given constraints, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
