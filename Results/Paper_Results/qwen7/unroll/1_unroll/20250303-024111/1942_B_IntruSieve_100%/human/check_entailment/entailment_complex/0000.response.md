Reasoning:

The annotated program provided does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX for each element in the array `a` but does not correctly implement the logic to ensure that the MEX is derived from the permutation `p` being built. Instead, it tries to find the next smallest unused number, which is not aligned with the problem statement.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Positive and Negative Values**: The program checks if `arr[i]` is positive and sets `mex[i]` to `minn`, but it does not ensure that `minn` is the smallest unused number in the context of the permutation `p`. Similarly, when `arr[i]` is negative, it sets `mex[i]` to `abs(arr[i] - minn)`, which again does not align with the requirement to derive the MEX from the permutation `p`.

3. **Output MEX Values Instead of Permutation**: The program outputs the `mex` values instead of constructing and printing the permutation `p`. The goal is to construct a permutation `p` such that the condition `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i` holds true for all `i`.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
