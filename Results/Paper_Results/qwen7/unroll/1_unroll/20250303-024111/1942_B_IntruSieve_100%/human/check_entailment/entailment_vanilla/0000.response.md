Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It sets `minn` to 0, which is the candidate for MEX.
   - It uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.

3. **Processing Each Element of Array `a`:**
   - For each element `arr[i]` in the array `a`, it checks if `arr[i]` is positive.
     - If `arr[i]` is positive, it means the MEX value should be `minn`. It appends `minn` to the `mex` list and marks `minn` as used.
     - If `minn` is already used, it increments `minn` until it finds a free slot.
   - If `arr[i]` is negative, it calculates the MEX value as `abs(arr[i] - minn)` and appends this value to the `mex` list, marking the calculated MEX value as used.

4. **Constructing the Permutation:**
   - After processing all elements of `a`, the `mex` list contains the MEX values for each position.
   - It prints the `mex` list, which represents the permutation `p`.

### Verification Against Example:

Let's verify the solution with the provided example:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0 1 4 2 3
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 4]) - 4 = -2`
  - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2]) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 4, 2, 3]) - 3 = 2`

The program constructs the permutation `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`, which matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 2:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0 1 2 3 4
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `a_1 = MEX([0]) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_2 = MEX([0, 1]) - 1 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX([0, 1, 2]) - 2 = 1`
  - `a_4 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3]) - 3 = 1`
  - `a_5 = MEX([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) - 4 = 1`

The program constructs the permutation `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which matches the expected output.

#### Test Case 3:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  -2 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2 0 1
  ```

- Explanation:
  - `a_1 = MEX([2]) - 2 = 0`
  - `a_2 = MEX([2, 0]) - 0 = 1`
  - `a_3 = MEX([2, 0, 1]) - 1 = 2`

The program constructs the permutation `[2, 0, 1]`, which matches the expected output.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs the permutation `p` based on the given array `a` and matches the expected outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
