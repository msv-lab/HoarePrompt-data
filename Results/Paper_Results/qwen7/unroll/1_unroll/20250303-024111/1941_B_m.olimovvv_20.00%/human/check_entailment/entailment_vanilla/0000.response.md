Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.

2. **Key Conditions Check:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. `b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2`
     2. `b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`

3. **Conditions Explanation:**
   - The first condition checks if the first element `b[0]` is odd and the second element `b[1]` is not equal to `b[0] + 2`.
   - The second condition checks if the last element `b[-1]` is odd and the second-to-last element `b[-2]` is not equal to `b[-1] + 2`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis:

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `[1, 3, 5, 5, 2]`
- `b[0] = 1` (odd) and `b[1] = 3` (not equal to `1 + 2 = 3`), so the first condition is false.
- `b[-1] = 2` (even) and `b[-2] = 5` (not equal to `2 + 2 = 4`), so the second condition is false.
- Output: 'YES' (Correct)

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`
- `b[0] = 2` (even) and `b[1] = 4` (equal to `2 + 2 = 4`), so the first condition is false.
- `b[-1] = 1` (odd) and `b[-2] = 5` (not equal to `1 + 2 = 3`), so the second condition is true.
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `[0, 1, 3, 3, 1]`
- `b[0] = 0` (even) and `b[1] = 1` (equal to `0 + 1 = 1`), so the first condition is false.
- `b[-1] = 1` (odd) and `b[-2] = 3` (not equal to `1 + 2 = 3`), so the second condition is false.
- Output: 'YES' (Correct)

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`
- `b[0] = 5` (odd) and `b[1] = 6` (not equal to `5 + 2 = 7`), so the first condition is true.
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Test Case 5:
- Input: `[1, 2, 7, 2]`
- `b[0] = 1` (odd) and `b[1] = 2` (not equal to `1 + 2 = 3`), so the first condition is true.
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Test Case 6:
- Input: `[7, 1, 0]`
- `b[0] = 7` (odd) and `b[1] = 1` (not equal to `7 + 2 = 9`), so the first condition is true.
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

#### Test Case 7:
- Input: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`
- `b[0] = 1` (odd) and `b[1] = 1` (not equal to `1 + 2 = 3`), so the first condition is true.
- Output: 'NO' (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operations. The conditions check if the first and last elements violate the necessary constraints for the operations to work, which is a valid approach.

**Correctness: True**
