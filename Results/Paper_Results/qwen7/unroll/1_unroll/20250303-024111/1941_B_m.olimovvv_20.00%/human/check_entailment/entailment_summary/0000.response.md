Reasoning:
The given program checks two specific conditions to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The conditions are:
1. The first element of the array (`a[0]`) should be even or the second element (`a[1]`) should be exactly `a[0] + 2`.
2. The last element of the array (`a[-1]`) should be even or the second last element (`a[-2]`) should be exactly `a[-1] + 2`.

These conditions are derived from the fact that each operation reduces three elements by a total of 4, and thus, the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the array remains unchanged. If the sum of the array is initially odd, it cannot be reduced to zero because each operation reduces the sum by an even number (4).

The program correctly implements these conditions to determine if the transformation is possible. Therefore, the logic in the program aligns with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
