### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation**:
   - The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases `T` and then processing each test case individually.
   - It validates the inputs `n` and `k` to ensure they fall within the specified ranges.

2. **Function `func_4`**:
   - This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a given `n`.
   - If `k` is odd or `k` exceeds the maximum possible Manhattan value for `n`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no valid permutation exists.
   - Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function aims to construct a permutation with the required Manhattan value.
   - It initializes a list `l` with the numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - It iteratively swaps elements in the list to adjust the Manhattan value until it either meets the target value or determines it's impossible.
   - The logic in `func_1` seems to be designed to handle both even and odd `n` by adjusting the Manhattan value step-by-step.

4. **Function `func_2` and `func_3`**:
   - These functions perform specific swaps in the list to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` swaps elements at positions `-c` and `-c - k` in the list.
   - `func_3` swaps elements at positions `c - 1` and `-c` in the list.
   - These functions are called recursively to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_5`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It ensures the permutation is printed in the correct format.

6. **Function `func_6`**:
   - This function orchestrates the main logic by calling `func_4` to validate inputs and then `func_1` to construct the permutation.
   - It prints "NO" if no valid permutation exists and calls `func_5` to print the permutation if one is found.

### Conclusion:

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find a permutation with the specified Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists. The functions are well-defined and handle the constraints appropriately.

### Correctness:

**True**
