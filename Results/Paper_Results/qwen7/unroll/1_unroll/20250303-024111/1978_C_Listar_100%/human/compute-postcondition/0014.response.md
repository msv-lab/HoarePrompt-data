Output State: **The program returns two values, `n` which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` which is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `k` remains as the original value of `k`, but `k` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to its original value.**
