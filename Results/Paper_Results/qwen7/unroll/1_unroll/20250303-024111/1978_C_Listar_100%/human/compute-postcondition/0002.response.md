Based on the initial state provided:

- `n` is explicitly given as 0.
- `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), but its specific value is not provided.
- Both `n` and `k` are the return values from `func_4()`, but since their exact values are not needed to determine the output of the print statement, we can focus on the print statement itself.

The print statement is:
```python
print('NO')
```

This statement will simply print the string 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
