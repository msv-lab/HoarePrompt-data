Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`**.

Explanation: The code defines `l` as the result of calling the function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `k`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, `l` will hold whatever value `func_1(n, k)` returns. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.
