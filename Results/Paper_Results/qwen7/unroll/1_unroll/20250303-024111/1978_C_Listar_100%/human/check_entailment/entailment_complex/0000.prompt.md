Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

for i in range(T):

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, and k is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    c = 0
    for i in range(n, -1, -2):
        c += 1
        
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if k < i - 1:
            return func_2(c, k, l)
        
        k = k - i + 1
        
        l = func_3(c, l)
        
    #State: c is 1, k is 0, l is a list containing integers from 1 to n inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It reduces `k` by half, initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`, and iterates over `l` in reverse order. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`. If `k` is less than the current index minus one, it calls another function `func_2` with parameters `c`, `k`, and `l`. Otherwise, it decrements `k` and calls another function `func_3` with parameters `c` and `l`. Finally, it returns the modified list `l` where `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `l` contains integers from 1 to `n`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a non-negative integer less than the length of list l, k is a non-negative integer, and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_2(c, k, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[-c - k]
    l[-c], l[-c - k] = y, x
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` where the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` have been swapped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `c` (a non-negative integer less than the length of list `l`), `k` (a non-negative integer), and `l` (a list of integers representing a permutation of length `n`). After executing, it returns the list `l` with the elements at indices `-c` and `-c - k` swapped.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a positive integer such that 1 <= c <= len(l)/2, and l is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_3(c, l):
    x, y = l[-c], l[c - 1]
    l[c - 1], l[-c] = x, y
    return l
    #The program returns the list `l` with the elements at indices -c and c-1 swapped.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `c` and a list of integers `l`. It swaps the elements at indices `-c` and `c-1` in the list `l` and returns the modified list.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_4():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros, where both values are 0.
    #State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). `k` is even
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `max_k` is `n`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `k`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values, both of which are 0.
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `max_k` is `n`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `k`, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns two values, `n` which is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and `k` which is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `k` remains as the original value of `k`, but `k` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to its original value.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns either two zeros or two values where `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) and `k` is an integer between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive). If `n` is odd, `k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `k` remains as the original value of `k`, but `k` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to its original value.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers where each integer represents a position in the permutation that satisfies the Manhattan value condition.
def func_5(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: the list of integers from the initial state, printed in the same order with spaces in between.
    print()
    #This is printed: None
    return
    #The program returns an empty list since there are no values being returned or calculated in the provided code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_5` accepts a list of integers `l`. It prints "YES" followed by each integer in the list separated by spaces. After printing, it returns an empty list.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12.
def func_6():
    n, k = func_4()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns 0 for `n` and a non-negative integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, both of which are the return values from `func_4()`
    #State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_5(l)
    return
    #The program returns a value that is the result of calling func_5 with the argument l, where l itself is the result of calling func_1 with arguments n and k.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters directly but relies on the outputs of `func_4()` and `func_1()`. It first checks if `n` (obtained from `func_4()`) is zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` with `n` and `k` (also obtained from `func_4()`), then calls `func_5()` with the result of `func_1()`, and finally returns the result of `func_5()`.
