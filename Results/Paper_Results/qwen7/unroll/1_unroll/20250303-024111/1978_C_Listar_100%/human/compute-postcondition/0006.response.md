Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`; `l` is passed to `func_5(l)`**

Explanation: The code `func_5(l)` calls the function `func_5` with the argument `l`, which is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state, and `l` is updated to be the result of `func_1(n, k)`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` and `func_5` is not specified, the only change in the state is the passing of `l` to `func_5`.
