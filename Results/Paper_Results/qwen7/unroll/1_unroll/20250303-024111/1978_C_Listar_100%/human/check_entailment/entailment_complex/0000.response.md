Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function ensures that `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a given `n`. If `k` exceeds `max_k`, it returns `(0, 0)`, indicating no solution exists. Otherwise, it returns `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function constructs a permutation with a specific Manhattan value. It starts by reducing `k` by half and initializing a list `l` with integers from 1 to `n`. It then iteratively modifies `l` by swapping elements to adjust the Manhattan value. The function returns a valid permutation if possible, otherwise, it returns a list that indicates no solution.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function swaps elements in the list `l` at positions `-c` and `-c - k` to adjust the Manhattan value.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps elements in the list `l` at positions `-c` and `c - 1` to adjust the Manhattan value.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints "YES" followed by the permutation and returns an empty list.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and `k`, then `func_1` to generate a permutation, and finally `func_5` to print the result. If `n` is zero, it prints "NO".

Given the problem statement and the provided functions, the program correctly handles the constraints and requirements. It first checks if a solution is possible using `func_4`, then constructs the permutation using `func_1`, and finally prints the result using `func_5`.

The logic in each function is sound, and the overall flow ensures that the program meets the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
