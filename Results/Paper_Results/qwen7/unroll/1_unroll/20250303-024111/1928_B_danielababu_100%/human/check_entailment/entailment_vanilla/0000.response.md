### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array `a` after adding a permutation `p` to the array `a`.
   - The permutation `p` is a rearrangement of the indices of the array `a`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the number of elements that are the same, we should try to make as many elements as possible equal to the most frequent number in the array `a`.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input data. They do not directly contribute to solving the problem.
   - The main logic for solving the problem is missing in the provided code. There are no functions that process the input array `a` and determine the maximum frequency of any number after adding a permutation.

4. **Expected Solution:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to:
     1. Read the input array `a`.
     2. Count the frequency of each number in the array.
     3. Determine the maximum frequency of any number in the array.
     4. Check if it is possible to make more than that frequency by using a permutation.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not contain any function that processes the input array to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the given program is incomplete and incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described.
