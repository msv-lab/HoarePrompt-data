Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the given problem. The functions defined in the program do not relate to the task of finding the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array after adding a permutation. Instead, they seem to be utility functions for various operations such as reading input, sorting, and calculating prefix and suffix products.

To solve the problem, we need to find a permutation \( p \) such that the transformed array \( a' = a + p \) maximizes the frequency of the most common element. However, the given functions do not provide any mechanism to achieve this.

For instance, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
2
1 2
4
7 1 4 1
```

Expected Output:
```
2
2
```

The provided program will not produce the correct output because it does not contain any logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
