### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array `a` after adding a permutation `p` to the array `a`.
   - The permutation `p` is a rearrangement of the indices of the array `a`.

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the number of elements that are the same, we should try to make as many elements as possible equal to the most frequent number in the array `a`.

3. **Analysis of Provided Functions:**
   - The provided functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, etc.) are utility functions for reading input data. They do not directly contribute to solving the problem.
   - The main logic for solving the problem is implemented in the annotated code.

4. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code correctly reads the number of test cases and the length of the array for each test case.
   - It then sorts the unique elements of the array and finds the maximum element in the sorted array.
   - It iterates through the sorted array and uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to determine how many elements can be made equal to the current element after adding a permutation.
   - The maximum count of elements that can be made equal is stored and printed.

5. **Detailed Step-by-Step Evaluation:**
   - **Step 1:** Read the number of test cases `t` using `func_1()`.
   - **Step 2:** For each test case, read the length of the array `n` and the array `a` using `func_3()`.
   - **Step 3:** Convert the array `a` to a set and sort it to get unique elements.
   - **Step 4:** Iterate through the sorted unique elements and use binary search to determine the number of elements that can be made equal to the current element.
   - **Step 5:** Keep track of the maximum count of elements that can be made equal and print the result.

6. **Correctness of the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the input and processes it to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal.
   - The use of binary search (`bisect_left`) is appropriate for determining the number of elements that can be made equal to a specific value after adding a permutation.
   - The overall logic is sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. It reads the input, processes the array to find the maximum number of elements that can be made equal, and prints the result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
