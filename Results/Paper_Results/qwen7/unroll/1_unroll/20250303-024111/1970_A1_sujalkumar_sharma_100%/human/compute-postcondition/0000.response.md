Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the length of the string `s`, which consists only of the characters "(" and ")", and assigns this length to the variable `n`. The initial state of `s` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is now the length of `s`.
