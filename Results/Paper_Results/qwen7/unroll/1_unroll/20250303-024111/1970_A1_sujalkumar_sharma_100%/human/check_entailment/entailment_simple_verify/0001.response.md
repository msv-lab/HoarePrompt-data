### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the input string `s` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
   - This part is handled correctly and does not need further validation.

2. **Prefix Balance Calculation**:
   - A list `prefix_balance` is initialized to store tuples of the form `(balance, position, character)`.
   - As the program iterates through the string, it calculates the balance at each position and appends the corresponding tuple to `prefix_balance`.
   - If the character is '(', the balance is incremented; if it's ')', the balance is decremented.
   - This part is also handled correctly and matches the problem description.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted using a key that sorts primarily by balance in ascending order and secondarily by position in descending order.
   - This sorting step ensures that the sequence is processed according to the specified rules, which is correct.

4. **Result Construction**:
   - After sorting, the program constructs the result string by extracting the characters from the sorted tuples.
   - The characters are joined together to form the final result string.
   - This step is also correct and aligns with the problem description.

5. **Output**:
   - The result string is printed as required.
   - This part is handled correctly.

Given the detailed analysis of the annotated code and the original assessment, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment accurately describes the program's behavior and reasoning.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
