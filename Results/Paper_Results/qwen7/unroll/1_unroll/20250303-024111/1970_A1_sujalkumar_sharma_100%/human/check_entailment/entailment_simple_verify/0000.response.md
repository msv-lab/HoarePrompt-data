### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   ```python
   s = input().strip()
   print(func_1(s))
   ```
   - `s` is read from input and stripped of leading/trailing whitespace. This is correct and ensures `s` is a valid balanced parentheses sequence.

2. **Computing Prefix Balance:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       prefix_balance = []
       balance = 0
       for i in range(n):
           prefix_balance.append((balance, i, s[i]))
           if s[i] == '(':
               balance += 1
           else:
               balance -= 1
   ```
   - The function `func_1` initializes the necessary variables.
   - A list `prefix_balance` is created to store tuples containing the balance, index, and character of each position in the string.
   - The balance is updated for each character: +1 for '(', -1 for ')'.
   - This part is correct and accurately computes the prefix balance for each character.

3. **Sorting Based on Prefix Balance and Position:**
   ```python
       prefix_balance.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
   ```
   - The `prefix_balance` list is sorted based on the prefix balance (ascending) and then by the negative of the index (descending). This ensures that characters with lower prefix balance come first, and among those with the same prefix balance, characters with higher indices come first.
   - This sorting logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Constructing the Result String:**
   ```python
       result = ''.join([x[2] for x in prefix_balance])
       return result
   ```
   - The result string is constructed by joining the characters stored in the third element of each tuple in `prefix_balance`.
   - This step is correct and ensures the resulting string is formed according to the sorted order.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
