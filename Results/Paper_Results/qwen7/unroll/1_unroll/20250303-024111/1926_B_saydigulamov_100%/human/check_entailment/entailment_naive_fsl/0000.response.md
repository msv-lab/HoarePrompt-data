Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and then reads each row, counting the number of '1's in each row.
3. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. If they are, it prints "SQUARE"; otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

This logic is flawed because:
- A triangle can have different counts of '1's in its rows. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows with 5, 3, and 1 '1's respectively.
- Similarly, a square can have different counts of '1's in its rows. For example, a square with `k=3` would have 3 '1's in each row.

Here is an example where the program fails:
Consider the following grid:
```
5
00000
00000
01110
11111
00000
```
This grid contains a triangle with `k=5`. However, the program will incorrectly identify this as a square because the counts of '1's in the first two rows (both having 0 '1's) are equal.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to check the structure of the grid to see if it matches the pattern of a triangle or a square. This involves checking the positions of '1's in each row and column to ensure they match the required patterns for a triangle or a square.
