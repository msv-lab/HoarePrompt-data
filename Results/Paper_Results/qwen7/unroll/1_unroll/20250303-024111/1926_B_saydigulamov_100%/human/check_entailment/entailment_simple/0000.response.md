Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether a given grid of `1`s forms a square or a triangle.
2. **Given Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, representing the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters ('0' or '1').
   - It stores the count of '1's in each row in the list `k`.
   - The function checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise 'TRIANGLE'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Square Detection**: A square would have the same number of '1's in each row. Therefore, checking if the count of '1's in the first two rows is equal is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid forms a square. This check only ensures that the first two rows have the same number of '1's, but does not confirm the entire grid is a square.
   - **Triangle Detection**: A triangle would have the counts of '1's increasing by 2 for each subsequent row until reaching the middle row, and then decreasing by 2 for the following rows. The given function does not account for this pattern.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a square or a triangle based on the given problem description. It only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is insufficient for both square and triangle detection.

Correctness: **False**
