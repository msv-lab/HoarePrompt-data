Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes t test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer n followed by n lines of n characters ('0' or '1'). It then determines whether the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's, with the size of the triangle or square being greater than 1. The function returns a result indicating the presence and type of the shape (triangle or square) found in each test case.**
