Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 3 (since `range(3, n + 1)` means `i` starts from 3).
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to 3 and that the condition `i <= n` holds true.

Now, let's look at the other variables and their states:
- `t`: This variable is not involved in the loop head and its state does not affect the loop execution.
- `n`: This variable is used in the loop condition but its value is already given.
- `k`: This variable is not involved in the loop head and its state does not affect the loop execution.
- `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`: These are initialized values and do not affect the loop head.
- `r_i` and `c_i`: These are not involved in the loop head and their states do not affect the loop execution.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
