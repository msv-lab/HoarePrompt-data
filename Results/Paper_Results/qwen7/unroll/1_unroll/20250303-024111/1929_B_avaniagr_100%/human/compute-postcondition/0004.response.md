Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific integer value based on the relationship between \( k \) and \( 4n - 2 \). If \( k \leq 4n - 4 \), it prints \( \lceil k / 2 \rceil \). If \( k = 4n - 3 \), it prints \( 2n - 1 \). If \( k = 4n - 2 \), it prints \( 2n \). The function reads these values from standard input and outputs the results to standard output, with one line per test case.**
