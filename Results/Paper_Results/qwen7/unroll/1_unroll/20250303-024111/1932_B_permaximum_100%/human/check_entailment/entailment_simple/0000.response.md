Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and stores it in a structured format (`test_cases`).
2. The function `func_1` iterates over each test case and calculates the year when the nth sign will occur.
3. For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0 and then iterates through each periodicity `ai` in the list `a`.
4. It calculates the next year when the sign will occur by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the current year and the periodicity `ai`. This ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
5. The logic used in the function correctly computes the LCM and updates `current_year` accordingly.
6. After processing all periodicities for a test case, the final value of `current_year` is appended to the results list.
7. The function returns the list of results, which is then printed in the main program.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the year when the nth sign will occur for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
