#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 1 <= n <= 100, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        n, a = test
        
        current_year = 0
        
        for ai in a:
            if current_year % ai == 0:
                next_year = current_year + ai
            else:
                next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        
        results.append(current_year)
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing integers. For each test case, the corresponding integer in `results` is the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for the given list of integers `a`, starting from `current_year = 0`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after executing the inner loop for the given list of integers `a`, starting from `current_year = 0` for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each between 1 and 10^6). For each test case, it initializes `current_year` to 0 and updates it by finding the least common multiple (LCM) of `current_year` and each integer `a_i` in the list `a`. After processing all integers in each test case, it appends the final value of `current_year` to a results list. Finally, it returns a list of integers where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after processing each test case.
