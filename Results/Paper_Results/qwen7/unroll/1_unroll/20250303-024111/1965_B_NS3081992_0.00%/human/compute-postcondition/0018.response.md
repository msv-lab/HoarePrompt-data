Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `lk - 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the variables in the loop head**:
   - `i`: This variable is initialized to 0 before the loop starts.
   - `lk - 1`: This expression determines the upper limit of the loop. For the loop to execute, `lk - 1` must be a non-negative integer.

3. **Analyze the given state**:
   - `lk` is the length of `bk`.
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is the second return value of `func_7`.
   - `l` is the length of `bk`.
   - `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `ans` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `lk - 1` must be a non-negative integer. Therefore, `lk` must be at least 1.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are `lk` and the loop invariant `i` (which is already set to 0).

**Final State**:
State: **`lk` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
