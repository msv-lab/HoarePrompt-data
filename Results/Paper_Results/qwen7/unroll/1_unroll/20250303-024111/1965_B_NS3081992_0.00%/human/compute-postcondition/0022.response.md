Output State: **`lk` is the length of `bk`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2)], and `ans` now includes `2 * k + 1`.**

Explanation: The code appends the value `2 * k + 1` to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the length of `bk` (`l`), the binary representation of `n` (`b`), the second return value of `func_7` (`k`), and the binary representation of `k` (`bk`) all remain the same. The list `ans` now contains all its previous elements plus the new element `2 * k + 1`.
