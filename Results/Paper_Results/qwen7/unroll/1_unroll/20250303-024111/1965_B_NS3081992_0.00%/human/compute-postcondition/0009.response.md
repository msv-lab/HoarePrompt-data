Output State: **`ans` is [2, 3], `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

Explanation: The code `ans = [2, 3]` assigns the list `[2, 3]` to the variable `ans`. The values of `b`, `k`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.
