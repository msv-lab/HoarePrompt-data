State: **`func_10` must return a value greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop `for _ in range(func_10()):` will execute as long as `func_10()` returns a positive integer (greater than 0).
- Since there are no variables defined within the provided function that correspond to the problem description, we focus on the return value of `func_10()`.
- For the loop to execute, `func_10()` must return a value that is greater than 0. If `func_10()` returns 0 or a negative number, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `func_10` must return a value greater than 0.
