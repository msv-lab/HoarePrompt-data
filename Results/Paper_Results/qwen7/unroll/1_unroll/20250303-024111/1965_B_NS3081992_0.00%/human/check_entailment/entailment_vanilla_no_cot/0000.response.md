Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence `a` that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Function Definitions**: The functions defined are not directly used in the main logic, but they are part of the provided code snippet. They handle different I/O operations and some utility functions, which are not relevant to solving the problem.

2. **Main Logic (`func_14`)**:
   - It reads the input values `n` and `k`.
   - It converts `n` to its binary representation to understand the structure of the sequence.
   - If `k` is 1, it handles a special case where the sequence is `[2, 3, 2^i for i in range(2, l)]`.
   - Otherwise, it constructs the sequence `ans` by including powers of 2 up to the length of the binary representation of `n`, ensuring that all sums from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed using subsequences.
   - It ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` by carefully constructing the sequence.

3. **Output**: The sequence is printed in the required format, with the size of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function `func_14` correctly generates a sequence that meets the requirements for each test case. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
