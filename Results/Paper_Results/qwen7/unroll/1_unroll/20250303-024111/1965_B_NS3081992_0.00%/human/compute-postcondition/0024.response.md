Output State: **`ans` is a list containing [1, 2, 4, ..., 2^(lk-2), 2^(lk), 2^(lk+1), ..., 2^l] and `lk` is the length of `bk`, `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7`, `l` is the length of `bk`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, and `ans` now includes `2 * k + 1`.**

This means that after the loop executes, the list `ans` will contain all powers of 2 from \(2^{lk-2}\) up to \(2^l\), including the initial values `[1, 2, 4, ..., 2^{lk-2}]` and the additional values added within the loop, plus the value `2 * k + 1`. The other variables (`b`, `k`, `l`, and `bk`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
