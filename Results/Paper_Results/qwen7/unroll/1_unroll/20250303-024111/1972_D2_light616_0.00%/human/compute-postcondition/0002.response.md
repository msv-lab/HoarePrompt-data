Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `cnt` is 0**

Explanation: The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. The values of `x` and `cnt` remain unchanged from their initial states.
