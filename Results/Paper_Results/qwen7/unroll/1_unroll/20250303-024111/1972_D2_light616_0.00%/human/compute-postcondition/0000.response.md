Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, and `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**

The code initializes `x` to 1, which is a specific value. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they were in the initial state, meaning they are still positive integers within the specified range.
