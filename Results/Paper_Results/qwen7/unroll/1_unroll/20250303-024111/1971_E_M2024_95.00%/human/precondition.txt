t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, k, and q are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ k, q ≤ 10^5, and the sum of k over all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. a is a strictly increasing list of k integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive, and a[k] = n. b is a strictly increasing list of k integers where each element is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. d is a list of q integers where each element is between 0 and n inclusive.
