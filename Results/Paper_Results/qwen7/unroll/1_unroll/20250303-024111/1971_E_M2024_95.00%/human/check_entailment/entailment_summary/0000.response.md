Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( q \).
2. It then processes each test case by reading the lists \( a \) and \( b \).
3. The program calculates the speeds between consecutive points in \( a \) and stores them in the list \( v \).
4. For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment of \( a \) where the query point \( ql \) lies.
5. If the query point exactly matches a point in \( a \), it directly outputs the corresponding time from \( b \).
6. Otherwise, it interpolates the time based on the speed calculated for the segment and the difference in positions.

Given the detailed explanation and the steps involved, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program handles the interpolation and binary search appropriately, and the overall structure aligns with the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
