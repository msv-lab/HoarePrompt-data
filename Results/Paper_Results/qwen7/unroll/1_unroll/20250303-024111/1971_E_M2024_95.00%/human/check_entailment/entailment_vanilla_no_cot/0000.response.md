Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Here's a brief explanation of why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`.
   - It then reads the positions `a` and times `b` where the car stops.
   - It calculates the distances between consecutive points (`ad`) and the corresponding time differences (`bd`).
   - It computes the speeds (`v`) between these points.
3. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment in which the queried point `ql` lies.
   - If the queried point exactly matches one of the known points, it directly outputs the corresponding time.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the exact time using the previously computed speeds and distances.
   - The result is printed, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the logic and the implementation details, the program should work correctly for the provided constraints and examples. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **True**.
