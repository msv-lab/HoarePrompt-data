Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for each test case, including \(n\), \(k\), and \(q\), and the lists \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Speed Calculation**: The program calculates the speed segments correctly by computing the differences between consecutive elements in \(a\) and \(b\). This ensures that the speed between any two adjacent points is accurately determined.

3. **Query Handling**: For each query \(d\), the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate segment in \(a\) where \(d\) lies. It then calculates the exact time taken to travel from the start of the segment to \(d\) using linear interpolation.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case where \(d\) exactly matches an element in \(a\) by directly returning the corresponding element in \(b\).

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct results for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer, as required by the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem specification correctly and produces the expected results for the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
