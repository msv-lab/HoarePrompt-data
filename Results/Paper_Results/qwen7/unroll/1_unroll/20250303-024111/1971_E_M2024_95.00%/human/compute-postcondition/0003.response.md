Output State: The output state consists of `t` lines, each containing `q` integers. For each test case, the integers represent the result of the query `m` calculated using the formula `m += b[s - 1] + bd[s] * (ql - a[s - 1]) / ad[s]` where `s` is determined by the position of `ql` in the list `a`. If `ql` is exactly equal to `a[s]`, the output is simply `b[s]`. The calculations are performed for each query `l` from `0` to `q-1` for each test case `t`.
