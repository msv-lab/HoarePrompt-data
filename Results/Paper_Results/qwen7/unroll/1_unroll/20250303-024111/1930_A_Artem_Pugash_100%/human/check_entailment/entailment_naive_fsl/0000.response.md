Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers from the sorted list and adding the smaller one to the score. This ensures that the sum of the minimum values from each pair is maximized, which aligns with the requirement to achieve the maximum final score. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the program handles all potential cases correctly without any edge cases being missed.
