Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the first line.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (the number of pairs of integers).
   - It then reads `2n` integers and stores them in a list `l`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - The list `l` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Scoring Calculation**:
   - The program iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, starting from index 0.
   - For each pair `(l[i], l[i+1])`, it adds the smaller value (`l[i]`) to the score.
   - This is done using the expression `score += l[i]`.

4. **Output**:
   - The final score is printed for each test case.

### Reasoning

To determine if this approach is correct, let's consider the optimal strategy for maximizing the score:

- The goal is to maximize the sum of the minimum values chosen in each move.
- By sorting the list, we ensure that in each pair `(x, y)`, the smaller value is always added to the score.
- This greedy approach ensures that the smallest available values are used first, which maximizes the cumulative score.

Given that the problem guarantees valid inputs (i.e., all integers are positive and within specified bounds), and the algorithm correctly implements the optimal strategy, the program should work as intended.

### Conclusion

The provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score by always choosing the smallest available values in each move.

**Correctness: True**
