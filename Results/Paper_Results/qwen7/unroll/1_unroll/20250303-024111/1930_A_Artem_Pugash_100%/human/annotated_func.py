#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers on the whiteboard are 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the loop, the score is calculated as the sum of the smallest element in each pair of sorted elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n`, and a list of `2n` integers. It then sorts these integers and calculates the score as the sum of the smallest element in each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list. Finally, it prints the score for each test case.
