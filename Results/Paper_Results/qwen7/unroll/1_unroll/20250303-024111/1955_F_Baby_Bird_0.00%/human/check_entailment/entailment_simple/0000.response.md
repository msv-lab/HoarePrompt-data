Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the optimal removal of numbers by Eve.
2. The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - It transforms each count \( p_i \) to its nearest even number using `int(x) - int(x) % 2`. This operation always rounds down to the nearest even number, which is not relevant to the problem.
   - It checks if the first three transformed numbers (1s, 2s, 3s) are all odd and adds 1 to the result if true. This check is incorrect because it does not consider the bitwise XOR condition.
   - It adds half of the sum of all transformed numbers (integer division). This part of the logic is also incorrect and irrelevant to the problem.

Given the problem description, the correct approach should involve calculating the bitwise XOR of all numbers and ensuring that after each removal, the XOR remains non-zero for as long as possible. The solution provided does not achieve this.

Correctness: **False**
