Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `tc > 0`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `tc` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq tc \leq 10^4\).
3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**: For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `tc > 0` must be true.

Given that `tc` is already a positive integer (as per the provided information), the condition `tc > 0` is already satisfied. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to make the loop execute the first time.

**Conclusion**: Since the condition `tc > 0` is already met with the given state, no changes are needed.

**Answer**:
State: **`tc` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `tc` ≤ 10^4**
