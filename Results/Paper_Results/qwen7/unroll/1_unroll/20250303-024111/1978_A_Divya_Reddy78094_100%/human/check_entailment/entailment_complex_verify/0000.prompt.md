You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 represents the number of pages in each book.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and for each iteration of the loop, `n` is an integer read from input, `nums` is a list of integers read from input and split, and the output is the result of `max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1]`. After all iterations, the value of `t` remains the same, but the values of `n` and `nums` change with each iteration based on user input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of books), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of pages in each book. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the maximum page count of the first \( n-1 \) books and the last book. After processing all test cases, it outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always includes the last element in one of the piles and the maximum of the remaining elements in the other pile. This approach does not guarantee the maximum total number of pages read.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
2 3 3 1
```
The expected output should be 5 (by putting books 2 and 3 in one pile and books 1 and 4 in the other pile), but the program outputs 4 (by putting book 4 in one pile and the rest in the other).

The correct approach would involve finding the maximum and second maximum values in the list and ensuring they are placed in different piles to maximize the sum.
