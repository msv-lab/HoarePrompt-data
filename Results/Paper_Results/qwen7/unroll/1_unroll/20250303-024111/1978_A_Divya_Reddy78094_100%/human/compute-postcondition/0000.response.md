Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and now `t` is the integer input by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), and the code does not modify the range of possible values for `t`, the updated state of `t` remains within the same range. The other variables (`n` and the list of integers representing the number of pages in each book) are not affected by this code, so they retain their initial state.
