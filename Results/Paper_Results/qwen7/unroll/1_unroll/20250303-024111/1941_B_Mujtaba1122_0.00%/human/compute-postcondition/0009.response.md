Functionality: **The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer n. It transforms the list such that for each element at index i (where 1 < i < n-1), if the element is greater than 1 and both its adjacent elements are greater than 0, it reduces the element by twice the value of the left adjacent element, the left adjacent element by itself, and the right adjacent element by the value of the left adjacent element. After all possible reductions, the function calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list reflects these transformations, and the function returns based on the outcome of `func_1`.**
