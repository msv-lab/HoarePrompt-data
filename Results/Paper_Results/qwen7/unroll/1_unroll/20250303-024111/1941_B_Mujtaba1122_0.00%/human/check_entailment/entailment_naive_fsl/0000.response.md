Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the case where the array elements are not all reduced to zero through the specified operations. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input array `[1, 2, 3]`. According to the problem description, we can apply the operation to reduce the middle element by 2 and the adjacent elements by 1. However, the current implementation does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero.

Let's walk through the steps:

1. Start with the array `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i = 2`: 
   - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 1`
   - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 1`
   - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 2`
   - Resulting array: `[1, 1, 2]`.

From here, no further operations can reduce all elements to zero because the middle element (1) cannot be reduced further without violating the constraints of the operation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero for certain inputs, making the correctness `False`.
