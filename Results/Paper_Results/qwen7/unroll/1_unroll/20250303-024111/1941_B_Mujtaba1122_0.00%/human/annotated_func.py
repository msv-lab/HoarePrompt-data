#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The list contains no zero elements.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks each element in the list. If it finds any element that is not zero, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements (which is not possible given the conditions), it would implicitly return `True`, but since the question does not specify what happens when the loop completes normally, we interpret it as the list containing at least one zero, leading to the output state where the list contains no zero elements being the most accurate based on the provided logic.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list contains no zero elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and its length n, and returns True if the list contains no zero elements. If it finds any zero element during iteration, it immediately returns False. After completing the iteration without finding any zeros, it returns True, indicating that the list contains no zero elements.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: The list will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: For every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` is reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` is reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` if the above transformations were applied successfully. If the transformations were not applied (i.e., `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`), the list remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer n. It transforms the list such that for each element at index i (where 1 < i < n-1), if the element is greater than 1 and both its adjacent elements are greater than 0, it reduces the element by twice the value of the left adjacent element, the left adjacent element by itself, and the right adjacent element by the value of the left adjacent element. After all possible reductions, the function calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list reflects these transformations, and the function returns based on the outcome of `func_1`.
