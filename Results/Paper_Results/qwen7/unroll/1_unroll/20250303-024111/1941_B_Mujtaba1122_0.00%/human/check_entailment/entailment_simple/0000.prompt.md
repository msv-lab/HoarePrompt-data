Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Annotated Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The list contains no zero elements.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks each element in the list. If it finds any element that is not zero, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements (which is not possible given the conditions), it would implicitly return `True`, but since the question does not specify what happens when the loop completes normally, we interpret it as the list containing at least one zero, leading to the output state where the list contains no zero elements being the most accurate based on the provided logic.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list contains no zero elements.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: The list will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: For every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` is reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` is reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` if the above transformations were applied successfully. If the transformations were not applied (i.e., `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`), the list remains unchanged.
