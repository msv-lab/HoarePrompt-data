You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list is a list of integers representing the array a, and n is the length of the array such that 3 <= n <= 2 \* 10^5.
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: Output State: The list contains no zero elements.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop checks each element in the list. If it finds any element that is not zero, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any non-zero elements (which is not possible given the conditions), it would implicitly return `True`, but since the question does not specify what happens when the loop completes normally, we interpret it as the list containing at least one zero, leading to the output state where the list contains no zero elements being the most accurate based on the provided logic.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list contains no zero elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and its length n, and returns True if the list contains no zero elements. If it finds any zero element during iteration, it immediately returns False. After completing the iteration without finding any zeros, it returns True, indicating that the list contains no zero elements.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `list` is a list of non-negative integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each element in the list is an integer in the range [0, 10^9].
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0:
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        
    #State: Output State: The list will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop.
    if func_1(list, n) :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: For every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` was initially greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` were greater than 0, then `list[i]` is reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` is reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` is reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. After all possible reductions according to these conditions, the remaining values in the list will reflect these changes. Elements outside the range `[1, n-2]` will remain unchanged unless they are affected by the conditions inside the loop. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True` if the above transformations were applied successfully. If the transformations were not applied (i.e., `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`), the list remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of non-negative integers and an integer n. It transforms the list such that for each element at index i (where 1 < i < n-1), if the element is greater than 1 and both its adjacent elements are greater than 0, it reduces the element by twice the value of the left adjacent element, the left adjacent element by itself, and the right adjacent element by the value of the left adjacent element. After all possible reductions, the function calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final state of the list reflects these transformations, and the function returns based on the outcome of `func_1`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_2` function does not handle the case where the array elements are not all reduced to zero through the specified operations. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the input array `[1, 2, 3]`. According to the problem description, we can apply the operation to reduce the middle element by 2 and the adjacent elements by 1. However, the current implementation does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero.

Let's walk through the steps:

1. Start with the array `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. Apply the operation at `i = 2`: 
   - `a[1] = a[1] - 1 = 1`
   - `a[2] = a[2] - 2 = 1`
   - `a[3] = a[3] - 1 = 2`
   - Resulting array: `[1, 1, 2]`.

From here, no further operations can reduce all elements to zero because the middle element (1) cannot be reduced further without violating the constraints of the operation.

Therefore, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero for certain inputs, making the correctness `False`.
