Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It also correctly reads the grid itself, storing it in a list of strings `gr`.

2. **Initial Assumption:**
   - The program assumes that if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have different colors, it is impossible to make all squares the same color.
   - This assumption is correct because if the corners have different colors, no operation can make them the same without affecting other parts of the grid.

3. **Checking Horizontal Consistency:**
   - The program checks if all elements in the first row are the same.
   - If they are not, it further checks if all elements in the last column are the same.
   - If both checks fail (i.e., the first row and last column are inconsistent), it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - These checks are necessary but not sufficient. They only cover specific patterns and do not account for more complex configurations.

4. **Checking Vertical Consistency:**
   - Similar to the horizontal check, the program checks if all elements in the first column are the same.
   - If they are not, it further checks if all elements in the last row are the same.
   - Again, if both checks fail, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
   - These checks are also necessary but not sufficient.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The program prints the result for each test case based on the value of `ans`.

### Detailed Explanation of Correctness

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks specific patterns and does not account for all possible configurations of the grid. Here are some counterexamples:

- **Counterexample 1:** Consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
  ```
  WW
  BB
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors, so the program would incorrectly return 'NO'.
  - However, by selecting the top-right and bottom-left cells, all cells can be made the same color.

- **Counterexample 2:** Consider a 2x2 grid with the following configuration:
  ```
  WB
  BW
  ```
  - The top-left and bottom-right corners are the same color, so the program would return 'YES'.
  - However, this configuration cannot be made uniform with the given operations.

### Conclusion

The program's logic is too restrictive and does not cover all possible configurations of the grid. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
