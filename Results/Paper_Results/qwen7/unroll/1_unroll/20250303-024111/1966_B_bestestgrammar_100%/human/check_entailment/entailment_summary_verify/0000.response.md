### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's analyze the provided program and the given test case to understand why the original assessment is correct.

#### Program Analysis:
The program checks if the top-left element (`gr[0][0]`) is the same as the bottom-right element (`gr[n-1][m-1]`). If they are not the same, it further checks if the top row and bottom row, as well as the leftmost column and rightmost column, are identical. If any of these conditions hold true, it concludes that it is impossible to make all squares the same color and sets `ans` to 'NO'.

However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for other possible ways to make all squares the same color through the allowed operations. The program only considers edge cases and does not explore all possibilities.

#### Test Case Analysis:
Consider the test case:
```
3 3
BWW
WWB
BWW
```

- The top-left element is 'B'.
- The bottom-right element is 'B'.
- The top row is 'BWW'.
- The bottom row is 'BWW'.
- The leftmost column is 'BWB'.
- The rightmost column is 'WWB'.

The program would check if the top-left and bottom-right elements are the same, which they are. It would then check if the top row and bottom row, as well as the leftmost column and rightmost column, are identical. However, it does not consider the possibility of making all squares the same color through different operations.

To make all squares 'B', we can perform the following operations:
1. Select (1, 1) and (3, 3) to make all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 1) to (3, 3) 'B'.
2. Select (1, 2) and (3, 2) to make all squares in the subrectangle from (1, 2) to (3, 2) 'W', but since all squares are already 'B', no change is needed.

Thus, the program should output 'YES' for this test case, but it incorrectly outputs 'NO'.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to recognize that it is possible to make all squares the same color in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
