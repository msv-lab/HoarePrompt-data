The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid represented by `n` rows and `m` columns containing 'W' (white) and 'B' (black) characters. For each test case, it checks if it's possible to make the top-left element of the grid equal to the bottom-right element by swapping any number of rows or columns. If such swaps can make the elements equal, the function outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function reads the number of test cases `t`, followed by the dimensions `n` and `m` and the grid configuration for each test case, and prints the result for each test case.
