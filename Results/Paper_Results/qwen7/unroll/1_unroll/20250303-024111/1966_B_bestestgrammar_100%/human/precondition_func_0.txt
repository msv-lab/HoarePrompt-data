t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and the grid is represented by n lines, each containing m characters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black), with the guarantee that the total number of characters (n * m) across all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
