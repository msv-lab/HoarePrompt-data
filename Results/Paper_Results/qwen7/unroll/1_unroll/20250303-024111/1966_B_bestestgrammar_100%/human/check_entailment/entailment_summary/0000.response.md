Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color by ensuring that the top-left and bottom-right squares have the same color.
2. The logic in the program checks if the top-left (`gr[0][0]`) and bottom-right (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) squares have the same color. If they do, it proceeds to check if all elements in the first row and column are the same as the top-left square. This is done to ensure that all elements in the grid can potentially be made the same color through the allowed operations.
3. The program correctly identifies that if the top-left and bottom-right squares are different, and no other rows or columns can be made uniform with the top-left square, then it is impossible to make all squares the same color.
4. However, the program's approach is overly simplistic and does not fully account for all possible configurations that could lead to making all squares the same color. Specifically, it only checks the first row and column, which may not cover all scenarios where the grid can be unified into a single color.

Given the problem statement and the need to check if it's possible to make all squares the same color, the current implementation is insufficient because it does not consider all possible configurations of the grid. It only checks a specific condition without validating whether the entire grid can be made uniform through the allowed operations.

Correctness: **False**
