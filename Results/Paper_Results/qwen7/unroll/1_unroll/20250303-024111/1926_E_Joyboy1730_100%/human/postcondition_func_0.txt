The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints one or more integers based on the relationship between \( n \), \( k \), and the intermediate values derived during its computation. Specifically, it constructs a list \( L \) based on \( n \) and then determines and prints the value of \( \text{pow} \times (2 \times (\text{k} - \text{tot}) - 1) \) for the appropriate segment of \( L \) that includes \( k \). The function does not return any value but outputs the calculated integers for each test case.
