Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it correctly initializes variables `n` and `k`.
3. It constructs a list `L` where each element represents the count of numbers that can be formed by multiplying the current power of 2 with an odd number up to `n`.
4. It then iterates over the list `L` to determine the exact position of the `k-th` card based on the cumulative counts and the specific formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)`.
5. The logic to calculate the position of the `k-th` card is sound and matches the problem description.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
