Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each iteration of the outer loop, the program processes the values of `n` and `k` provided by the user input, constructs a list `L` based on the value of `n`, and then calculates and prints an integer based on the value of `k` and the elements in `L`. The printed integers represent the result of the condition `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` for the specific `k` value within the range defined by the accumulated sum `tot` and the elements of `L`.
