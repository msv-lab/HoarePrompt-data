State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 5 ⋅ 10^4, inclusive**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
- The variable `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head that affects whether the loop can execute.
- Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4) for the loop to execute.
