Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node (i.e., leaf nodes), the `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, the `start` variable remains an integer representing the starting node for the round, `dist1` is the distance from the starting node to the first leaf node using BFS.**

Explanation: The code `dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])` performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the `start` node to the first leaf node listed in the `leaves` list. This operation does not change the values of `tree`, `leaves`, `n`, or `start`. Instead, it calculates the shortest path distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` and assigns this distance to the variable `dist1`.
