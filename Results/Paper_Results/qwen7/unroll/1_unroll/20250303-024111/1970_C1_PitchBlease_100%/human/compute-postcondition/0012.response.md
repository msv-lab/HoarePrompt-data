Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree), and `start` (an integer representing the starting node for the round). It constructs a tree representation using the given edges, identifies the two leaves of the tree, calculates the shortest distances from the starting node to each leaf using breadth-first search (BFS), and returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione' based on whether these distances are odd or even. If both distances are odd, it returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.**
