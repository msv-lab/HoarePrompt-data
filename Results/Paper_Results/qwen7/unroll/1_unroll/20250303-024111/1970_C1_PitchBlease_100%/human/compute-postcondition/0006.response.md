Output State: **`tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, `leaves` is a list of nodes that have exactly one adjacent node (i.e., leaf nodes), the `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, the `start` variable remains an integer representing the starting node for the round, `dist1` is the distance from the starting node to the first leaf node using BFS, `dist2` is the distance from the starting node to the second leaf node using BFS.**

Explanation: The code `dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])` calculates the shortest path (distance) from the starting node (`start`) to the second leaf node in the tree using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This new distance is stored in the variable `dist2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
