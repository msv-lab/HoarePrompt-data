Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'yes' and 'no' based on the conditions evaluated for each test case within the loop. For each test case, if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between `a` and `b` equals `-a` or `-b`, it prints 'no'. If the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
