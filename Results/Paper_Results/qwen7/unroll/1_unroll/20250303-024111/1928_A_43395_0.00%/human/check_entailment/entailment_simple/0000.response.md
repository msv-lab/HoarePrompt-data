Reasoning:

1. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The program correctly iterates through each test case using a loop, where `t` is the number of test cases. This part is correct.

2. **Reading Input**: The program reads the dimensions `a` and `b` for each test case correctly. This part is also correct.

3. **Conditions for Printing 'Yes' or 'No'**:
   - **Case 1**: Both `a` and `b` are even. In this case, the program correctly prints 'yes'. This is correct because an even-sized rectangle can always be divided into smaller even-sized rectangles, and those can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
   - **Case 2**: The difference between `a` and `b` equals `-a` or `-b`. This condition is incorrectly implemented. The current implementation checks `(a - b == -a, a)` or `(b - a == -b, b)`, which is not meaningful. Instead, it should check if `a` and `b` are equal, which would imply that no further division is possible without forming identical rectangles.
   - **Case 3**: The difference between `a` and `b` is odd. This condition is incorrectly implemented. The current implementation checks `(a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0`, which is redundant since the modulus operation will always return either 0 or a non-zero value. Instead, it should check if the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is odd, which would imply that one dimension needs to be split into smaller odd-sized pieces, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle.
   - **Default Case**: The default case prints 'no', which is correct for all other scenarios.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic for determining whether a new rectangle can be formed. Specifically, the conditions for printing 'no' are incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
