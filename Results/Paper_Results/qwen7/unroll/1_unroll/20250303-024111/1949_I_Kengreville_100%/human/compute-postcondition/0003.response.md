Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `y` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is None, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None**.

Explanation: The code `r = [None] * n` initializes the list `r` to a list of length `n` where each element is `None`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
