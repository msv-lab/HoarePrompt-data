Output State: `bipartite` is True/False based on the result of all `dfs` calls, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` with some elements possibly set to True, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either 1 or None, `tot` is an integer that could be 0 or non-zero based on the sum of certain elements during the `dfs` calls, `ok` is True if any `dfs` call results in `bipartite` being True and `tot` not being 0, otherwise False.
