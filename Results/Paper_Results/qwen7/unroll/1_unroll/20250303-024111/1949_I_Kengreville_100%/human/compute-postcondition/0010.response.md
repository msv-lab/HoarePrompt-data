Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is None, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `bipartite` is assigned the value `True`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
