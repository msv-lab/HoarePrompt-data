The function processes a game scenario involving a field represented by a 2D grid, players, goals, and scoring. It reads initial setup data from standard input, including grid dimensions, grid content, and game parameters. The function then iterates through a series of game steps, updating player positions, checking for eliminations, goal completions, and golden snitch catches. After processing all steps, it prints the final scores for both teams.
