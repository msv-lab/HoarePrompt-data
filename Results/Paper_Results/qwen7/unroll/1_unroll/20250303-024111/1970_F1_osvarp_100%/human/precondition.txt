N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string containing M characters. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG for a red goal and BG for a blue goal), players (R0-R9 and B0-B9 where the first character is the team and the second is the player number), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is described by a string containing the entity performing the action and the details of the action (U, D, L, R for movement, C for catching, T for throwing).
