Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the scenario where a player scores in their own goal, which results in the opposing team scoring a point. According to the problem description, if a player puts the ball in its own goal, the other team wins the point. However, the provided implementation does not account for this case. Specifically, the `goalIn` function and the logic around scoring do not handle the situation where a player scores in their own goal.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 D
R0 C .Q
R0 R
R0 T
R0 D
B0 R
B0 U
B0 C .Q
B0 L
B0 L
B0 L
B0 T
```

In this case, the red player `R0` scores in the red goal, which should result in the blue team scoring a point. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly and would not print the appropriate message or update the score accordingly.
