Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and m, which are positive integers such that 3 ≤ n, m ≤ 99 and both are odd. It also accepts a 2D list of strings representing the field, a dictionary mapping entities to their coordinates on the grid, a dictionary indicating whether a player is carrying the Quaffle, a list of two lists containing the coordinates of the goals for the respective teams, a list of two integers representing the current scores of the red and blue teams, a dictionary mapping movement commands to their corresponding coordinate changes, and a non-negative integer representing the number of steps in the game. The function does not return anything.**

This means the function processes a game field represented by a 2D grid, involving various entities like players, goals, and the Quaffle, along with their movements and scores, without returning any specific output.
