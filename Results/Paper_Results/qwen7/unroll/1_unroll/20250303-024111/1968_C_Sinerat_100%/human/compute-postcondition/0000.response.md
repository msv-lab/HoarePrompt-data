Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key variable here is the input value that will determine how many times the loop will run.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid. The problem statement mentions that `t` (which is the input value) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means the input value should be within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that the input value is a valid integer within the given constraints.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which should be a valid integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
