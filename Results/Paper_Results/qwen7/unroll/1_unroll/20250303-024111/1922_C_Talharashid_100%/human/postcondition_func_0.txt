The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( n \), a strictly increasing list of \( n \) non-negative integers \( a \), and an integer \( m \). It then computes two dictionaries, \( d1 \) and \( d2 \), based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list \( a \). Finally, for each of the \( m \) queries, it outputs the difference between the values of \( d1 \) or \( d2 \) at specified indices \( x \) and \( y \), depending on which index is larger.
