Functionality: **The function accepts a list of parameters including a positive integer t, where each test case contains an integer n, a strictly increasing list of n non-negative integers a, and another integer m. Additionally, for each of the m queries, it accepts two distinct integers x_i and y_i within the range 1 to n. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func` takes multiple sets of inputs, each set containing a positive integer `t`, an integer `n`, a list of `n` non-negative integers in strictly increasing order, and an integer `m`. It also receives `m` pairs of distinct integers `x_i` and `y_i` for each test case. The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result accordingly.
