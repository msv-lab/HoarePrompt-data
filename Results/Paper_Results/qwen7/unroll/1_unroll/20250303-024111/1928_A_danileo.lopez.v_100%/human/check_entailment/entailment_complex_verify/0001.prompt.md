You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob has a rectangle of size a \times b . He tries to cut this rectangle into
two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides
of the original rectangle. Then Bob tries to form some other rectangle from
the two resulting rectangles, and he can rotate and move these two rectangles
as he wishes.

Note that if two rectangles differ only by a 90^{\circ} rotation, they are
considered the same. For example, the rectangles 6 \times 4 and 4 \times 6 are
considered the same.

Thus, from the 2 \times 6 rectangle, another rectangle can be formed, because
it can be cut into two 2 \times 3 rectangles, and then these two rectangles
can be used to form the 4 \times 3 rectangle, which is different from the 2
\times 6 rectangle.

However, from the 2 \times 1 rectangle, another rectangle cannot be formed,
because it can only be cut into two rectangles of 1 \times 1 , and from these,
only the 1 \times 2 and 2 \times 1 rectangles can be formed, which are
considered the same.

Help Bob determine if he can obtain some other rectangle, or if he is just
wasting his time.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed
by the description of the test cases.

The single line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le a, b
\le 10^9 ) — the size of Bob's rectangle.

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the
a \times b rectangle. Otherwise, output "No".

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive answers.

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 1
    
    2 1
    
    2 6
    
    3 2
    
    2 2
    
    2 4
    
    6 3

Output

    No
    No
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    Yes
    No
    
Note

In the first test case, the 1 \times 1 rectangle cannot be cut into two
rectangles, so another rectangle cannot be obtained from it.

In the fourth test case, the 3 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 3 \times
1 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 6 rectangle can be formed.

In the fifth test case, the 2 \times 2 rectangle can be cut into two 1 \times
2 rectangles, and from these, the 1 \times 4 rectangle can be formed.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (a, b), if either a or b is even, and the conditions specified in the if statements are met, "Yes" will be printed; otherwise, "No" will be printed for that iteration. The final output state is a series of "Yes" or "No" based on the given inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers: `t`, `a`, and `b`. It checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If so, it further checks specific conditions involving division of `a` and `b` by 2. Based on these conditions, it prints 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of 'Yes' or 'No' values corresponding to the given inputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading two integers `a` and `b` representing the dimensions of the rectangle.

2. **Checking for Even Dimensions:**
   - The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even.
     - If `a` is even, it splits `a` into two equal halves (`a1` and `a2`), both being `a // 2`.
     - If `b` is even, it splits `b` into two equal halves (`b1` and `b2`), both being `b // 2`.

3. **Forming New Rectangles:**
   - After splitting, the program checks if the resulting smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
     - If `a1` (or `b1`) is not equal to `b` (or `a`), it prints "Yes" indicating that a new rectangle can be formed.
     - If `a1` (or `b1`) is equal to `b` (or `a`), it prints "No" indicating that no new rectangle can be formed.

4. **Handling Odd Dimensions:**
   - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program directly prints "No" since no even split can produce a different rectangle.

### Correctness Check:

- **Even Dimensions:**
  - If `a` or `b` is even, the program correctly identifies that a new rectangle can be formed by splitting the larger dimension into two equal parts.
  - It then checks if the resulting smaller rectangle can form a new shape that is different from the original. This check is correct.

- **Odd Dimensions:**
  - If both `a` and `b` are odd, the program correctly identifies that no new rectangle can be formed since splitting an odd dimension results in two odd dimensions, which cannot form a different rectangle.

- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program handles edge cases like `1x1` and `2x1` correctly by printing "No" in these scenarios.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
