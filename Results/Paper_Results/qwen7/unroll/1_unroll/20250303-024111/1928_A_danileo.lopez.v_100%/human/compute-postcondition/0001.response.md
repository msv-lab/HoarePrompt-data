Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (a placeholder variable) and the integer `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `_` is just a placeholder and doesn't affect the loop condition, we only need to focus on `t`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

4. **Adjusting the State**: For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0. Given that `t` is already an integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it inherently satisfies this condition.

Therefore, the state does not need to be adjusted further since `t` is already within the valid range that ensures the loop will execute.

**State**: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
