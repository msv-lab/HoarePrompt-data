You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given the time in 24-hour format, output the equivalent time in 12-hour
format.

  * [24-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into 24 hours from 00 to 23 , each of which has 60 minutes from 00 to 59 . 
  * [12-hour format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12-hour_clock#Description) divides the day into two halves: the first half is \mathrm{AM} , and the second half is \mathrm{PM} . In each half, the hours are numbered in the order 12, 01, 02, 03, \dots, 11 . Each hour has 60 minutes numbered from 00 to 59 . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1440 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length 5 with format
hh:mm representing a valid time in the 24-hour format. hh represents the hour
from 00 to 23 , and mm represents the minute from 00 to 59 .

The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

Output

For each test case, output two strings separated by a space ("hh:mm AM" or
"hh:mm PM"), which are the 12-hour equivalent to the time provided in the test
case (without quotes).

You should output the time exactly as indicated; in particular, you should not
remove leading zeroes.

- Annotated Code: 
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 6 (including the AM/PM indicator) representing the formatted time in the 12-hour format based on the original input time in the 24-hour format. The first two characters of s represent the hour in the 12-hour format, followed by ":", then the original minutes from the input time, and finally either "AM" or "PM" depending on whether the original hour was 12 or greater than 12.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the hour is `12`. According to the problem description, `12` in 24-hour format corresponds to `12:00 PM` in 12-hour format. However, the program incorrectly prints `00:00 PM` for `12:00` in 24-hour format. This can be seen in the test case `12:00`, where the output should be `12:00 PM` but the program outputs `00:00 PM`.

To fix this, the condition for checking if the hour is `12` should be adjusted to correctly handle this case. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) == 12:
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

This corrected version ensures that `12:00` is correctly printed as `12:00 PM`.
