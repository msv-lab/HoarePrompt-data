### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems is maximized. The program should find this maximum GCD.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The GCD of the difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
   - We need to check divisors of `x` to find the largest one that can be used to evenly distribute the total difficulty `x` among `n` sub-problems.
   
3. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if splitting `x` into `i` parts of size `x // i` results in a feasible solution where the remaining difficulty can still be split into `n` sub-problems.
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum GCD found.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The logic to update the answer ensures that the maximum GCD is found.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately within the given limits.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `x` is a prime number and cannot be divided into more than 1 sub-problem.
   - It also handles cases where `x` is divisible by `n`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
