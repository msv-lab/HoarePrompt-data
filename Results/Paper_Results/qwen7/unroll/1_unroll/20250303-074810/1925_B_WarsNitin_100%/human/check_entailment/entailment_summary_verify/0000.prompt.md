You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
from math import sqrt

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) where \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum divisor \( i \) of \( x \) that satisfies either of two conditions: \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \), or \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \geq 0 \), \( x // i > 0 \), and \( (x - n \cdot (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0 \). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance of the problemset. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading `x` and `n`.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The program iterates through possible divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`. For each divisor `i`, it checks if breaking the problem into `n` parts with difficulty `i` results in a valid problemset where the sum of difficulties equals `x`. It also checks the complementary part `(x - n * i)` to ensure it forms a valid problemset.
3. **Max Balance Update**: The program keeps track of the maximum balance found during the iteration.

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all potential cases correctly. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or specific input that would cause the program to fail based on the provided logic and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
