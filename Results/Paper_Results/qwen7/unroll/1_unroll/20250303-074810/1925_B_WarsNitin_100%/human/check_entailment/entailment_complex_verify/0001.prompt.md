You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and ((x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0):
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for q in range(int(input())):
        x, n = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x //
                    i) == 0:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. After executing the loop, ans is the maximum value among all possible divisors i of x that satisfy the conditions: x - n * i ≥ 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0, or x - n * (x // i) ≥ 0, x // i > 0, and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by positive integers \( x \) and \( n \) where \( 1 \leq x \leq 10^8 \) and \( 1 \leq n \leq x \). For each test case, it calculates and prints the maximum divisor \( i \) of \( x \) that satisfies either of two conditions: \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and \( (x - n \cdot i) \% i == 0 \), or \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \geq 0 \), \( x // i > 0 \), and \( (x - n \cdot (x // i)) \% (x // i) == 0 \). The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to split a problem of difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems such that the GCD of the difficulties of these sub-problems is maximized. The program should find this maximum GCD.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The GCD of the difficulties must be a divisor of `x`.
   - We need to check divisors of `x` to find the largest one that can be used to evenly distribute the total difficulty `x` among `n` sub-problems.
   
3. **Approach in the Program**:
   - The program iterates through potential divisors of `x` up to the square root of `x`.
   - For each divisor `i`, it checks if splitting `x` into `i` parts of size `x // i` results in a feasible solution where the remaining difficulty can still be split into `n` sub-problems.
   - It updates the answer (`ans`) with the maximum GCD found.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies potential divisors of `x` and checks if they can be used to form `n` sub-problems.
   - The logic to update the answer ensures that the maximum GCD is found.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately within the given limits.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `x` is a prime number and cannot be divided into more than 1 sub-problem.
   - It also handles cases where `x` is divisible by `n`.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum balance.
