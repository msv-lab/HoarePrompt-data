Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x and n are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x. After executing the loop, ans is the maximum value among all possible divisors i of x that satisfy the conditions: x - n * i ≥ 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0, or x - n * (x // i) ≥ 0, x // i > 0, and (x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0.
