Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, there is a logical error in the way the mapping is created and applied. Specifically, the mapping is created such that each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric counterpart, but the implementation does not handle the case where `r` has an odd number of characters correctly.

Consider the test case `b = "tlrhgmaoi"`:

- The string `r` would be `"agilmor"`.
- The mapping would be:
  - `'a' -> 'r'`
  - `'g' -> 'l'`
  - `'i' -> 'm'`
  - `'l' -> 'i'`
  - `'m' -> 'g'`
  - `'o' -> 'a'`
  - `'r' -> 'a'`

When decoding, the character `'a'` in `b` would be mapped to both `'r'` and `'o'`, leading to an incorrect result. The correct mapping should ensure that each character in `r` is uniquely mapped to its symmetric counterpart.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the mapping is correctly set up and applied. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    decoded = []
    for char in encoded:
        decoded.append(mapping[char])
    return ''.join(decoded)
```

This corrected version ensures that each character in `r` is uniquely mapped to its symmetric counterpart, thus correctly decoding the string `b`.
