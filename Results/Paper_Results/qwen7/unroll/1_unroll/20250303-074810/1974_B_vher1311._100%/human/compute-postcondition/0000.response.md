Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `r` is a string containing each unique character from `encoded` in sorted order.**

Explanation: The code `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))` performs the following operations:
1. `set(encoded)` creates a set of unique characters from the string `encoded`.
2. `sorted(set(encoded))` sorts these unique characters in ascending order.
3. `''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))` joins these sorted characters into a single string.

Since the initial state of `encoded` is a string of lowercase Latin letters, the resulting string `r` will contain each unique character from `encoded` in sorted order, and the length constraint on `encoded` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) remains unchanged.
