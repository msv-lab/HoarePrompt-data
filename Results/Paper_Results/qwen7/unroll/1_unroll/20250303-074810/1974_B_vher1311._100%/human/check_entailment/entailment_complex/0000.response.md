Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and processes it test case by test case.
2. The function `func_1` is designed to decode a string that has been encoded according to the specified algorithm.
3. The steps within `func_1` are as follows:
   - `r` is constructed by sorting and removing duplicates from the `encoded` string.
   - A dictionary `mapping` is created where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding mirrored character from the end of `r`.
   - Each character in `encoded` is then replaced by its mirrored counterpart using the `mapping` dictionary.
4. Given the problem description and the steps in the function, the logic appears to be correct and should produce the expected decoded string.

Therefore, the program is designed to correctly decode the encoded strings according to the provided algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
