Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of multiple games between the same pair of players. Let's analyze a case where the program might fail:

Consider the input `(1, 1, 2)`:
- According to the problem description, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` are `0 ≤ p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3 ≤ 30`.
- For the scores `(1, 1, 2)`, the program calculates the total points as `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`, which is even. So, it proceeds to calculate the number of matches.
- The total number of matches is `4 / 2 = 2`.
- The maximum number of matches between the same pair is 2 (since there are only 2 matches in total).
- The program calculates the number of draws using the formula `egalites = total_points - 2 * (p3 - p2) - 2 * (p3 - p1)`, which gives `4 - 2 * (2 - 1) - 2 * (2 - 1) = 0`. Hence, it returns `0` as the number of draws.

However, this calculation does not account for the possibility of having multiple games between the same pair of players. For instance, the scores `(1, 1, 2)` can be achieved with the following scenario:
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1-1)
- Player 1 vs Player 3: Win (2-0)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Win (2-0)

In this scenario, there is 1 draw and 2 wins, which matches the scores `(1, 1, 2)`. The program incorrectly calculates the number of draws as `0` instead of `1`.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
