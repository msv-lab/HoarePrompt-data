Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by iterating over each test case and processing the scores \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\).

2. **Total Points Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total points by summing up \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). This is used to check if the total points are even, which is necessary because each match contributes an even number of points (either 2 for a win/loss or 2 for a draw).

3. **Total Matches Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the total number of matches by dividing the total points by 2. This is used to ensure that the number of matches is feasible.

4. **Feasibility Checks**:
   - The program checks if the total number of matches is greater than 3 or if \(p_3\) exceeds the total number of matches. These checks ensure that the scores are feasible given the constraints of the problem.
   - The program then calculates the number of draws using the formula \( \text{egalites} = \text{total\_points} - 2 \times (p_3 - p_2) - 2 \times (p_3 - p_1) \). This formula accounts for the points contributed by wins and losses and subtracts them from the total points to find the remaining points, which must be due to draws.

5. **Result Calculation**: The program correctly calculates the maximum number of draws by dividing the calculated number of draws by 2 and taking the integer part.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as when the total points are odd (which would result in -1) and when the scores are not feasible (which would also result in -1).

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
