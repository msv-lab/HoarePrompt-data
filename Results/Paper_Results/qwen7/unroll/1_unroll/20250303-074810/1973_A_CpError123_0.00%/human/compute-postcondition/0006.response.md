Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500, and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers \( p_1 \), \( p_2 \), and \( p_3 \) such that \( 0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 \). It processes each inner list in `cas_de_test` to calculate a value `egalites // 2` under certain conditions. If any condition fails, it appends `-1` to the result list. Finally, it returns a list of integers, where each element is either `-1` or the calculated value `egalites // 2`.**
