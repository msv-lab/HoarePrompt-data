Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `u` and `v` are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, `x` is an integer from the input, `y` is an integer from the input, `lst` is a defaultdict where all values are lists.**

Explanation: The code initializes a `defaultdict` named `lst` where all values are lists. This does not affect the values of `n`, `t`, `u`, `v`, `x`, or `y`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
