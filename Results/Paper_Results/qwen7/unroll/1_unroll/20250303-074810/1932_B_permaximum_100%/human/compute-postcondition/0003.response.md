Output State: `results` is a list containing the final year `current_year` for each test case after executing the loop. For each test case `(n, a)`, `current_year` is updated based on the conditions inside the inner loop, starting from `0` and iterating through each `ai` in `a`. The final value of `current_year` for each test case is appended to `results`.
