Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple where the first element is an integer n such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second element is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged from their initial state.
