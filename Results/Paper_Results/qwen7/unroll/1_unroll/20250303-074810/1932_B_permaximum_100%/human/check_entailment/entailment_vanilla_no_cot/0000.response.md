Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is almost correct but has a logical error in the calculation of the `next_year`. Specifically, the logic to find the next occurrence of the sign is flawed. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Next Year**: The current implementation calculates the next year as the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`. This is not always correct because it doesn't account for the sequential nature of the signs.

2. **Sequential Nature Not Properly Handled**: The program should ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The current logic might skip some years if the current year is not a multiple of `ai`.

To fix this, we need to correctly calculate the next occurrence of each sign based on the last sign's occurrence. Here's the corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            # Find the next occurrence of the sign after the current_year
            next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

This corrected function ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one by finding the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than `current_year`. This maintains the sequential nature required by the problem statement.
