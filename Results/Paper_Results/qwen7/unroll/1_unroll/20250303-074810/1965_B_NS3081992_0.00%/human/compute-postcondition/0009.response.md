Output State: b is the binary representation of n without the '0b' prefix, k is 1, l is the length of b, ans is [2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... (up to 2^(l-2))], n is not equal to 2.

In this output state, `ans` is extended to include powers of 2 from 4 up to \(2^{l-2}\), where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from 2 to `l-1`, appending \(2^i\) to `ans` for each iteration.
