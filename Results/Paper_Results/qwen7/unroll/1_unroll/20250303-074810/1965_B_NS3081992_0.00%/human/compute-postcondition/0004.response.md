Functionality: **The function `func_15` outputs a series of integers, each representing the size of a sequence for a specific test case. The number of integers outputted is determined by the return value of `func_10`, which indicates the number of test cases. After executing, the function does not return any value but prints the sequence sizes for all test cases to the standard output.**
