Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads an integer from standard input. This is used to read the number of test cases.
   - `func_2()`: Reads and returns a map of integers from the first line of input. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_3()`: Reads and returns a list of integers from the first line of input. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_4(rows_number)`: Returns a list of lists, each containing integers read from the standard input. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_5()`: Reads a line from standard input and returns it without modification. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_6()`: Reads a line from standard input, strips the newline character, and returns it as a string. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_7()`: Reads a line of space-separated integers from standard input and returns them as a list. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_8(rows)`: Returns a list of lists, each containing integers read from the standard input. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_9()`: Reads user input as a string. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_10()`: Reads an integer from standard input. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_11()`: Reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_12()`: A recursive function that computes something related to graph processing. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_13()`: Implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. This is not used in the provided solution.
   - `func_14()`: Generates a sequence of integers based on the given `n` and `k`. This function is correctly implemented to solve the problem.
   - `func_15()`: Loops through the number of test cases, reads `n` and `k` for each test case, and prints the result of `func_14()` for each test case. This is the main driver function.

2. **Problem Description**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - No subsequence sums to `k`.
     - All integers from 1 to `n` (excluding `k`) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - The function correctly handles the generation of sequences based on the values of `n` and `k`.
   - For `k == 1`, it generates a sequence that avoids `k` and ensures all other integers can be formed.
   - For `k > 1`, it generates a sequence that avoids `k` and ensures all other integers can be formed, while also including `k+1` and `2*k+1` to ensure the required subsequences.

4. **Main Function `func_15()`**:
   - It correctly iterates over the number of test cases and prints the sequence size and the sequence itself using `func_14()`.

Given the analysis, the provided functions collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
