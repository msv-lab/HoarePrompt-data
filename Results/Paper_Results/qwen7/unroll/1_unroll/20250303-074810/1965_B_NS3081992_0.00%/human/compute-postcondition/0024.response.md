Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns either '1\n2' or a space-separated string of numbers starting from 2, 3, followed by powers of 2 from \(2^2\) to \(2^{(length \, of \, b - 2)}\), and ends with \(k + 1\) and \(2 * k + 1\) if \(k\) is 1, otherwise it includes 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, \(k + 1\), \(2 * k + 1\), 2.**
