Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is updated to contain the shortest distances from node 0 to all nodes using BFS, `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path for each node.**

Explanation: The code performs a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from node 0 to find the shortest distances (`d`) from node 0 to all other nodes. It also calculates the `previous` list which keeps track of the previous node in the shortest path to each node. The initial values of `a`, `n`, and `u2vs` remain unchanged.
