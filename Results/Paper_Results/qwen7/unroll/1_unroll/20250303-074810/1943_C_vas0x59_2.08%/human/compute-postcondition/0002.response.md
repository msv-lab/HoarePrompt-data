Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains `_` and `range(n - 1)`. The variable `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable and does not carry any specific value, but it is part of the loop structure. The key variable here is `n - 1`, which determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `n - 1` is a positive integer. Given that `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, it follows that `0 ≤ n - 1 ≤ 1999`. For the loop to execute, `n - 1` must be at least 1 (since the loop runs from `0` to `n-2`).

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: We need to ensure that the condition `n - 1` is satisfied. This means `n` must be at least 2 (because `n - 1` must be at least 1).

Given these points, we can conclude that the state before the loop should be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be at least 2.

**State:**
**`n` must be at least 2**
