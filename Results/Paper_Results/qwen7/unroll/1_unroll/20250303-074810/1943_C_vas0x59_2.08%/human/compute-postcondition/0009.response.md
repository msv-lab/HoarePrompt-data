Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is updated to contain the shortest distances from node 0 to all nodes using BFS, `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path for each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `path_ba` is a list containing the value `b`.**

Explanation: The line `path_ba = [b]` creates a list named `path_ba` and assigns it the value `[b]`. This means `path_ba` now contains the single element `b`. The values of `a`, `d`, `previous`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial states.
