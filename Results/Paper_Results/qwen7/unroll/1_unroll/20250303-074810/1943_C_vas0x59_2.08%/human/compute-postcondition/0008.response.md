Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is updated to contain the shortest distances from node 0 to all nodes using BFS, `previous` is a list containing the previous node in the shortest path for each node, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. The values of `a`, `d`, and `previous` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, `a` is still the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is still updated to contain the shortest distances from node 0 to all nodes using BFS, and `previous` is still a list containing the previous node in the shortest path for each node. The only new information is that `b` now holds the result of `func_1(d)`.
