Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions involving these integers and the sorted list of chosen vertices. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n - 2` for each test case.**
