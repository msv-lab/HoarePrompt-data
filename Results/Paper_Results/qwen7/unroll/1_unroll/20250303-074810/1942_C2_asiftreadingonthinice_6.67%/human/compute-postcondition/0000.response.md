Output State: **`tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. All other variables retain their initial conditions.**

This means that `tt` now holds the number of test cases, and the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` as well as the lists of integers from the subsequent inputs have yet to be read.
