Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `ii` and the variable `tt`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `ii` and `tt`**:
   - `tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `tt` is an integer input from the user.
   - The value of `tt` is between 1 and \(10^4\) inclusive.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for ii in range(tt):` will execute as long as `ii` is less than `tt`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `ii` must be 0 initially, and `tt` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `tt` is the only variable that directly controls the loop's execution, it must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `ii` is initialized to 0 at the start of each iteration of the loop, but we need to ensure that the loop can start with `ii` being 0.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `tt` must be greater than 0.
- `ii` must be 0 (though this is more of a default initialization rather than something that needs to be explicitly set in the state).

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`tt` must be greater than 0**
