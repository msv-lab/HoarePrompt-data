You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the list. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if b[0] % 2 == 1 and b[1] != b[0] + 2 or b[-1] % 2 == 1 and b[-2] != b[-1] + 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the first element of the list `b` is odd and the second element is not equal to the first element plus 2, or if the last element of the list `b` is odd and the second-to-last element is not equal to the last element plus 2, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `a` of integers, where the length of the list `n` satisfies 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 × 10^5, and each element `a_j` in the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. Additionally, there is a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) associated with each test case, though `t` is not directly passed as a parameter to the function. The function returns a value based on the list `a` and the integer `t`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
