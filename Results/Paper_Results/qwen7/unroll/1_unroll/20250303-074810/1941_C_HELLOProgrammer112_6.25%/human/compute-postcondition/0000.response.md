Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.

2. **Determine the state adjustments**: Since `_` is just a placeholder and does not hold any specific value, the only thing that needs to be considered is the input that will determine how many times the loop will run. This is determined by `int(input())`.

3. **Ensure the loop can execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer. Given the constraints, `t` (which is the input) must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input `t` to ensure the loop can execute. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
