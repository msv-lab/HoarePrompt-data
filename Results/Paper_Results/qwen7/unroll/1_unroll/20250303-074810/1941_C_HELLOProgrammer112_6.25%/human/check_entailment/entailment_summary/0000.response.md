Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string `s` and prints their total count. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful, not just count the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'.

For example, consider the input string "mmapnapie". The program would count two occurrences of 'map' and one occurrence of 'pie', resulting in a total count of 3. But the correct solution should only remove the minimum number of characters needed to eliminate both 'map' and 'pie', which in this case is 2 (removing the 4th and 9th characters).

Therefore, the program does not address the actual requirement of minimizing deletions to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **False**
