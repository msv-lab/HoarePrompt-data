The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`. For each test case, it calculates a value `year` based on the elements of the list `a` and prints the result. The calculation involves summing up values derived from each element in the list, specifically `year + (year % ai or ai)` for each element `ai`. This process is repeated for `t` test cases, where `t` is the number of test cases provided.
