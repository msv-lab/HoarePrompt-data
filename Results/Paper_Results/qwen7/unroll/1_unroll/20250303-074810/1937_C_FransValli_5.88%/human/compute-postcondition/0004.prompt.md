You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function interacts with an external entity to perform queries and obtain responses. The input variables are n (an integer representing the size of the permutation), and the permutation itself (though it is not directly passed as an argument to the function).
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        k = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n):
            print('?', 0, k, 0, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                k = i
        
        best = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', k, best, k, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                best = i
        
        print('!', k, best, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of two integers, `k` and `best`, which are determined through a series of comparisons within the loop. Specifically, `k` is set to the first value that is found to be less than a subsequent value during the first inner loop, and `best` is set to the first value that is found to be less than `k` during the second inner loop. The exact values of `k` and `best` depend on the input permutation and the results of the comparison queries made to the external entity.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but interacts with an external entity to perform queries based on the size of a permutation (n) and the permutation itself, which are implied from the context. It returns either a valid response based on the permutation or indicates an error if the permutation is invalid.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
