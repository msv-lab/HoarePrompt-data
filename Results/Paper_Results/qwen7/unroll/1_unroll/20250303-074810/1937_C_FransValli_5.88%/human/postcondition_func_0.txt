The function interacts with an external entity to determine a valid pair of integers \( k \) and \( best \) based on a given permutation. It performs a series of comparison queries to find \( k \) as the first element less than a subsequent element, and then finds \( best \) as the first element less than \( k \). If such elements are found, it outputs \( k \) and \( best \); otherwise, it indicates an error.
