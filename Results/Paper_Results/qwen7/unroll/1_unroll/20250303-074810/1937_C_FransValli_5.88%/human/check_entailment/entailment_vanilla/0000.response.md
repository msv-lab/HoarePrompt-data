### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can query the relative values of \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) to compare them.

2. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The provided solution attempts to find the index `k` where \(p_k\) is likely to be the largest element in the permutation.
     - It iterates through potential candidates for `k` starting from 2 up to `n-1`. For each candidate, it compares \((p_0 \mid p_k)\) with \((p_0 \mid p_i)\) for \(i\) from 2 to `n-1`.
     - If \((p_0 \mid p_k) < (p_0 \mid p_i)\), it updates `k` to `i`.

3. **Finding the Best Index:**
   - After identifying `k`, it then checks against all other indices to find the one that maximizes the bitwise OR with `k`.
     - It compares \((p_k \mid p_best)\) with \((p_k \mid p_i)\) for all \(i\) from 1 to `n-1`.
     - If \((p_k \mid p_best) < (p_k \mid p_i)\), it updates `best` to `i`.

4. **Query Count:**
   - The solution makes at most \(2(n-2) + 1 = 2n - 3\) queries for finding `k` and `best`.
   - This is less than \(3n\) queries, which is within the allowed limit.

5. **Output:**
   - The solution prints the indices `k` and `best` as the answer.

### Evaluation:

- The strategy of finding the index `k` with the highest bitwise OR with `p_0` is sound.
- The subsequent step of finding the index `best` that maximizes the bitwise OR with `k` is also correct.
- The number of queries used is within the allowed limit.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the strategy to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.

**Correctness: **True**
