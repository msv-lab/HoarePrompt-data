To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze each function step by step and verify if they collectively solve the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1(n, k)`
This function aims to construct a permutation with a specific Manhattan value `k`. Here’s what it does:
1. It initializes a list `l` with numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. It iteratively modifies this list to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
3. If `k` becomes zero, it returns the list `l`.
4. Otherwise, it shifts elements to try to reach the required `k`.

However, the logic in `func_1` seems flawed. Specifically, the way it handles the shifting of elements and the decrement of `k` might not always lead to the correct permutation. For instance, it doesn't account for all possible permutations and their corresponding Manhattan values correctly.

#### Function `func_2()`
This function checks if a given `k` can be achieved for a permutation of length `n`. Here’s what it does:
1. It checks if `k` is even because the Manhattan value must be even.
2. It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`.
3. If `max_k` is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)` indicating no solution exists.
4. Otherwise, it returns `(n, k)`.

This function seems to handle the feasibility check correctly but doesn't provide a direct solution for constructing the permutation.

#### Function `func_3(l)`
This function prints the permutation `l` if it is valid. It simply prints 'YES' followed by the permutation elements.

#### Function `func_4()`
This function ties everything together:
1. It calls `func_2()` to check feasibility.
2. If the result indicates no solution (`n == 0`), it prints 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, it calls `func_1()` to generate the permutation and `func_3()` to print it.

### Overall Correctness Check

1. **Feasibility Check**: `func_2()` correctly checks if a permutation with the given `k` can exist.
2. **Permutation Generation**: `func_1()` attempts to generate the permutation but does so in a way that may not always work, especially for larger values of `n` and `k`.
3. **Solution Printing**: `func_3()` and `func_4()` correctly handle the printing of the permutation or the 'NO' message.

Given the issues in `func_1()`, which might not always produce a valid permutation, the overall correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed.

### Conclusion

The program as written is **not** fully correct because `func_1()` may fail to generate a valid permutation in some cases, despite `func_2()` correctly identifying when a solution is impossible.

**Correctness: False**
