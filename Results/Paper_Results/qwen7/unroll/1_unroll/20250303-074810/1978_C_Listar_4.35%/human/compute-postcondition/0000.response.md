Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12; `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`**.

This means that the function `func_2()` has returned two values, which are assigned to `n` and `k` respectively. The constraints on `n` and `k` remain the same as they were before the assignment, but now these variables hold the specific values returned by `func_2()`.
