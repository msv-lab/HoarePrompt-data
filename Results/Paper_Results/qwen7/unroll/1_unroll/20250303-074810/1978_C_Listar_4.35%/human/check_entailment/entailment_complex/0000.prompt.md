Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    8
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    7 0
    
    1 1000000000000
    
    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

Output

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

#Function 1:

def func_1(n, k):
    k = k // 2
    l = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if k == 0:
            return l
        
        if 1 + i > k:

    #State: Output State: `l` is a list where the last element is moved to the front, repeated until `k` becomes zero or less, and the process stops early if the condition `1 + i > k` is met for any iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It manipulates a list `l` containing integers from 1 to `n` by moving the last element to the front repeatedly until `k` becomes zero or less. If the condition `1 + i > k` is met during the iteration, the function stops early. The final state of the list `l` is returned.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5} and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}.
def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())

    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `k` is even. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is (n - 1) / 2. If `n` is even, `max_k` is `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, and `k` is even, and `max_k` is greater than or equal to `k`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and k, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12 and k is even.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input, where \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \) and \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^{12} \). It then checks if \( k \) is even. If \( k \) is odd, it returns two zeros (0, 0). Otherwise, it calculates the maximum possible value of \( k \) based on \( n \), and if \( k \) exceeds this maximum, it also returns two zeros (0, 0). If \( k \) is within the valid range, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a valid permutation of length n such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to k.
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: The elements of the list l printed in the same order they appear in the list, separated by a space.
    print()
    #This is printed: ''
    return
    #The program returns an empty value since there is no value being returned in the given code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `l` representing a valid permutation of length `n` with a Manhattan value equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by each element of the list `l` separated by a space. After printing, the function concludes without returning any value.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12. n is the length of the permutation, and k is the required Manhattan value.
def func_4():
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: 'NO'
        return
        #The program returns 0 for `n` and an integer `k` such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12; `n` and `k` are the return values of `func_2()`. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no direct parameters but uses values `n` and `k` obtained from `func_2()`. If `n` is not zero, it calls `func_1(n, k)` and then `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the result of `func_1(n, k)`. If `n` is zero, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. The function returns 0 under certain conditions or None otherwise.
