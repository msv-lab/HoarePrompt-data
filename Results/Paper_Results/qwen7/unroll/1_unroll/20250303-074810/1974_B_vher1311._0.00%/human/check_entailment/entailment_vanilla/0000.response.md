Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded string.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` of the encoded string `b` and the encoded string itself.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes an encoded string `s` as input.
   - It extracts all unique characters from `s` and sorts them alphabetically to form the string `unique_chars`.
   - It initializes two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse `unique_chars` from both ends.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and replaces it with the corresponding character from `unique_chars` based on the symmetry (i.e., the character at position `j`).
   - If a character in `s` is not found in `unique_chars`, it inserts the character into `unique_chars` at position `i` and increments both `i` and `j`.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to encode a string, not decode it. The logic in `func_1` is incorrect for decoding.
   - Specifically, the function tries to replace characters in `s` with characters from `unique_chars`, but it does not handle the decoding process correctly.
   - The function does not reverse the mapping that was used during encoding. Instead, it attempts to insert new characters into `unique_chars`, which is not the intended behavior for decoding.

### Correct Decoding Logic

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Extract all unique characters from the encoded string and sort them alphabetically.
2. Create a mapping from each character in the encoded string to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters.
3. Use this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = decode_string(b)
        print(decoded_str)

def decode_string(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    mapping = {char: unique_chars[i] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars[::-1])}
    decoded_str = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in s)
    return decoded_str
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Input Reading**: Same as the original program.
2. **Function `decode_string`**:
   - Extracts all unique characters from `s` and sorts them alphabetically.
   - Creates a mapping where each character in the encoded string is mapped to its corresponding character in the sorted unique characters (using the reversed order).
   - Uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

### Conclusion

The provided program is incorrect because the function `func_1` is designed to encode, not decode. The corrected program above should be used instead.

**Correctness: **False**
