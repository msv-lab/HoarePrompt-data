Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9. The function returns a result based on the input for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case without needing any additional parameters passed directly to it.
