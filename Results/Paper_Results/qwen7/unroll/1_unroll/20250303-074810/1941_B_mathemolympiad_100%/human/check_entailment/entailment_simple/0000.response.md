Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`numTest`) and processes each test case individually. It reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).

2. **Operation Logic**: The core of the solution is the nested loop that performs the specified operation. However, there are a few issues with the logic:
   - The operation is applied in a way that reduces elements by multiples of the current element at position `i`. This is incorrect because the operation should only reduce elements by specific amounts as defined in the problem statement.
   - The code incorrectly applies the operation in a way that doesn't follow the problem's rules. Specifically, it subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`, which is not what the problem describes.

3. **Termination Conditions**: The code checks if any element becomes negative during the process and prints 'NO' immediately if so. This part is correct but is applied incorrectly due to the flawed operation logic.

4. **Final Check**: The final check ensures that the last two elements of the array are zero. This is necessary but insufficient since the earlier operation logic is incorrect.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the required operations and thus cannot solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
