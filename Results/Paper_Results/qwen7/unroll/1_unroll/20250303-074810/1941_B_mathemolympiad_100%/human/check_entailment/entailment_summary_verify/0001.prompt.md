You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(0, numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        stop = False
        for i in range(0, n - 2):
            if a[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                stop = True
                break
            opNum = a[i]
            a[i] -= opNum
            a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
            a[i + 2] -= opNum
        if stop == True:
            continue
        if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (size of the array), and an array a of n integers. It then iterates through the array and modifies its elements according to specific rules. If any element becomes negative during the iteration, it prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. If the last two elements of the array are not zero after the iteration, it also prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `numTest`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.

2. **Checking for Negative Values:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index 0 to `n-3` (inclusive).
   - For each element `a[i]`, it checks if `a[i]` is less than 0.
   - If any `a[i]` is negative, it prints 'NO' and sets `stop` to `True`, breaking out of the loop.

3. **Applying Operations:**
   - If no negative values are found, the program applies the operation defined in the problem statement.
   - It calculates the number of operations needed (`opNum`) which is `a[i]`.
   - It then updates the array by subtracting `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2*opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are zero.
   - If either `a[n-1]` or `a[n-2]` is not zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Handling Negative Values:**
   - The program correctly identifies if any value in the array becomes negative during the operations. This is crucial because the operations defined in the problem cannot produce negative values, so if a negative value appears, it means the array cannot be made entirely zero.

2. **Applying Operations:**
   - The operations are applied correctly according to the problem statement. Each operation reduces three consecutive elements by specific amounts.

3. **Final Check:**
   - The final check ensures that after all operations, the last two elements of the array are zero, which is necessary for the array to be completely zeroed out.

### Conclusion

The program logic correctly implements the problem requirements and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
