State: **`numTest` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` and `numTest`.
- The loop will execute if `numTest` is greater than 0.
- The variable `_` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
- Since all other variables are in their initial state, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
