Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The logic for applying the operation is flawed. The current implementation subtracts `opNum` from `a[i]`, `2 * opNum` from `a[i+1]`, and `opNum` from `a[i+2]`. However, the problem specifies that the operation should subtract 1 from `a[i-1]`, 2 from `a[i]`, and 1 from `a[i+1]`. This means the indices in the subtraction should be adjusted accordingly.

2. **Early Termination**: The code checks if any element is negative and prints 'NO' immediately. While this is a valid condition for stopping, it doesn't handle all cases where the array can still be made zero.

3. **Final Check**: The final check only looks at the last two elements (`a[len(a) - 1]` and `a[len(a) - 2]`). It should check all elements to ensure they are zero.

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    numTest = int(input())
    for _ in range(numTest):
        n = int(input())
        a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        # Ensure the operation can be applied to all elements
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if a[i] < a[i - 1] + a[i + 1]:
                print('NO')
                break
        else:
            # If the loop completes without breaking, it means we can potentially make all elements zero
            print('YES')

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the operation can be applied to all elements and checks if the initial conditions allow making all elements zero.
