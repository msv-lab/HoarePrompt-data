Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `a`), the code checks if the number of '1's in the first two strings (`b`) are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The final output state will be a series of lines, each containing either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE', corresponding to the number of iterations of the outer loop.
