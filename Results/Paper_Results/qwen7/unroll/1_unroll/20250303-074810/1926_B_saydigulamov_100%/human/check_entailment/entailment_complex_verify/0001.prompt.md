You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('TRIANGLE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `a`), the code checks if the number of '1's in the first two strings (`b`) are equal. If they are equal, it prints 'SQUARE', otherwise it prints 'TRIANGLE'. The final output state will be a series of lines, each containing either 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE', corresponding to the number of iterations of the outer loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of grids, each containing exactly one triangle or one square formed by '1's. For each grid, it counts the number of '1's in the first two rows and compares these counts. If the counts are equal, it indicates a square; otherwise, it indicates a triangle. The function outputs 'SQUARE' or 'TRIANGLE' for each grid based on this comparison.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes an empty list `k` to store the count of `1`s in each row.
   - It iterates through each row of the grid, counts the number of `1`s in each row, and appends this count to the list `k`.

3. **Determining the Shape:**
   - The program checks if the first two counts in the list `k` are equal (`k[0] == k[1]`).
   - If they are equal, it prints "SQUARE".
   - Otherwise, it prints "TRIANGLE".

### Analysis of the Logic:

- **Triangle Detection:**
  - A triangle or an upside-down triangle will have rows with increasing numbers of `1`s until the middle row, then decreasing numbers of `1`s.
  - For example, for a triangle with `k=4`, the counts of `1`s would be `[1, 3, 5, 3, 1]`.
  - The program only checks the first two counts and does not check the entire sequence, which means it cannot correctly identify a triangle.

- **Square Detection:**
  - A square will have the same number of `1`s in each row.
  - For example, for a square with `k=4`, the counts of `1`s would be `[4, 4, 4, 4]`.
  - The program correctly checks if the first two counts are equal, which is sufficient to determine a square since all counts should be equal.

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly identifies triangles because it only checks the first two counts and does not verify the entire pattern. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
