Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is an input integer, for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.**

The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The other variables and their conditions remain unchanged.
