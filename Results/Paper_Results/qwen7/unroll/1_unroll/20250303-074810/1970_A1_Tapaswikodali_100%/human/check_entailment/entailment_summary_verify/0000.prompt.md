You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if infoA.balance != infoB.balance:
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
    return infoB.position - infoA.position

#Function 2:
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join((info.character for info in balance_info))
    print(result)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses, sorts the characters based on their balance and original position, and prints a new string formed by these characters in the sorted order. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, the final balance `balance`, and a printed string `result` which is a concatenation of characters from `s` sorted by their balance and position.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not used within the program, and the logic for sorting the `balance_info` does not align with the required steps. The program attempts to sort the balance information but does not ensure that the final sequence is a valid balanced shuffle.

To illustrate the issue, consider the input `(()(()))`. According to the problem description, the balanced shuffle should be `()(()())`. However, the current implementation does not produce this output. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the problem:

1. **Compute Prefix Balances**: 
   - For `(()(()))`, the prefix balances are: `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`.
   - Positions: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

2. **Sort by Prefix Balance and Position**:
   - After sorting, the sequence should be: `()(()())`.

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle the sorting and reassembly of the sequence. The provided code sorts the balance information but does not ensure that the resulting sequence is a valid balanced shuffle.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
class BalanceInfo:
    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character

def balanced_shuffle(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
    
    # Sort by prefix balance, breaking ties by position in descending order
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    
    # Reconstruct the balanced shuffle sequence
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)

# Example usage
balanced_shuffle("(()(()))")
```

This corrected version ensures that the sequence is reconstructed correctly according to the specified rules.
