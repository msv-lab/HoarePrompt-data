Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t â€” the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

# Annotated Functions:
class BalanceInfo:

    def __init__(self, balance, position, character):
        self.balance = balance
        self.position = position
        self.character = character
if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input().strip()
    func_2(s)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between the balance of infoA and the balance of infoB
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a parentheses sequence. The balance of `infoA` is equal to the balance of `infoB`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `infoA` and `infoB`, which are objects with attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). Depending on the values of these attributes, the function returns either the difference between the `balance` of `infoA` and `infoB` or the difference between the `position` of `infoB` and `infoA`. Specifically, if the `balance` of `infoA` is not equal to the `balance` of `infoB`, it returns the difference in their balances; otherwise, it returns the difference in their positions.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance` is the final balance calculated after processing all characters in `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects, each containing the balance, index, and character from `s` at that index.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string consisting of characters from s ordered by their balance and position
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses, sorts the characters based on their balance and original position, and prints a new string formed by these characters in the sorted order. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, the final balance `balance`, and a printed string `result` which is a concatenation of characters from `s` sorted by their balance and position.
