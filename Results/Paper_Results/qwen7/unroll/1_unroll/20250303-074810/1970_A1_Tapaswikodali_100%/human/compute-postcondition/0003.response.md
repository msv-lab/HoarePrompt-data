Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Values Needed for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n):` will iterate from `0` to `n-1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `n` must be at least 1 (since `range(n)` will generate numbers from `0` to `n-1`, and if `n` is 0, the range will be empty).

3. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `s` is a string consisting only of characters `(` and `)`, but its value does not affect whether the loop starts or not.
   - The variable `balance` is initialized to 0, and this does not affect the loop starting condition.
   - The variable `balance_info` is an empty list, and again, this does not affect the loop starting condition.
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration, but its initial value does not need to be specified since it will be set by the loop itself.

4. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The only variable that needs adjustment is `n`, which must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
