Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the tuple `(l, r)` which is being iterated over using `ops`. Therefore, the relevant variables here are `l`, `r`, and `ops`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `ops`. Each element in `ops` is a tuple `(l, r)`.

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
   - `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the return values of `func_2(a)`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `ops`, we need to ensure that `ops` is not empty. If `ops` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variables `l` and `r` will take on the values from the tuples in `ops` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify their initial values since they will be assigned within the loop.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `ops` must not be an empty list.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`ops` is not an empty list**.
