Output State: **`ops` now contains one more element which is the sum `s`; `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values; `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. `pos` is not equal to `r`; the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` has been called.**

This means that the function `recursive_maximize_sum` has been called with arguments `pos + 1` and `r`, while all other variables (`ops`, `a`, `l`, `r`, `mx`, and `pos`) retain their original values from the precondition.
