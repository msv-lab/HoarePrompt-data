### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap
- Given an array `a` of integers, we can perform up to \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
- Each operation involves choosing a subarray `[l, r]` and setting all elements in this subarray to the MEX (minimum excluded value) of the subarray.
- The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array.

#### Functions Breakdown

1. **func_1**:
   - This function is supposed to set all elements in the subarray `[l, r]` to the MEX of that subarray.
   - However, the function is incomplete and does not correctly compute the MEX and update the array.

2. **func_2**:
   - This function initializes the process and calls `recursive_maximize_sum` to maximize the sum of the array.

3. **recursive_maximize_sum**:
   - This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]`.
   - If the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements to \(r - l + 1\).
   - Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and recursively maximizes the left and right parts.
   - The logic to find the MEX and update the array is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that setting all elements to the maximum value in the subarray will maximize the sum, which is not always true.

4. **func_3**:
   - This function reads input, calls `func_2`, and prints the result.

#### Issues Identified

1. **func_1**:
   - The function is incomplete and does not correctly compute the MEX and update the array.
   - Specifically, the function does not handle the case where the subarray is a single element correctly.

2. **recursive_maximize_sum**:
   - The logic to find the MEX and update the array is flawed.
   - Setting all elements to the maximum value in the subarray is not always optimal. For example, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 1]`. Setting all elements to 100 would result in `[100, 100, 100, 100]`, but setting the last two elements to 2 would result in `[1, 100, 2, 2]`, which has a higher sum.

3. **Overall Logic**:
   - The approach to finding the MEX and updating the array is not correct. The MEX should be computed properly, and the array should be updated accordingly to ensure the maximum sum.

#### Correct Approach
- To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
  - Compute the MEX for each subarray.
  - Update the array to the MEX value for the chosen subarray.
  - Ensure that the sum of the array is maximized.

#### Conclusion
Given the issues identified in the functions, particularly in `func_1` and `recursive_maximize_sum`, the program is not correctly solving the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
