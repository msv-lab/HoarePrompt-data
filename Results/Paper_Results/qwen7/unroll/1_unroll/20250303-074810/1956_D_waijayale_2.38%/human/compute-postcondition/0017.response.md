Postcondition: `ops` now contains one more element which is the sum `s`; `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values; `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; `pos` is the index of `mx` in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]` plus `l`. `pos` is not equal to `r`. If `pos` is not equal to `l`, the function `recursive_maximize_sum(l, pos - 1)` has been called.
