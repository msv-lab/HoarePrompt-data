Given the initial state and the code snippet:

- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^7\).
- `s`, `m`, and `ops` are the return values of `func_2(a)`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print(s, m)
```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand what `func_2(a)` returns. Since `func_2(a)` is not defined in the problem statement, we cannot determine the exact values of `s` and `m`. However, based on the structure of the problem, we can describe the output in terms of the return values of `func_2(a)`.

Output: **s, m (where s and m are the return values of func_2(a))**
