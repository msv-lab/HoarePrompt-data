Postcondition: `s` is the sum of the elements in list `a` from index `l` to index `r`, inclusive; `ops` is a list that now contains one more element which is the sum `s`; `a`, `l`, and `r` retain their original values; `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`; the current value of `pos` is not equal to `l`.
