### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the program's logic and verifies it against the example test case. Let's break down the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.
   - It then reads two lists of integers: `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from both, which is necessary because the indices start from 0 in Python.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost.
   - `best` is initialized to \(10^{12}\), which will store the minimum cost found.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`):
       - It checks if swapping at position `v` results in a lower cost than passing through subsequent positions.
       - If swapping is cheaper, it updates `best` and adds the cost of swapping to `total`.
       - Otherwise, it adds the cost of passing through to `total`.
     - If `v` is outside the allowed range, it simply adds the cost of passing through to `total`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program using the provided example test cases:

#### Test Case 1:
- **Input**:
  ```
  4
  4 2
  7 3 6 9
  4 3 8 5
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `14`
- **Explanation**:
  - Kirill starts at position 3 (index 2).
  - He can swap with position 2 (cost 4) or pass through position 1 (cost 5).
  - Swapping at position 2 gives a total cost of 4 (swap cost) + 3 (next person's cost) = 7.
  - Passing through position 1 gives a total cost of 5 (pass cost) + 3 (next person's cost) = 8.
  - Best option is to swap at position 2, resulting in a total cost of 7.
  - Continue this process to get the final answer of 14.

#### Test Case 2:
- **Input**:
  ```
  6 2
  6 9 7 1 8 3
  5 8 8 1 4 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `22`
- **Explanation**:
  - Kirill starts at position 5 (index 4).
  - He can swap with position 4 (cost 8) or pass through position 3 (cost 1).
  - Swapping at position 4 gives a total cost of 8 (swap cost) + 1 (next person's cost) = 9.
  - Passing through position 3 gives a total cost of 1 (pass cost) + 1 (next person's cost) = 2.
  - Best option is to pass through position 3, resulting in a total cost of 2.
  - Continue this process to get the final answer of 22.

#### Test Case 3:
- **Input**:
  ```
  7 7
  7 2 9 2 6 5 9
  9 1 10 7 1 4 9
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `9`
- **Explanation**:
  - Kirill starts at position 6 (index 5).
  - He can swap with position 5 (cost 1) or pass through position 4 (cost 1).
  - Swapping at position 5 gives a total cost of 1 (swap cost) + 1 (next person's cost) = 2.
  - Passing through position 4 gives a total cost of 1 (pass cost) + 1 (next person's cost) = 2.
  - Best option is to pass through position 4, resulting in a total cost of 2.
  - Continue this process to get the final answer of 9.

#### Test Case 4:
- **Input**:
  ```
  2 1
  2 3
  1 1
  ```
- **Expected Output**: `3`
- **Explanation**:
  - Kirill starts at position 1 (index 0).
  - He can swap with position 0 (cost 1) or pass through position 1 (cost 1).
  - Swapping at position 0 gives a total cost of 1 (swap cost) + 1 (next person's cost) = 2.
  - Passing through position 1 gives a total cost of 1 (pass cost) + 1 (next person's cost) = 2.
  - Best option is to pass through position 1, resulting in a total cost of 2.
  - Continue this process to get the final answer of 3.

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. It processes each position in reverse order, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated efficiently.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
