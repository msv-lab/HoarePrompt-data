Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it correctly reads the values of `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill), `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position of Kirill), `custo_pra_trocar_a` (cost to swap positions with the person in front), and `custo_pra_passar_b` (cost to pass through the person in front).

2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `na_frente`, `pos_final`, `total`, and `best` are initialized appropriately. `na_frente` and `pos_final` are decremented by 1 to adjust for 0-based indexing.

3. **Loop Logic**: The loop iterates from `na_frente` down to 0, which is correct because it processes each person in the queue from the last person in front of Kirill to the first. This ensures that the cost calculations are done in the correct order.

4. **Cost Calculation**: 
   - If `v` (current index) is less than or equal to `pos_final`, the program calculates the minimum cost between swapping with the current person and passing through them. It updates `best` and `total` accordingly.
   - If `v` is greater than `pos_final`, the program only adds the cost of passing through the current person to `total`.

5. **Output**: The program prints the minimum cost (`best`) for each test case, which is the correct output as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program logic appears to be correct and aligns with the problem description and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
