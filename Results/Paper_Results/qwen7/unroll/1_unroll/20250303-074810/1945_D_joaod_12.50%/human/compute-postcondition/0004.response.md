Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), two integers n and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and two lists a and b of length n (1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9 for all i). The function returns different outputs based on the conditions specified for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and lists, and it processes these inputs according to certain rules without accepting any parameters directly within its definition.
