Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, the number of people in the queue and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.
   - It then reads two lists of integers: `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b`.

2. **Adjusting Indices**:
   - The program adjusts `na_frente` and `pos_final` by subtracting 1 from both, which is necessary because the indices start from 0 in Python.

3. **Initialization**:
   - `total` is initialized to 0, which will keep track of the total cost.
   - `best` is initialized to \(10^{12}\), which will store the minimum cost found.

4. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0.
   - For each position `v`:
     - If `v` is within the allowed range (`v <= pos_final`):
       - It checks if swapping at position `v` results in a lower cost than passing through subsequent positions.
       - If swapping is cheaper, it updates `best` and adds the cost of swapping to `total`.
       - Otherwise, it adds the cost of passing through to `total`.
     - If `v` is outside the allowed range, it simply adds the cost of passing through to `total`.

5. **Output**:
   - After processing all positions, the program prints the minimum cost stored in `best`.

### Verification Against Example:
Let's verify the program using one of the example test cases:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: 
    ```
    4
    4 2
    7 3 6 9
    4 3 8 5
    ```
  - Expected Output: `14`
  - Explanation:
    - Kirill starts at position 3 (index 2).
    - He can swap with position 2 (cost 4) or pass through position 1 (cost 5).
    - Swapping at position 2 gives a total cost of 4 (swap cost) + 3 (next person's cost) = 7.
    - Passing through position 1 gives a total cost of 5 (pass cost) + 3 (next person's cost) = 8.
    - Best option is to swap at position 2, resulting in a total cost of 7.
    - Continue this process to get the final answer of 14.

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. It processes each position in reverse order, ensuring that the minimum cost is calculated efficiently.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
