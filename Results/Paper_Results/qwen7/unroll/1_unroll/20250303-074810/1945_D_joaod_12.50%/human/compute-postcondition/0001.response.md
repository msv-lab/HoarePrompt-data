State: **`cases` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ cases ≤ 10^4, c is 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for c in range(cases):`.
2. The loop variable `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `c` reaches `cases`.
3. For the loop to execute at least once, `c` must be less than `cases`.
4. Therefore, before the loop starts, `c` should be set to 0, and `cases` should be an integer within the specified range.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `c` is initialized to 0, while `cases` remains within its valid range.
