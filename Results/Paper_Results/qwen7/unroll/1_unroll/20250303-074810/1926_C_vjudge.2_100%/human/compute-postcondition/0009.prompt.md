You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
    t = int(input())
    pd = [(0) for _ in range(N)]
    for i in range(1, N):
        pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
        
        for j in str(i):
            pd[i] += int(j)
        
    #State: Output State: `pd` is a list of 400001 elements where each element `pd[i]` (for 1 ≤ i ≤ 400000) contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to i, and `t`, `N`, `n` are unchanged.
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(pd[n])
        
    #State: pd is a list of 400001 elements where each element pd[i] (for 1 ≤ i ≤ 400000) contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to i, t, N, and n are unchanged after the loop executes all iterations. Each time the loop runs, it reads an integer n from input, prints the precomputed sum of digits up to n from the list pd, and does not modify pd or any other variables outside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases (t) where each test case involves an integer n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, it performs some unspecified operation; if n is less than 1 or greater than 2·10^5, it handles this as an error.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
