Output State: **pd is a list of 400001 elements where each element pd[i] (for 1 ≤ i ≤ 400000) contains the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to i, t, N, and n are unchanged after the loop executes all iterations. Each time the loop runs, it reads an integer n from input, prints the precomputed sum of digits up to n from the list pd, and does not modify pd or any other variables outside the loop.**
