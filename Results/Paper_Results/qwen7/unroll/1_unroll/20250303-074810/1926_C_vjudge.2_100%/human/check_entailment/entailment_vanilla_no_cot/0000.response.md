Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect and inefficient for the given problem:

1. **Unnecessary Large Array Initialization**: The array `pd` is initialized to a size of `2 * 10^5 + 1`, which is unnecessarily large. It can be optimized to a smaller size since we only need to store sums up to `n`.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Sum Calculation**: The logic for calculating the sum of digits is flawed. The current implementation tries to accumulate sums in `pd[i]` but does not correctly compute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `i`.

3. **Time Complexity Issue**: The current approach has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loop, which is not efficient given the constraints (`1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`).

### Corrected Solution:
Here's a more efficient and correct approach:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def solve():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    max_n = 2 * 10**5
    digit_sums = [0] * (max_n + 1)
    
    # Precompute the sum of digits for all numbers up to max_n
    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):
        digit_sums[i] = digit_sums[i - 1] + digit_sum(i)
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(digit_sums[n])

solve()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Precomputation**: We precompute the sum of digits for all numbers up to `2 * 10^5` and store them in the `digit_sums` array.
2. **Efficient Querying**: For each test case, we simply query the precomputed array to get the result, which is much faster.

This approach ensures that the solution is both correct and efficient within the given constraints.
