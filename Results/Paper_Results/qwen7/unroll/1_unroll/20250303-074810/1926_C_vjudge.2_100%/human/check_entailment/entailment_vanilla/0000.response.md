Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Array Creation:**
   ```python
   N = int(2 * 100000.0) + 1
   t = int(input())
   pd = [0 for _ in range(N)]
   ```
   - `N` is set to `200001`, which is large enough to cover all possible values up to `2 * 10^5`.
   - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - `pd` is an array of size `N` initialized to 0. This array will store the sum of digits for each number from 0 to `N-1`.

2. **Filling the Array:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, N):
       pd[i] += pd[i - 1]
       for j in str(i):
           pd[i] += int(j)
   ```
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `N-1`.
   - For each number `i`, `pd[i]` is updated by adding the previous value `pd[i-1]` and the sum of its digits.
   - The inner loop converts `i` to a string and adds the integer value of each digit to `pd[i]`.

3. **Processing Test Cases:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(t):
       n = int(input())
       print(pd[n])
   ```
   - For each test case, `n` is read from input.
   - The result is printed as `pd[n]`, which stores the sum of digits for the number `n`.

### Correctness Check

To verify the correctness, let's consider the logic and edge cases:

1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The array `pd` is built such that `pd[i]` contains the sum of digits for all numbers from 0 to `i`.
   - This approach ensures that each number's digit sum is calculated exactly once and reused for subsequent numbers.

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The main loop runs in O(n) where n is the maximum number (`2 * 10^5`), and the inner loop runs in O(log i) for each `i`. Given the constraints, this is efficient.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles large numbers correctly due to the pre-computation of digit sums.
   - It correctly outputs the required results for each test case.

### Conclusion

The given program follows the correct logic and efficiently computes the required sum of digit sums for each number up to `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
