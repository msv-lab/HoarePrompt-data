Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and stores them in the `pd` array. However, this approach is inefficient and unnecessary because the problem only requires calculating the sum of the digits for numbers up to \(n\), where \(n\) can be much smaller than \(2 \times 10^5\).

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  10
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  19
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided program):
  ```
  55
  ```

The program calculates the sum of digits for all numbers from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), which includes many numbers beyond 10. This results in an incorrect sum for the test case where \(n = 10\). The correct approach would be to dynamically calculate the sum of digits for each number up to \(n\) without precomputing sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        total_sum = sum(sum_of_digits(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
        print(total_sum)

func()
```

This corrected program dynamically computes the sum of digits for each number up to \(n\) and accumulates the total sum, ensuring correctness for all inputs within the specified constraints.
