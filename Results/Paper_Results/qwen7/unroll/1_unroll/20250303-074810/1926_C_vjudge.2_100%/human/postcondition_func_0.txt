The function processes a series of test cases (t). For each test case, it reads an integer n from input and prints the precomputed sum of digits from 1 to n based on a preprocessed list `pd`. The function does not modify the preprocessed list `pd` or any other variables outside the loop. If the input n is less than 1 or greater than 2Â·10^5, no action is taken for that specific test case.
