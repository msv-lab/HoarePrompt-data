Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of integers representing the number of pages in each book for each test case. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) indicating the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 representing the number of pages in each book. The function returns information based on the given inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is expected to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of books and their page counts, and process these inputs to provide some form of output based on the given constraints and data.
