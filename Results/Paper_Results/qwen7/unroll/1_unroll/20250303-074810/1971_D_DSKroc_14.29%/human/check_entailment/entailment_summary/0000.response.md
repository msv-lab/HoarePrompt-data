Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit in the binary string. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

To properly solve the problem, we should look for the last occurrence of '0' and the first occurrence of '1'. The number of cuts required will be the index of the first '1' minus the index of the last '0' plus one. This is because once we find these positions, we can split the string at the position right after the last '0' and before the first '1', ensuring all '0's come before all '1's.

The current program instead counts the number of inversions (positions where a digit is greater than the next), which is not relevant to the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
