Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input by the user, within the range 1 â‰¤ `test_cases` â‰¤ 10^4.**

The code reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is stored in the variable `test_cases`. All other variables remain in their initial state, meaning `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m` are not yet defined and retain their initial conditions described in the problem statement.
