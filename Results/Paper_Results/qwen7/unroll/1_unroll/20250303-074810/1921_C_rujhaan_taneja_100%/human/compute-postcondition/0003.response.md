Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the sum of the adjusted values in `array2` plus the cost of the remaining elements is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
