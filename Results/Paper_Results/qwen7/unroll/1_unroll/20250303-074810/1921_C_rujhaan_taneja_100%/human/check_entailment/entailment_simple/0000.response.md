### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`test_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It also reads the list of message times (`arr`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program initializes an empty list `array2` to store the costs associated with turning the phone on and off.
   - It iterates through the list `arr` to calculate the cost of sending messages and turning the phone on/off.
     - For the first message, if the time difference between the current and previous message is less than the cost of turning the phone on and off divided by the charge loss per unit time, the cost is added to `array2`.
     - For subsequent messages, if the time difference between the current and previous message is less than the cost of turning the phone on and off divided by the charge loss per unit time, the cost is added to `array2`.

3. **Calculating Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is calculated as the sum of the costs in `array2` plus the cost of turning the phone on and off for the remaining messages.
   - If this total cost is less than the initial charge `f`, the program prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Cost:**
   - The logic for determining whether to turn the phone on and off is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:` is incorrect because it assumes that turning the phone on and off is necessary whenever the time difference is less than `b / a`. However, this does not account for the actual charge remaining after the previous message.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost calculation should consider the remaining charge after each message and the time until the next message. The current implementation does not correctly handle these calculations.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the phone might run out of charge before reaching the next message, even if turning the phone on and off is considered.

### Corrected Approach:

A more accurate approach would involve calculating the remaining charge after each message and determining if turning the phone on and off is necessary based on the remaining charge and the time until the next message.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:

**False**
