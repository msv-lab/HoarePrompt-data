You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, f, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ f, a, b ≤ 10^9. The list m consists of n integers such that 1 ≤ m_i ≤ 10^9 and m_i < m_{i+1}.
def func():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for i in range(test_cases):
        feat = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        n = feat[0]
        
        f = feat[1]
        
        a = feat[2]
        
        b = feat[-1]
        
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split(' ')]
        
        array2 = []
        
        for i in range(0, n):
            if i == 0:
                if arr[0] < b / a:
                    array2.append(arr[0] * a)
            elif arr[i] - arr[i - 1] < b / a:
                array2.append((arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) * a)
        
        if sum(array2) + (n - len(array2)) * b < f:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' printed for each test case based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if the sum of the adjusted values in `array2` plus the cost of the remaining elements is less than `f`, it prints 'Yes', otherwise it prints 'No'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by `t` sets of integers `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and a list `m` of length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5). For each set, it returns a specific value based on the conditions given.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
