Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `n` (between 3 and 200,000), and three integers `na`, `nb`, and `nc` (each between 1 and `n-2` such that `na + nb + nc = n`). It also takes a list `numbers` of `n` positive integers (each between 1 and 10^9). The function sorts the `numbers` list in descending order. It then checks if it's possible to partition the `numbers` list into three groups (`group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c`) based on certain conditions using `func_1`. If successful, it returns 'YES' along with `group_a` (which contains all elements from the original `numbers` list), an empty `group_b`, and an empty `group_c`. If not possible, it returns 'NO'.**
