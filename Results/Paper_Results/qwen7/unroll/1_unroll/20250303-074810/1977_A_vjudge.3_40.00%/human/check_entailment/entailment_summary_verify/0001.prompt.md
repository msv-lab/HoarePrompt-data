You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m:
            print('Yes')
        elif m > n:
            print('No')
        elif m == n - 1:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 == 0 and n % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        elif m % 2 != 0 and n % 2 != 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \). Based on the values of \( n \) and \( m \), it determines whether to output "Yes" or "No". Specifically, it outputs "Yes" if \( n \) equals \( m \), if \( m \) is one less than \( n \), if both \( n \) and \( m \) are even, or if both \( n \) and \( m \) are odd. Otherwise, it outputs "No". The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Moves can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - If `n == m`, it means that every move added a cube, so it's possible.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means we added a cube `n-1` times and removed 1 cube, which is possible.
   - The conditions involving even and odd numbers need further analysis:
     - If both `n` and `m` are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
     - If both `n` and `m` are odd, it's also possible to achieve `m` cubes.

3. **Reviewing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly checks if `n == m` or `m == n - 1`.
   - It also checks if both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd.
   - However, there is an unnecessary check for `m > n` which is already covered by the condition `m == n - 1`.

4. **Simplifying the Logic:**
   - The logic can be simplified to:
     - Check if `n == m` or `m == n - 1`.
     - Check if both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions are correctly checked, and the program outputs "Yes" or "No" based on these conditions.

Correctness: **True**
