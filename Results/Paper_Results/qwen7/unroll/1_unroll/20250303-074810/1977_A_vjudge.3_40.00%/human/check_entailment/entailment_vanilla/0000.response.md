### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves.
   - Moves can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube from the top of the tower.

2. **Analyzing the Conditions:**
   - If `n == m`, it means that every move added a cube, so it's possible.
   - If `m > n`, it's impossible because we can't add more cubes than the number of moves.
   - If `m == n - 1`, it means we added a cube `n-1` times and removed 1 cube, which is possible.
   - The conditions involving even and odd numbers need further analysis:
     - If both `n` and `m` are even, it's possible to achieve `m` cubes.
     - If both `n` and `m` are odd, it's also possible to achieve `m` cubes.

3. **Reviewing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly checks if `n == m` or `m == n - 1`.
   - It also checks if both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd.
   - However, there is an unnecessary check for `m > n` which is already covered by the condition `m == n - 1`.

4. **Simplifying the Logic:**
   - The logic can be simplified to:
     - Check if `n == m` or `m == n - 1`.
     - Check if both `n` and `m` are even or both are odd.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The conditions are correctly checked, and the program outputs "Yes" or "No" based on these conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
