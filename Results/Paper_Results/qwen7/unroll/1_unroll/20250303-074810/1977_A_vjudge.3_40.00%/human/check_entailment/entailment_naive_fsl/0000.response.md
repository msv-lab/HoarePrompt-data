Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the case where `m` is odd and `n` is even, or vice versa. According to the problem description, Nikita can only add or remove one cube per move, which means the total number of cubes (`m`) after `n` moves will always have the same parity (odd or even) as `n`. 

For example, if `n` is even and `m` is odd, or if `n` is odd and `m` is even, it is impossible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves. However, the current implementation does not check this condition, leading to incorrect results in such cases. 

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure that `n` and `m` have the same parity before printing "Yes". Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if n == m or (n % 2 == m % 2):
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the parity of `n` and `m` is checked, making the solution correct for all potential cases.
