### Reasoning

Let's analyze the provided code and the problem description to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The grid has 2 rows and \( n \) columns.
- Arrows point either left (<) or right (>). No arrow points outside the grid.
- The robot starts at (1, 1) and moves according to the arrows.
- The goal is to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

#### Provided Code Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**
   - This function aims to check if the robot can reach (2, n).
   - It iterates over the first half of the grid (up to \( n/2 - 1 \)).
   - It checks if the robot can move left and then down to (2, n) based on the arrow directions.
   - If any invalid condition is found, it returns 'No'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2`**
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1` with the appropriate parameters.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

#### Function Summaries
- **Function `func_1`**: Checks if the robot can reach (2, n) based on the given grid configuration.
- **Function `func_2`**: Reads input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

#### Detailed Analysis
1. **Function `func_1`**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only checks a few specific conditions without simulating the full path.
   - It does not account for the possibility of the robot moving up or down multiple times to reach (2, n).
   - It assumes that if the robot can move left and then down, it will always reach (2, n), which is not necessarily true.

2. **Function `func_2`**
   - The function correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the overall solution is flawed.

#### Test Case Analysis
Let's consider the provided test case:
```
Input:
4
6
>>><<<
><>>><
```

- The robot starts at (1, 1).
- Moves right to (1, 2).
- Moves right to (1, 3).
- Moves left to (1, 2).
- Moves right to (1, 3).
- Moves right to (1, 4).
- Moves right to (1, 5).
- Moves right to (1, 6).
- Moves down to (2, 6).

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 6), but the provided solution fails to correctly simulate this path.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The provided solution does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid and fails to handle all possible configurations of arrows. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
