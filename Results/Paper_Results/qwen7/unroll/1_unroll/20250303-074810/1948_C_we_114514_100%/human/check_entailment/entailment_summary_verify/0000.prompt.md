You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(n, row1, row2):
    """
    判断机器人是否能够从 (1,1) 到达 (2,n)。
    """
    half_n = n // 2
    for i in range(half_n - 1):
        if row1[2 * i + 1] == '<' and (row2[2 * i] == '<' or row2[2 * i + 2] == '<'):
            return 'No'
    if row1[n - 1] == '<' and row2[n - 2] == '<':
        return 'No'
    return 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    """
    读取输入并处理每个测试用例。
    """
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input()
        row2 = input()
        results.append(func_1(n, row1, row2))
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function reads multiple test cases from standard input. For each test case, it takes an integer \( t \) (number of cases), an even integer \( n \) (length of two input strings), and two strings \( row1 \) and \( row2 \) of length \( n \) consisting of '<' and '>' characters. It then calls another function `func_1` for each test case, passing \( n \), \( row1 \), and \( row2 \) as arguments. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of these calls, one per line, to standard output.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem description. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Determining Path**: The logic in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the robot's movement through the grid. It only checks a few specific conditions without fully considering all possible paths the robot could take.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The function does not handle all possible configurations of arrows in the grid. For example, it does not consider cases where the robot might need to move up or down multiple times to reach the target cell.

3. **Incomplete Path Simulation**: The function does not simulate the robot's movement step-by-step across the entire grid, which is necessary to ensure the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
Input:
4
6
>>><<<
><>>><
```

The provided solution would incorrectly return "Yes" because it does not properly simulate the robot's path. However, the correct path for this case is:

- Start at (1, 1)
- Move right to (1, 2)
- Move right to (1, 3)
- Move left to (1, 2)
- Move right to (1, 3)
- Move right to (1, 4)
- Move right to (1, 5)
- Move right to (1, 6)
- Move down to (2, 6)

This path shows that the robot can indeed reach (2, 6), but the provided solution fails to correctly simulate this path.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the output is **False**.
