State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the loop variables**: The loop variables in the given for loop are `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 0 (as specified in the range function).
3. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
4. **Other variables**: The variables `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` are not involved in the loop condition or loop body, so their current states do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are to ensure `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
