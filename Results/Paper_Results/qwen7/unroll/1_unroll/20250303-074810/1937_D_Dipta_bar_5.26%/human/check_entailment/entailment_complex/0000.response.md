### Reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and compute the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Logic Breakdown**:
   - **Forward Pass (`A`)**: The function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell going forward. This is done by iterating through the string and updating the `A` array based on the positions of '>' characters.
   - **Backward Pass (`B`)**: Similarly, the function calculates the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell going backward. This is done by iterating through the string in reverse and updating the `B` array based on the positions of '<' characters.
   - **Final Calculation**: The function then uses the `A` and `B` arrays to compute the total time for each cell by considering both the forward and backward movements and adjusting for the current cell's position.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - When the pinball starts at a cell with a '>' character, it moves forward until it reaches the end of the grid.
   - When the pinball starts at a cell with a '<' character, it moves backward until it reaches the beginning of the grid.
   - The function handles edge cases where the pinball might start at the boundary cells directly.

4. **Output**: The function correctly prints the time it takes for the pinball to leave the grid for each cell, as demonstrated in the example.

### Conclusion:

Given the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The calculations and logic seem sound, and the output matches the expected results as shown in the example.
