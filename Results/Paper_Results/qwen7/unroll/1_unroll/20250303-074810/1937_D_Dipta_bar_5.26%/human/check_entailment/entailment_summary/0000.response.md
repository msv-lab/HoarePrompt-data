Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic and the expected behavior step-by-step.

1. **Function `func_1` Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to process a string `s` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and compute the time it would take for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

2. **Algorithm Breakdown**:
   - **Left-to-Right Calculation (`A`)**: This part calculates the time taken for a pinball to reach the left boundary starting from each position where there is a '>'.
   - **Right-to-Left Calculation (`B`)**: This part calculates the time taken for a pinball to reach the right boundary starting from each position where there is a '<'.
   - **Combining Results**: The final result for each cell is computed by combining the results from the left-to-right and right-to-left calculations.

3. **Complexity Analysis**:
   - The algorithm uses prefix and suffix sums to efficiently compute the time taken for the pinball to move.
   - The complexity of the algorithm seems to be linear with respect to the length of the string, making it efficient for large inputs.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the pinball starts at the boundary or when there are no '<' or '>' characters in the string.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement. For each test case, the program correctly computes and prints the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The algorithm is sound, and the implementation handles all necessary cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
