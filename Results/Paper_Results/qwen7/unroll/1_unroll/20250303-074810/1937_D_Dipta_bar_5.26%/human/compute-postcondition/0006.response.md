Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the positions of '>' in `s`, `idx_A` is a list of indices where each index corresponds to the position of '>' in `s`, `B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `B = []` creates an empty list `B`. The values of `s`, `A`, and `idx_A` remain unchanged from their initial state.
