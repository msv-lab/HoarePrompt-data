The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', where `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5`. The function returns a value based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in the string `s`. Specifically, if the number of '<' characters is greater than the number of '>' characters, the function returns the difference. If the number of '>' characters is greater, it returns the negative difference. If the numbers are equal, it returns 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, and returns the difference between the count of '<' and '>' characters. If counts are equal, it returns 0.**
