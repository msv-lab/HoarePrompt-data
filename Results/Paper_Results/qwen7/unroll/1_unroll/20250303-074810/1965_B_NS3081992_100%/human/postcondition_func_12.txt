The function accepts two non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, where `b` is not zero. It returns a tuple containing three values: either `(1, 0, a)` when `b` is zero (which cannot happen due to the precondition), or `y, x - a // b * y, and g`, where `y, x, and g` are the results of recursively calling itself with `b` and `a % b`. The function ultimately computes and returns values related to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
