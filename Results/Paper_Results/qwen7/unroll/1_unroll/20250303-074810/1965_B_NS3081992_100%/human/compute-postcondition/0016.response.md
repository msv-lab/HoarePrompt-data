Output State: **`ans` is an empty list, `n` is an integer between 2 and \(10^6\), `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `b` is a binary string representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `bk` is a binary string representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `lk` is the length of `bk`, and `k` is not equal to 1.**

Explanation: The code `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary string representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to `lk`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
