Reasoning:
1. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1(), func_2(), func_3(), func_4(), func_5(), func_6(), func_7(), func_8(), func_9(), func_10(), func_11(), func_12(), func_13()**: These functions do not directly contribute to solving the problem. They either read input in various ways or perform operations unrelated to the problem requirements.
   - **func_14()**: This function correctly implements the logic to generate the required sequence `a` based on the given `n` and `k`. It handles both cases where `k` is 1 and where `k` is not 1.
   - **func_15()**: This function correctly processes the test cases by calling `func_14()` for each test case and printing the results.

2. **Problem Requirements**:
   - The problem requires generating a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
     - There is no subsequence of `a` with a sum of `k`.
     - For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

3. **Function `func_14()`**:
   - When `k` is 1, it returns a sequence `[2, 3, 4, 8, 16, ..., 2^(l-1)]` where `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`. This ensures that no subsequence sums to 1 and all other numbers from 2 to `n` can be formed.
   - When `k` is not 1, it constructs a sequence that avoids subsequences summing to `k` while ensuring all other numbers from 1 to `n` can be formed as subsequences.

4. **Function `func_15()`**:
   - It correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by calling `func_14()` and printing the results.

Given the analysis, the functions `func_14()` and `func_15()` together correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
