Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while pos != len(sorted_indices)`. The variables involved here are `pos` and `len(sorted_indices)`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.

3. **Current state before the loop**: 
   - `distance` is 0.
   - `pos` is 0.

4. **Check the condition with the current state**:
   - `pos` is currently 0.
   - `len(sorted_indices)` is unknown, but we need to ensure that `pos` is not equal to `len(sorted_indices)` for the loop to execute.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `pos` must not be equal to `len(sorted_indices)`.
   - Since `pos` is currently 0, `len(sorted_indices)` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `len(sorted_indices)` is greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`distance` is 0, `pos` is 0, and `len(sorted_indices)` must be greater than 0**
