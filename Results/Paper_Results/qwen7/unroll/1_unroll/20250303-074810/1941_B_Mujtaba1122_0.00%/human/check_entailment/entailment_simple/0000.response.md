Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero by performing a specific operation any number of times. The operation involves choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and reducing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by certain amounts.

2. **Analysis of Provided Functions**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to reduce the elements of the list according to the specified operation. It iterates through the list from index 1 to \(n-2\) and applies the operation as long as the conditions are met. After attempting to reduce the elements, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are now zero. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operation and checks if the result can make all elements zero.
   - The state transitions and operations described match the problem statement.
   - The final check with `func_1` ensures that the transformation is complete before deciding whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
