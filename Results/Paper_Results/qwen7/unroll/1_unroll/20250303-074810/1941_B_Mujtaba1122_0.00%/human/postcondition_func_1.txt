The function accepts a list of integers and an integer `n`. It iterates through the list (excluding the first and last elements) and, for each element, if it is greater than 1 and its adjacent elements are also greater than 0, it reduces the current element by twice the value of the previous element, the previous element by itself, and the next element by the value of the previous element. This process continues until no further reductions can be made under the given conditions. Finally, it calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The list is modified during the process, but the boundary elements remain unchanged.
