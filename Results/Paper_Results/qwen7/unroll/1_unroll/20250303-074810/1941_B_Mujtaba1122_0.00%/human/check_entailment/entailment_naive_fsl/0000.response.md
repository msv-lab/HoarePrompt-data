Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero. Specifically, the function `func_2` does not properly handle the decrement operations according to the rules specified. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  1 3 5 5 2
  ```

The expected steps to make all elements zero would be:
1. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3`
   - `a_5 = a_5 - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1`
   Resulting array: `[1, 3, 3, 3, 1]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=3`:
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 2 = 3 - 2 = 1`
   - `a_4 = a_4 - 1 = 3 - 1 = 2`
   Resulting array: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
3. Apply the operation at `i=2`:
   - `a_1 = a_1 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
   - `a_2 = a_2 - 2 = 2 - 2 = 0`
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0`
   Resulting array: `[0, 0, 0, 2, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`:
   - `a_3 = a_3 - 1 = 0 - 1 = -1` (Invalid operation as it results in a negative value)
   
Since the program does not handle the decrement operations correctly and may result in invalid states (like negative values), it fails to correctly determine if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
