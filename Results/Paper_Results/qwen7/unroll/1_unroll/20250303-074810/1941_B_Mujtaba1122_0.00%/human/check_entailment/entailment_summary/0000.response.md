Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation any number of times.
2. The operation involves choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and reducing three elements in the array: \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\).
3. Function `func_2` attempts to perform these operations and check if all elements can be reduced to zero.
4. The key logic in `func_2` is to repeatedly apply the operation as long as the conditions are met (i.e., \(a_i > 1\) and both \(a_{i-1} > 0\) and \(a_{i+1} > 0\)).
5. After attempting to reduce the elements, `func_2` calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the array are zero.
6. `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the list are zero and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

Given the execution summaries and the logic described, the implementation in `func_2` seems to correctly follow the problem statement and the constraints. It performs the necessary operations and uses `func_1` to validate the result accurately.

Correctness: **True**
