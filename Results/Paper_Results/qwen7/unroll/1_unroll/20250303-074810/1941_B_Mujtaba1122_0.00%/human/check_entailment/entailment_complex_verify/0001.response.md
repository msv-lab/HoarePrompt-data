### Reasoning

Let's systematically evaluate the program based on the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **State Before Call**: `list` is a list of non-negative integers, and `n` is the length of the list.
- **Behavior**: Iterates through the list and checks if any element is non-zero.
- **Output**: Returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise returns `False`.
- **State After Call**: The list and `n` remain unchanged.

#### Function `func_2`:
- **State Before Call**: `list` is a list of integers representing the array `a`, and `n` is the length of the list.
- **Behavior**:
  - Iterates through the list from index 1 to `n-2`.
  - For each index `i`, checks if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
  - If the conditions are met, performs the operation:
    - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
    - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
    - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
  - Continues until no further operations can be performed.
  - Calls `func_1(list, n)` to check if all elements are zero.
  - Prints 'YES' if all elements are zero, otherwise prints 'NO'.
- **State After Call**: The list may be modified, but the boundary elements (`list[0]` and `list[n-1]`) remain unchanged.

#### Overall Program Flow:
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case:
  - Reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
  - Calls `func_2(list, n)` to attempt to make all elements zero.
  - Prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the result.

### Analysis of Correctness:

1. **Operation Effectiveness**:
   - The operation reduces `a_{i-1}` by 1, `a_i` by 2, and `a_{i+1}` by 1.
   - This effectively reduces `a_i` by 2, which is essential for making the array elements zero.

2. **Algorithm Logic**:
   - The algorithm iterates through the array and applies the operation whenever possible.
   - It ensures that the operation can only be applied when the necessary conditions are met (`a_i > 1` and both neighbors are greater than 0).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if all elements are zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The algorithm correctly handles cases where no valid `i` exists for the operation.
   - It correctly identifies such cases and prints 'NO'.

4. **Boundary Elements**:
   - The boundary elements (`list[0]` and `list[n-1]`) are not modified during the process, ensuring that the algorithm focuses on the interior elements.

5. **Final Check**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly checks if all elements are zero after the operations.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to achieve this goal without any logical errors.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
