The function processes pairs of input strings `a` and `b`, which are lists of integers. For each pair, it generates two new strings `new` and `new2`. `new` contains the maximum value at each position where `a` and `b` differ or when they are different from the previous matching pair. `new2` contains the minimum value at each position where `a` and `b` differ or when they are different from the previous matching pair. After processing all pairs, it prints the final `new` and `new2` strings.
