### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the provided function summary against the problem description and the original assessment.

#### Problem Description:
The task is to count the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\)
2. \(1 \le b \le m\)
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\)

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        count = 2
        ans = n
        while count <= m:
            countmins = int(count - 1)
            g = int(n / count)
            if g < countmins:
                break
            g -= countmins
            ans += int(g / count) + 1
            count += 1
        print(int(ans))
```

#### Function Summary:
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). It calculates a value \( ans \) based on \( n \) and \( m \) using a specific algorithm involving a loop. The function outputs the calculated value \( ans \) for each test case.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** False
- **Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on a simplified approach that does not fully account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Analysis:
1. **Algorithm Analysis:**
   - The given program uses a loop to incrementally adjust `ans` based on a heuristic that doesn't fully capture the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - The logic inside the loop seems to be an attempt to approximate the count but fails to cover all valid pairs.

2. **Correct Solution:**
   - The original assessment suggested a more accurate solution that iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly.
   - This direct approach ensures that all valid pairs are counted accurately.

3. **Given Program Evaluation:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as stated. It misses some valid pairs and incorrectly counts others.
   - The heuristic used in the given program is not sufficient to ensure all valid pairs are counted.

#### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
