Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to count valid pairs \((a, b)\) based on a simplified approach that does not fully account for the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To illustrate, consider the test case \(n = 10\) and \(m = 8\):

- According to the problem statement, valid pairs include \((1, 1), (2, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (6, 1), (6, 2), (6, 3), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1), (10, 2), (10, 3), (10, 4)\), which totals 16 pairs.
- However, the program outputs 14 pairs, indicating it misses some valid pairs.

A more accurate solution would involve iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking the condition directly. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def gcd(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
    return x

def count_valid_pairs(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        print(count_valid_pairs(n, m))

func()
```

This corrected version iterates through all possible pairs and checks the condition directly, ensuring all valid pairs are counted.
