Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object involved here is `int(input())`, which reads an integer from the input.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value. Given the state before the loop starts, we know that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `int(input())` will always provide a valid input for the loop to execute since `t` is guaranteed to be within the specified range.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`, no adjustments are needed for the loop to start executing. The only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is read correctly from the input.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts does not need to be adjusted further because the loop will always execute based on the given constraints.

**State:**
**No adjustment needed. The loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`.**
