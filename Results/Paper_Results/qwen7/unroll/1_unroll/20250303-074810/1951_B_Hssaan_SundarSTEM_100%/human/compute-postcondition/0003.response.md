Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t`, followed by `t` test cases. Each test case consists of three integers `n`, `k`, and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers where each integer in `a` is between 1 and 10^9. For each test case, the function processes the list `a` and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function `func` takes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, it receives integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` containing `n` unique integers. The function then performs some operation based on these inputs but does not specify what exactly, only that it returns a value after processing each test case.
