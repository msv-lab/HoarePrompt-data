Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `t in range(int(input()))`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `t`**: The initial state given is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is within the specified range. If `t` is less than 1 or greater than \(10^4\), the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the value of `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is within this range when the loop starts.

**State:**
- `t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

Thus, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
