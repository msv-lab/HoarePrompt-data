Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It then reads `n` and `k` for each test case.

2. **Odd Number Cards:**
   - The program calculates the number of odd-numbered cards using `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - If `k` is greater than half of `n`, it means the `k`-th card is not among the first half (odd-numbered cards).

3. **Even Number Cards:**
   - For even-numbered cards, the program calculates the position relative to the remaining cards.
   - It uses a loop to adjust the count of remaining cards `d` and increments the index `i`.

4. **Position Calculation:**
   - After determining the relevant group of cards (even or odd), it calculates the exact position within that group.
   - The formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` is used to find the `k`-th card in the sequence of even-numbered cards.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the case where `k` is within the first half of the cards (all odd numbers).
   - It also handles the case where `k` is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards.

### Detailed Reasoning

1. **Odd Number Cards:**
   - The logic for handling odd-numbered cards is correct. The first half of the cards are all odd numbers, and the program correctly identifies when `k` falls into this category.

2. **Even Number Cards:**
   - The logic for handling even-numbered cards is also correct. The program correctly identifies the group of even-numbered cards and calculates the position within that group.

3. **Formula Usage:**
   - The formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)` is derived from the pattern of laying down cards. This formula correctly maps the position `f` to the actual card number.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles edge cases such as when `k` is exactly at the boundary between odd and even-numbered cards.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and formulas used are correct according to the problem description. The program correctly identifies the type of card (odd or even) and calculates the exact position within that group.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
