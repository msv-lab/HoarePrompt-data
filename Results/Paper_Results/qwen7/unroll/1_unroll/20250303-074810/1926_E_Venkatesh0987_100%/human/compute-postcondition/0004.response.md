Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value \( y \) based on the relationship between \( n \), \( k \), and the number of test cases \( t \) (where \( 1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 \)). If \( k \) is greater than half of \( n + 1 \), it computes \( y \) using a specific formula involving binary operations. Otherwise, it simply prints \( 2k - 1 \).**
