You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

After all the executions of the loop have finished, the value of `y` is printed for each test case based on the conditions given in the loop body. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`) are used during the computation but their final values do not affect the output.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program attempts to handle the case where `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, but it does not correctly generate the sequence of cards as described.

Let's consider the following test case:
- Input: `8 6`
- Expected Output: `6`

According to the problem description, the sequence of cards laid down would be:
1. Odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7
2. Cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6
3. Cards that are three times an odd number: 4, 12 (but since we only have up to 8, only 4 is included)

So the sequence should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.

However, the program incorrectly outputs `6` for `k = 6`. This happens because the program does not correctly handle the placement of the cards that are multiples of odd numbers. Instead of correctly identifying and placing these cards, the program uses a formula that does not match the described process.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly simulate the process of laying down the cards according to the rules specified in the problem description.
