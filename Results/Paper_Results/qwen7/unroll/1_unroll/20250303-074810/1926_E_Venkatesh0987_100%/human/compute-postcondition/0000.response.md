Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value, which is used as the argument to the `range()` function.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - The initial state is given as `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\).
   - This means that `t` represents the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the input value must be within the range specified by `t`.
   - Therefore, the input value (which is the number of iterations) must be equal to `t`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value, which should be set to `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\) and the input value must be equal to `t`**
