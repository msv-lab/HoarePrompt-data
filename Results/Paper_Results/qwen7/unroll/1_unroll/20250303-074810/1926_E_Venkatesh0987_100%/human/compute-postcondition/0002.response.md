Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After all the executions of the loop have finished, the value of `y` is printed for each test case based on the conditions given in the loop body. The other variables (`s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, `f`) are used during the computation but their final values do not affect the output.
