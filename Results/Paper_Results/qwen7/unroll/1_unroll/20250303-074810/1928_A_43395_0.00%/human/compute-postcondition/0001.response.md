Output State: The output state will consist of 'yes' or 'no' printed for each test case based on the conditions provided in the loop. For each test case, if both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'. If `a - b` or `b - a` results in a negative value with specific conditions, it prints 'no'. Otherwise, if the difference between `a` and `b` is odd, it prints 'yes', otherwise 'no'.
