Output State: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, and for each input string `s`, the variable `count` is printed after processing the string according to the given logic. If the string contains at least one occurrence of '01', `count` is decremented by 1 before printing. The value of `flag` is used to determine if the decrement should occur.
