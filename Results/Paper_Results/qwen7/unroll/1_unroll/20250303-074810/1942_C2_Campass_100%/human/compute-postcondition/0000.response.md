Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting it to integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` which takes input from the user and splits it into multiple integers, converting them to integers. This function does not assign values to any existing variables but rather creates a new function that can be used later to read input. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and any lists of integers from vertices are not affected by this code. Therefore, `t` remains as an integer within the specified range, and `R` is now a callable lambda function.
