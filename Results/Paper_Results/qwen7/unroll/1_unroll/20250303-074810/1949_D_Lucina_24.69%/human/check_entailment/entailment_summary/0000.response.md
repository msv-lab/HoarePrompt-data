Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The function correctly processes the input by reading the grid and counting the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each row, storing these counts in lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Grouping Rows**: The function categorizes the rows into two groups (`sa` and `sb`) based on whether they have more 'F' or 'S'. This step is correct as it helps in determining which type of transition video to assign to the undecided cells ('?').

3. **Assigning Values to Undecided Cells**: 
   - If the number of rows in `sa` is greater than or equal to the number of rows in `sb`, the function assigns 'F' to the undecided cells under certain conditions.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'S' to the undecided cells under certain conditions.
   
   However, there are several issues with this approach:
   - The function does not ensure that the condition `no more than \lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil consecutive videos of the same type` is met for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The logic for assigning 'F' or 'S' to the undecided cells is overly simplistic and does not account for the overall sequence of transition videos across all permutations of scenarios.
   - The function does not handle the case where both `sa` and `sb` have fewer than \( \frac{n}{4} \) elements, which could lead to incorrect assignments.

4. **Output**: The function prints the modified grid, but the logic used to fill in the undecided cells is flawed and does not guarantee the required constraint.

Given these points, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as stated. The function fails to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear in any sequence of scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
