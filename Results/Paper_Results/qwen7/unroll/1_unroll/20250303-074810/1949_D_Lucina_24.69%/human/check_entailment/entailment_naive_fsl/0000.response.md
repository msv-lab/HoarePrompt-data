Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the full transition video plan according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic used to decide whether a `?` should be replaced with `F` or `S` is flawed. 

Consider the following input:

```
5
.??F?
.??.?
F?.?.
???.?
????.?
```

The program's output for this input is:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFSF
```

However, this output does not satisfy the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type should appear for any permutation of the scenarios. For example, in the permutation \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\), the sequence of transition videos would be `FFFFF`, which has 5 consecutive `F`s, violating the constraint since \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\).

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that for any permutation of the scenarios, the number of consecutive `F`s or `S`s does not exceed \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\). The current implementation does not guarantee this, as it simply assigns `F` or `S` based on a fixed rule without considering the overall sequence constraints.
