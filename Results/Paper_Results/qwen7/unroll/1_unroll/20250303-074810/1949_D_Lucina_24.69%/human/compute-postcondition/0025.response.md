Output State: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24, `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from the input for each index, `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from the input for each index, `xx` is a list containing n elements, each being the input string received during each iteration of the loop, `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`, `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` with the additional condition that `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for those indices added in the loop, and after executing the loop, `sb` contains indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0` with the additional condition that `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` for those indices added in the loop.
