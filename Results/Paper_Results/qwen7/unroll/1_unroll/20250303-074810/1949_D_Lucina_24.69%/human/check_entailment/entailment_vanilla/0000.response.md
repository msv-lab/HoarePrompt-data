### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to fill in the undecided transition videos (`?`) in such a way that no matter the order of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type appear.
   - The input provides a partially filled matrix where `F` means funny, `S` means scary, and `.` means undecided.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of scenarios \( n \) and the partially filled matrix.
   - It counts the number of `F` and `S` transitions for each scenario and stores these counts in arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It identifies scenarios that are already decided to be `F` or `S` and categorizes them into `sa` (for `F`) and `sb` (for `S`).
   - Depending on the size of `sa` and `sb`, it decides how to fill the remaining undecided transitions (`?`).

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Transitions:**
     - The code attempts to fill undecided transitions (`?`) based on whether the scenario index is in the first quarter of `sa` or `sb`. This logic is flawed because it does not ensure the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type.
   - **Incorrect Logic for Deciding `F` or `S`:**
     - The logic for deciding `F` or `S` for undecided transitions is overly simplistic and does not consider the global constraint of the problem.
   - **Incomplete Implementation:**
     - The code does not handle the case where both `sa` and `sb` are non-empty and their sizes are not balanced in a way that ensures the constraint is met.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure the constraint is met. This might involve backtracking or a greedy algorithm that tries to balance the number of `F` and `S` transitions while ensuring the constraint is not violated.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It fails to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transitions of the same type appear in any permutation of scenarios.

**Correctness: False**
