Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, and the list `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n` remain unchanged.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained within the range [1, 10^4], while the other variables and the list `m` retain their initial conditions as specified in the precondition.
