### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.
   - Given \( a_i \), we can determine the MEX up to index \( i \).
   - We need to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) matches the given \( a \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the MEX and used numbers.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX values.
   - The logic inside `func_1` seems to correctly handle both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) to determine the MEX and update the used numbers.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - When \( a_i > 0 \), it directly appends the current MEX value to the result and updates the used numbers.
     - This part of the logic is correct because if \( a_i > 0 \), it means that the MEX up to index \( i \) is simply the next available non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet.
   - When \( a_i \leq 0 \), it calculates the MEX by subtracting the absolute value of \( a_i \) from the current MEX and updates the used numbers.
     - This part of the logic is also correct because if \( a_i \leq 0 \), it means that the MEX up to index \( i \) is the smallest non-negative integer that hasn't been used yet, adjusted by the value of \( a_i \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) correctly.
   - It ensures that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the given conditions.
   - The use of `used` dictionary ensures that each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) is used exactly once, which is a requirement for a permutation.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations. The code accurately reconstructs the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \) and satisfies all the necessary conditions.
