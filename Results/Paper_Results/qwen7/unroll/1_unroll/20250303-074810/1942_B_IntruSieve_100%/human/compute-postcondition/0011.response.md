Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` for each test case. It calculates and prints a list `mex` which contains non-negative integers. Each element in `mex` represents the smallest non-negative integer not present in the original list `a`. The function does not return any value but prints the elements of `mex` one by one.**
