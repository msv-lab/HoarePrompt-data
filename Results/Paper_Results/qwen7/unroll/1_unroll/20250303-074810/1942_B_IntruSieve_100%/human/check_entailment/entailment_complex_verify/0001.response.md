### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to reconstruct a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \). The MEX of a set is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The MEX of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - Given \( a_i \), we can determine the MEX up to index \( i \).
   - We need to ensure that the constructed permutation \( p \) matches the given \( a \).

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes variables to keep track of the MEX (`minn`) and used numbers (`used`).
   - It iterates through the array \( a \) and constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the MEX values.
   - The logic inside `func_1` seems to correctly handle both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) to determine the MEX and update the used numbers.

4. **Checking the Logic**:
   - When \( a_i > 0 \), it directly appends the current MEX value to the result and updates the used numbers.
     ```python
     if arr[i] > 0:
         mex.append(minn)
         used[minn] = True
         while minn in used:
             minn += 1
     ```
   - When \( a_i \leq 0 \), it calculates the MEX by subtracting the absolute value of \( a_i \) from the current MEX and updates the used numbers.
     ```python
     else:
         mex.append(abs(arr[i] - minn))
         used[abs(arr[i] - minn)] = True
     ```

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles both positive and negative values of \( a_i \) correctly.
   - It ensures that the constructed permutation \( p \) satisfies the given conditions.

6. **Detailed Verification Using Annotated Code**:
   - Before the loop, `minn` starts at 0, and `used` is an empty dictionary.
   - During the loop, `minn` is incremented appropriately to ensure it is the smallest non-negative integer not in `used`.
   - The `mex` list is built correctly based on the MEX values derived from `a`.
   - After the loop, the `mex` list is printed, which should match the required permutation \( p \).

7. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code correctly implements the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
