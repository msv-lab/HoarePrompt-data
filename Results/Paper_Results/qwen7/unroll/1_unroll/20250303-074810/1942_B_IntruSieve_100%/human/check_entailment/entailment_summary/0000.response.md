Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). However, the implementation has some issues that need to be addressed:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program tries to calculate the MEX for each element in the array \( a \), but it does not correctly follow the logic of the MEX definition. Specifically, the program uses a variable `minn` to keep track of the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current subarray, but it does not correctly handle the logic when `arr[i]` is negative.

2. **Handling Negative Values**: When `arr[i]` is negative, the program subtracts `abs(arr[i])` from `minn`, which is incorrect. According to the problem statement, if `a_i` is negative, it should be interpreted as `MEX(p_1, p_2, ..., p_i) - p_i`, where `p_i` is the current element being considered. This means we need to adjust `minn` by adding `abs(arr[i])` to it, not subtracting.

3. **Output Format**: The program prints the elements of `mex` directly without constructing the permutation \( p \) explicitly. The problem requires constructing and printing the permutation \( p \), not just the MEX values.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
