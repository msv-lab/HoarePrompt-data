Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function `func_1()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Initialization**: Inside `func_1()`, `n` is correctly initialized as the length of the array `a`, and `arr` is correctly populated with the input integers. This part is also correct.

3. **MEX Calculation**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the MEX for each position in the array `arr`.
   - However, the logic for calculating MEX is flawed. Specifically, the variable `minn` is used to track the smallest unused integer, but the logic for updating `minn` when a previously used value is encountered is incorrect. Instead of incrementing `minn` when a value is found in `used`, the code should directly set `minn` to the next integer after the last used value.
   - The current implementation of `while minn in used:` is unnecessary and incorrect because it can lead to an infinite loop if `minn` is never incremented properly.

4. **Output**:
   - The code prints the calculated MEX values for each position in the array `arr`.
   - However, the MEX values are not necessarily a valid permutation of the integers from 0 to n-1. The current implementation does not ensure that the resulting `mex` list forms a valid permutation.

Given these points, the current implementation does not guarantee that the output is a valid permutation `p` that satisfies the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

Correctness: **False**
