Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, `t` is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `n` is now set to the input integer which is within the range 1 to 2⋅10^5.
