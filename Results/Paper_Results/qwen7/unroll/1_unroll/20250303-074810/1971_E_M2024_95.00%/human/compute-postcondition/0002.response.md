Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing the result of `q` queries. For each query, the program calculates and prints the interpolated value based on the given sequences `a` and `b`, using linear interpolation between the points defined by the differences in `ad` and `bd`. The output is the result of these calculations for each of the `q` queries in each of the `t` test cases.
