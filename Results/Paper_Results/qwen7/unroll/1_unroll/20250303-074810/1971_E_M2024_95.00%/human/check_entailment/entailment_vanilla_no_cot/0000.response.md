Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `q` followed by the positions `a` and times `b`.

2. **Calculating Speed Segments**: It calculates the distances between consecutive points in `a` and the corresponding differences in times in `b`. Then, it computes the speed for each segment using these differences.

3. **Query Handling**: For each query, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the segment where the queried position `d` lies. If `d` exactly matches a known position, it directly outputs the corresponding time. Otherwise, it interpolates the time for the segment containing `d`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the time for each query, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program should handle all cases correctly, making the correctness evaluation **True**.
