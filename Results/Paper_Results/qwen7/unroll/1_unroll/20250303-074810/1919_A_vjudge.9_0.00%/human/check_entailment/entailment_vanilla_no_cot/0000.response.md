Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Game Analysis:**
   - Each player can either swap wallets or remove one coin from their own wallet.
   - The game ends when a player cannot make a valid move (i.e., their wallet has 0 coins).
   - The key observation is that the game state can be analyzed based on the parity (even or odd) of the total number of coins.

2. **Winning Condition:**
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is even, Bob wins because he can always force the game into a state where the total number of coins becomes odd, which forces Alice to eventually lose.
   - If the total number of coins (`a + b`) is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the game into a state where the total number of coins becomes even, which forces Bob to eventually lose.

3. **Implementation:**
   - `func_1(a, b)` checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0` and returns the appropriate winner ('Bob' or 'Alice').
   - `func_2()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case using `func_1()`, printing the result for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided solution, the function correctly determines the winner for each test case based on the parity of the total number of coins. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
