Reasoning:
1. **Problem Description**: The problem involves determining the winner of a game between Alice and Bob based on the number of coins in their wallets. The game rules dictate that the player who cannot make a valid move loses. Both players play optimally.
2. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks whether the sum of the coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets is even. If the sum is even, it returns 'Bob'. Otherwise, it returns 'Alice'.
3. **Function `func_2`**: This function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets, calls `func_1(a, b)` to determine the winner, and collects these results in a list. Finally, it prints the results.

To verify correctness:
- The logic in `func_1` correctly determines the winner based on the parity of the sum of the coins. If the sum is even, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
- `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Given the problem description and the provided functions, the logic in both functions aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
