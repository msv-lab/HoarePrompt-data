You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

    5 1

Output

Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, where the coordinates are in strictly increasing order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1] <= 10^9), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct indices x and y such that 1 <= x, y <= n and x != y.

    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop. Specifically, for each index `i` from 0 to n-2, if the difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate is less than the difference between the current city coordinate and the backward city coordinate (if available), then `prog_cities[i]` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the forward and current city coordinates.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward city coordinate and the current city coordinate, based on the condition inside the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities on a number line in strictly increasing order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. It returns a new list `prog_cities` of length \( n-1 \). For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( n-2 \), the function sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city (if available); otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next and current cities.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities on a number line, where the cost of moving to the closest city is 1 coin, and the cost of moving directly to another city is the absolute difference in their positions.

2. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities `n`, the positions of the cities, and the number of queries `m`.
   - It then calculates the closest city for each city using the `func_1` function.
   - The `func_1` function incorrectly determines the closest city. It sets `back` to `-99999999` and `forward` to `99999999` at the start, which is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results.
   - It then checks if the forward city is closer than the backward city and assigns values accordingly.
   - The `pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b` lists are used to store prefix sums of the distances to the closest cities.
   - For each query, it uses these prefix sums to calculate the minimum cost to travel from one city to another.

3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - The `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. It should find the city that minimizes the absolute distance, but the current logic is flawed.
   - The prefix sums are calculated based on the incorrect closest city distances, leading to incorrect results for the queries.

Given these issues, the code does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
