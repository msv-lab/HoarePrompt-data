The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities on a number line in strictly increasing order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. It returns a new list `prog_cities` of length \( n-1 \). For each index \( i \) from 0 to \( n-2 \), the function sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if the distance to the next city is smaller than the distance to the previous city (if available); otherwise, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to the absolute difference between the coordinates of the next and current cities.
