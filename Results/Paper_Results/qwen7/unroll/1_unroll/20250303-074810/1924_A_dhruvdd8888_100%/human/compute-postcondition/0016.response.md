Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of constraints and conditions related to test cases, where for each test case, it checks if a given string `s` of length `m` (comprising the first `k` lowercase English alphabets) can be formed using exactly `n` distinct characters from these `k` alphabets. If the condition is met for any test case, the function prints 'YES'.**
