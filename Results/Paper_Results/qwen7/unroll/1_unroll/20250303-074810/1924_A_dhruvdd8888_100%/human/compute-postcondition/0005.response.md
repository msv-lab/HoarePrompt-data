Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, `s` is a string input by the user, `us` is a set containing the first `k` lowercase letters of the alphabet, `win` is an empty set, `ans` is an empty list, `ps` is 0.**

The code initializes `ps` to 0, which is a new variable that was not previously defined. All other variables retain their initial states.
