Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case consisting of three integers a, b, and m, where each integer is between 1 and 10^18, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it returns a value based on the relationship between a, b, and m.**
