Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
4. It calculates `mn` as `min(a, b) + m`, which is the minimum interval plus the visibility duration.
5. The program then checks if `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b` without either being `1`. If true, it prints `mn // a + mn // b + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `mn // a + mn // b`.

The logic in the program is sound. When `m` is divisible by both `a` and `b`, the additional `+1` accounts for the overlap of the last intervals, ensuring the maximum count is calculated correctly. When `m` is not divisible by both `a` and `b`, the calculation still provides the correct maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Given the problem constraints and the provided logic, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
