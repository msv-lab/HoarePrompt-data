You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of four non-negative integers p_i (0 ≤ p_i ≤ 200) representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is a series of integers representing the result of the loop for each test case. For each test case, the output is calculated as follows: 
    #1. Read a line of input and split it into four integers, which represent the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence.
    #2. For each integer in the first three positions (counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s), if it is odd, it contributes 1 to a counter; otherwise, it contributes 0. If all three of these counters sum to 3, then add 1 to another counter; otherwise, do nothing.
    #3. Add half of the sum of the four integers (integer division) to the previous counter.
    #4. Print the final value of the counter for each test case.
    #
    #In summary, the output state is a list of integers where each integer represents the computed value for each respective test case based on the rules described above.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on specific conditions and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, and if so, adds 1 to a counter. It also adds half of the total count of all numbers (integer division) to this counter. The final value of the counter for each test case is printed.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap
- Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero.
- Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is zero.
- Eve removes numbers to maximize Bob's wins.
- We need to find the maximum number of times Bob can win.

### Given Program Analysis
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split()))
        print((sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2)
```

#### Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Reading Input**: 
   - `int(input())` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `input().split()` splits the input string into a list of strings.
   - `map(lambda x: int(x) - int(x) % 2, input().split())` converts each string to an integer and then applies the lambda function to convert it to either 0 or 1 (essentially checking if the number is even or odd).

2. **Processing the List**:
   - `p[:3]` takes the first three elements of the list.
   - `list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))` checks if these elements are odd (returns True or False).
   - `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))` counts how many of the first three elements are odd.
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` checks if all three elements are odd.

3. **Final Calculation**:
   - `sum(p) // 2` calculates the sum of all elements in the list and divides by 2.
   - The final expression prints the result of the condition check plus the sum divided by 2.

### Correctness Analysis
- The logic of counting odd numbers in the first three elements and checking if they are all odd does not align with the problem requirements.
- The sum of the list divided by 2 does not reflect the number of times Bob can win.
- The program does not correctly implement the strategy to maximize Bob's wins.

### Example Verification
Let's verify with the provided examples:

1. **Input**: `1 1 1 0`
   - The list is `[1, 1, 1, 0]`.
   - First three elements: `[1, 1, 1]`.
   - All three are odd, so the condition `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3)` is true.
   - Sum of the list: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`, and `3 // 2 = 1`.
   - Output: `1 + 1 = 2`. (Incorrect, should be 1)

2. **Input**: `1 0 1 2`
   - The list is `[1, 0, 1, 2]`.
   - First three elements: `[1, 0, 1]`.
   - Two are odd, so the condition is false.
   - Sum of the list: `1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4`, and `4 // 2 = 2`.
   - Output: `0 + 2 = 2`. (Incorrect, should be 1)

Based on this analysis, the given program does not correctly solve the problem.
