Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the input but does not correctly handle the input values for `p_i` (number of ones, twos, threes, and fours). It subtracts the modulo 2 of each value from itself, which does not make sense in this context.

2. **Winning Condition Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the number of wins for Bob using the following logic:
   - `(sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3]))) == 3) + sum(p) // 2`
   - This logic is incorrect because it does not properly account for the bitwise XOR operation and the optimal strategy for removing numbers.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: To maximize Bob's wins, Eve should aim to reduce the sequence in such a way that the final XOR result is zero. The program does not implement this logic.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the parity (odd/even count) of the numbers and use the properties of the XOR operation. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones, twos, threes, fours = p[0], p[1], p[2], p[3]
        
        # Calculate the initial XOR of all numbers
        initial_xor = (ones & 1) ^ (twos & 1) ^ (threes & 1) ^ (fours & 1)
        
        # If the initial XOR is already 0, Bob wins immediately
        if initial_xor == 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            # Count the number of ones, since they have the highest priority
            num_ones = ones
            # Count the number of twos, threes, and fours combined
            num_others = twos + threes + fours
            
            # Bob can win if he can make the XOR zero by removing the right numbers
            # The maximum number of wins for Bob is the minimum of the number of ones and the total number of other numbers
            max_bob_wins = min(num_ones, num_others)
            print(max_bob_wins)

# Call the function
func()
```

This corrected program correctly handles the input and implements the logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the optimal strategy for removing numbers.
