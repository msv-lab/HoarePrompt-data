Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value based on specific conditions and prints the result. Specifically, it checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, and if so, adds 1 to a counter. It also adds half of the total count of all numbers (integer division) to this counter. The final value of the counter for each test case is printed.**
