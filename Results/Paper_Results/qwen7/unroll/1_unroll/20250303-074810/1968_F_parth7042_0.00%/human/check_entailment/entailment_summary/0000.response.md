Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
2. It initializes necessary variables and data structures to store prefix XOR values and their corresponding indices.
3. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from index `l-1` to `r-1` using the prefix XOR values.
4. If the XOR result is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results, indicating the subarray is interesting.
5. If the XOR result is non-zero, it checks if there exists a valid split point within the subarray that results in equal XOR values for each part. This is done by checking the positions stored in the dictionary `mp`.
6. The program handles invalid indices appropriately and appends an empty string after processing all queries for each test case.
7. Finally, it prints the results with 'YES' or 'NO' for each query followed by an empty line.

Given the execution summary and the detailed reasoning, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
