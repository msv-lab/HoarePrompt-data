Based on the initial state provided:

- `idx` is 2.
- `t` is an integer derived from `data[0]`. Since `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, `t` would be the integer value of the first element of `data`.
- `data` is a list of strings.
- `n` and `q` are integers derived from the input.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers.
- Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r` where `1 ≤ l < r ≤ n`.
- `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' for each query followed by an empty string.

The `print('\n'.join(results))` statement will join all elements of the `results` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Since `results` contains 'YES' or 'NO' for each query followed by an empty string, the output will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' values, each on a new line, ending with an empty line.

Output: **YES\nNO\nYES\nNO\n... (each 'YES' or 'NO' followed by a newline, ending with an empty line)**
