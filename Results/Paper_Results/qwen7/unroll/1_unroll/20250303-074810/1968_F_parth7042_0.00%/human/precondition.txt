t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5. The array a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}. Each query is defined by l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n. It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
