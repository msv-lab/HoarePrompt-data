Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, n and q are integers derived from the input, a is a list of n integers, and each query consists of two integers l and r where 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings, and assigns it to the variable `data`. The initial values of `t`, `a`, `n`, `q`, and the queries (l and r) remain unchanged. The variable `data` now holds the split input, which includes the values of `n` and `q` among others.
