Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer derived from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, n and q are integers derived from the input, a is a list of n integers, and each query consists of two integers l and r where 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n.**

Explanation: The variable `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `t`, `data`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and the queries remain unchanged as they were not affected by the executed code.
