Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: It iterates through each test case, extracting `n` and `q` for each case.
3. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) for the array `a`. This is done correctly by iterating through the array and computing the cumulative XOR.
4. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: It uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each prefix XOR value to its indices. This helps in quickly finding where a particular prefix XOR value occurs in the array.
5. **Query Processing**: For each query, it computes the XOR of the subarray by using the prefix XOR values (`pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]`). If this XOR is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting.
6. **Checking Valid Split**: If the XOR is non-zero, it checks if there exists a valid split by using binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices in the mapped list. This ensures that the subarray can be divided into parts with equal XOR values.
7. **Output Formatting**: Finally, it formats the results and prints them.

Given the problem description and the implementation details, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is interesting.

Correctness: **True**
