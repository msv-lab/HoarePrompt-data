Reasoning:
1. The program reads input and processes multiple test cases.
2. It correctly initializes variables and uses a prefix XOR array (`pf`) to store cumulative XOR values up to each index.
3. The program uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each unique prefix XOR value to its indices in the array.
4. For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray and checks if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values using the stored indices.
5. The logic for checking the possibility of dividing the subarray into parts with equal XOR values seems correct, using binary search (`bisect.bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices.
6. The program handles the output correctly by appending 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list and printing them at the end.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and correctly implements the solution.

Correctness: **True**
