Output State: **`idx` is 2, `t` is an integer derived from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input, n and q are integers derived from the input, a is a list of n integers, and each query consists of two integers l and r where 1 â‰¤ l < r â‰¤ n; `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
