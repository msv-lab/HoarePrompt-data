#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes user input based on the number of test cases and the length of the array specified. It reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts these elements to integers, and returns them as a list. This list corresponds to the integers entered by the user for the given test cases and array length.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a list of integers from user input, sorts the list, and returns it. The input list corresponds to the array 'a' with length 'n'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is an integer representing the length of the array a, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

    #The program returns a map object containing strings of the input values split from the input.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes input data for multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads an integer `n` indicating the length of an array, followed by `n` integers. It returns a map object containing strings of these input values split from the input.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters, which means it does not use any variables passed to it. Instead, it reads input from the user in the form of a string and returns a list of characters. However, based on the problem description, the function should not be part of the solution for the described problem. The actual implementation for solving the problem is missing.
def func_6():
    return list(input())
    #The program returns a list of characters entered by the user.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a string input from the user and returns a list containing each character of the input string as a separate element.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function does not take any parameters. The input is provided through standard input and consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t indicating the number of test cases. Following t lines, each line describes a test case with an integer n representing the length of the array a, followed by n integers representing the elements of the array a.

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers; `ans` is a list where each element is the cumulative product of all elements in `arr` up to that index; `tem` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: After the loop executes all the iterations, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`. The variable `tem` starts at 1 and gets multiplied by each element in `arr` during each iteration, and the result is appended to `ans`. Therefore, `ans` will have a length equal to the length of `arr`, and each element in `ans` will be the product of all elements in `arr` up to that index.
    return ans
    #`ans` is a list where each element is the cumulative product of all elements in `arr` up to that index, and `tem` is 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` of positive integers and returns a new list `ans` where each element is the cumulative product of all elements in `arr` up to that index. Initially, `tem` is set to 1, but its final value is 1 and not included in the returned list `ans`.

    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of `arr` from the end to the start; `tem` is 1.
    #
    #To explain further, after the loop executes, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The variable `tem` is initialized to 1 and is used to keep track of the cumulative product during each iteration of the loop.

This list `ans` contains the cumulative product of the elements in `arr`, starting from the last element and moving towards the first, with the initial value of the cumulative product set to 1.
