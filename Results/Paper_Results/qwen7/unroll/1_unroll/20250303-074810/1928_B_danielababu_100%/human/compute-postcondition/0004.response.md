Output State: `arr` is a list of positive integers; `ans` is a list containing the cumulative product of `arr` from the end to the start; `tem` is 1.

To explain further, after the loop executes, `ans` will contain the cumulative product of the elements in `arr` starting from the last element and moving towards the first. The variable `tem` is initialized to 1 and is used to keep track of the cumulative product during each iteration of the loop.
