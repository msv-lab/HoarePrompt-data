Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head involves the variables `(n, k)` which are unpacked from the tuples in the `cases` list.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `cases` list. Each element in the `cases` list is a tuple containing two integers `n` and `k`.

3. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the `cases` list having at least one tuple, we need to ensure that the `cases` list is not empty. Additionally, since the loop iterates over each tuple in the `cases` list, the first tuple should be accessible for the first iteration.

4. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state given is:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
   - `cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers \(n\) and \(k\) such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^6\) and \(1 \leq k \leq n\)
   - `results` is an empty list
   - `sequence` is a list containing the first 25 powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\)

Since the loop depends on the `cases` list, we need to ensure that the `cases` list is non-empty for the loop to execute. We don't need to adjust the values of `t`, `results`, or `sequence` because they are not part of the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `cases` list to ensure it is not empty.

**State:**
- `cases` is a list of tuples that must not be empty
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\)
- `results` is an empty list
- `sequence` is a list containing the first 25 powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\)

So, the final state is:
**State: **`cases` is a list of tuples that must not be empty, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `results` is an empty list, `sequence` is a list containing the first 25 powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\)**
