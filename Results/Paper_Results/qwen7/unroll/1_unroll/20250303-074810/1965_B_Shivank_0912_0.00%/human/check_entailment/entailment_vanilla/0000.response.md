Let's break down the problem and the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires constructing a sequence `a` of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
1. No subsequence of `a` sums to `k`.
2. For all `1 ≤ v ≤ n` where `v ≠ k`, there is a subsequence of `a` that sums to `v`.

### Provided Code Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into tokens.
   - It processes the input to create a list of test cases, each consisting of `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function generates a fixed sequence of length 25 where each element is a power of 2 (`2 ** i` for `i` in range 25).
   - For each test case, it appends a tuple `(25, sequence)` to the results list.

3. **Main Execution:**
   - The results are printed for each test case, showing the length of the sequence and the sequence itself.

### Verification of Correctness
1. **Sequence Construction:**
   - The generated sequence `[2 ** i for i in range(25)]` is `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608, 16777216]`.
   - This sequence ensures that any subsequence sum will be unique because each element is a distinct power of 2.

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - Since the sequence only contains powers of 2, no subsequence can sum to an odd number `k` unless `k` is one of these powers of 2. Given `1 ≤ k ≤ n` and `n ≤ 10^6`, `k` will never be a power of 2 within this range.

3. **Subsequence Sums for All `v ≠ k`:**
   - For any `v` that is not `k`, the sequence can be constructed using combinations of these powers of 2 to form any sum from 1 to `n` except `k`.

### Conclusion
The provided code correctly constructs a sequence that meets the problem requirements. The sequence of powers of 2 ensures that no subsequence sums to `k` while allowing any other sum from 1 to `n` to be formed.

**Correctness:** True
