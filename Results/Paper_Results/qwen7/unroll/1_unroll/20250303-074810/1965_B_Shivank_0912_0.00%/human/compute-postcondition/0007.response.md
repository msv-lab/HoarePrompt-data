Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `cases`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers `n` and `k` with specific constraints. The function returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains (25, [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768, 65536, 131072, 262144, 524288, 1048576, 2097152, 4194304, 8388608]), representing the first 25 powers of 2 starting from 2^0.**
