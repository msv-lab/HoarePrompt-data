Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, for a grid of size \( n \times n \), there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. The program prints `2 * n` in this case, but the correct answer should be `2 * n - 2` because we only need to color cells on the two main diagonals, which together have \( 2n - 2 \) cells (excluding the overlapping cell).

For example, consider the test case `n = 3` and `k = 10`. The correct answer should be `4` (coloring the cells on both main diagonals excluding the overlapping cell), but the program outputs `6`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k <= 4 * n - 4:
            print(math.ceil(k / 2))
        elif k == 4 * n - 3:
            print(2 * n - 1)
        elif k == 4 * n - 2:
            print(2 * n - 2)
        else:
            print(2 * n)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles the special case when `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2` correctly.
