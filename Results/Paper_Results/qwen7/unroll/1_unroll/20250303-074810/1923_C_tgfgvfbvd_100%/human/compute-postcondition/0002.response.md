Output State: The output state consists of "YES" or "NO" printed for each query in the range specified by `m` queries. For each query `(a, b)`, it checks if the number of 1s in the subarray `l[a-1...b]` is more than half the length of the subarray. If true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
