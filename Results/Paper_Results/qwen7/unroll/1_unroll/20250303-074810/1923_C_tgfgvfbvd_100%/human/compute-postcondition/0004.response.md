Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on a given list `c`. It reads the list `c` and a number of queries from standard input. For each query defined by a pair of indices `(a, b)`, it calculates the count of the integer `1` within the subarray `c[a-1...b]` and compares it to half the length of the subarray. If the count of `1`s is greater than half the length of the subarray, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function does not return any value but prints the result for each query.**
