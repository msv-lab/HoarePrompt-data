State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, _ is 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used as a placeholder and does not hold any specific value before the loop starts. It is incremented within the loop itself.
- The variable `t` is defined as an input from the user and is specified to be a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
- For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer within the given range. The loop counter `_` starts at 0 and will increment with each iteration.

Thus, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is ensuring that `t` is a positive integer within the specified range. The loop counter `_` starts at 0 and will be incremented during the loop iterations.
