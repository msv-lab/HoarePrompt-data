Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` which is being iterated from `3` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 3`, the initial value of `i` should be set to `3`.

3. **Determine the final condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i <= n + 1`. Therefore, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1` for the loop to continue executing.

4. **Consider other relevant variables**: The variables `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `t`, `n`, and `k` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect whether the loop will execute. However, they might be used within the loop body, but since we are only adjusting the states for the loop to execute, we don't need to change them unless explicitly required by the loop logic, which is not given here.

Based on the above analysis, the only variables that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**
