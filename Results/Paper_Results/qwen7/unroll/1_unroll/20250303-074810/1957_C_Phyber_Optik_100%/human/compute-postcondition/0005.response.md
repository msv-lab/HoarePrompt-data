Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for each test case involving n and k, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Additionally, the function considers valid moves (r_i, c_i) for i-th move, where 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n, and no two rooks attack each other.**

This means the function `func_1` takes an integer `n` within a specific range and processes it along with related parameters `k`, `r_i`, and `c_i` under given constraints, returning a value based on these inputs and conditions.
