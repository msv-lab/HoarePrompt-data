### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key components and logic of the program. Let's break down the analysis to confirm the correctness:

1. **Import Statements and Recursion Limit Setting**:
   - Setting the recursion limit to 400,000 is necessary due to the potential large values of `n`.
   - Initializing the `dp` list with -1 values and calling `func_1` ensures that the dynamic programming table is precomputed.

2. **Reading Input**:
   - Reading the number of test cases `t` and the dimensions of the chessboard `n` and the number of moves already played `k` is straightforward and correct.

3. **Tracking Invalid Positions**:
   - Using a set `invalid` to track the positions that are already occupied by rooks is correct. This helps in determining the number of valid positions left.

4. **Dynamic Programming Calculation**:
   - The dynamic programming table `dp` is correctly initialized with base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`.
   - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is derived from combinatorial logic and is correct for calculating the number of ways to place non-attacking rooks.

5. **Output Calculation**:
   - The calculation of the number of valid configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]` is correct. This accounts for the fact that even if all positions are invalid, there is still one valid configuration (no rooks placed).

### Verification:

- **Base Cases**:
  - The base cases `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3` are correctly defined.
  - The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is correct and matches the combinatorial logic for placing non-attacking rooks.

- **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**:
  - The `dp` table is initialized to -1, and the function `func_1` populates it using the given recurrence relation. This ensures that the table is precomputed and ready for use.

- **Input Handling**:
  - The program correctly handles the input and tracks invalid positions.

- **Output Calculation**:
  - The calculation of the number of valid configurations using `dp[n - len(invalid)]` is correct.

Given that the program follows the correct logic and uses appropriate data structures and calculations, the program is correct.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
