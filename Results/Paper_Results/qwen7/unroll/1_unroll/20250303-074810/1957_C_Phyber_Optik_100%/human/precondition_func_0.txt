t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The pairs (r_i, c_i) for i-th move you made are such that 1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n and the moves are valid (no two rooks attack each other). The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.
