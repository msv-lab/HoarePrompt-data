The function accepts an integer `n` such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5. It computes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` for 1 ≤ i ≤ n contains the value `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` for each respective `i`. After the function concludes, `dp` is returned, representing the computed values under the specified conditions.
