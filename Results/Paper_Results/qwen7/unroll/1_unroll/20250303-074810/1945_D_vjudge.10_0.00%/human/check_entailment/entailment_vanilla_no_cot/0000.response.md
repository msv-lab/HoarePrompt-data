To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze it step-by-step against the problem description.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - It stores the values of `a_values` and `b_values` correctly from the input strings split into lists of integers.

3. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the cost to move Kirill to a position within the first `max_p` people.
   - It starts from the last person (`num_fila - 1`) and moves backward to `max_p - 1`.
   - It checks whether moving to the current position is cheaper using `a_values` or `b_values`.
   - This part seems to handle the logic of choosing the minimum cost path to move Kirill to a position within the allowed range.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where Kirill might need to move to the very first position by adding `a_values[0]` when `y == 1`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program collects the total cost for each test case and prints it out.

### Potential Issues:
- **Logic for Cost Calculation:**
  - The logic for calculating the minimum cost seems to be implemented correctly, but there might be a small issue in the loop where it checks the cost. Specifically, the inner loop should ensure that the cost is minimized by checking both `a_values` and `b_values` correctly.
  - The program should ensure that the cost is updated only when it is strictly less than the current cost.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the code, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` people. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
**Correctness: True**
