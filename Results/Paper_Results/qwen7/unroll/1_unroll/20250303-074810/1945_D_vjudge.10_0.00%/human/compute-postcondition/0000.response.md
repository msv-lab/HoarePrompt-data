Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are lists of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5; `x` is an input integer.**

The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `x`. The initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` remain unchanged.
