Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through its constraints, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, list a of length n, and list b of length n. For each test case, if n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a_i, b_i are positive integers within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the constraints provided, processes each test case according to the specified rules, and returns a result for each test case.
