Reasoning:
1. The provided code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
2. It initializes variables to store the cumulative cost (`custo`), the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`), and the maximum allowable final position (`max_p`).
3. It correctly reads and stores the values of `a` and `b` for each test case.
4. The logic for calculating the cumulative cost is implemented as follows:
   - It iterates from the last person to `max_p - 1` and adds the appropriate cost based on whether `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` is smaller.
   - It then iterates from `max_p - 1` down to 1, adjusting the cumulative cost based on the conditions provided.
5. The calculated cumulative cost for each test case is stored in the `custos` list.
6. Finally, it prints the cumulative cost for each test case.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correctly implemented to calculate the minimum number of coins Kirill needs to spend to ensure he is among the first `m` people in the queue.

Correctness: **True**
