### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and function summary.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `custos` (a list to store the results for each test case).
   - It initializes `custo` (total cost) to 0.
   - It initializes `num_fila` (number of people in the queue) to the value read from the input.
   - It initializes `max_p` (maximum allowable final position) to the value read from the input.
   - It initializes empty lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.

3. **Reading Input Values**:
   - It reads the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue and appends them to the respective lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions.
   - It starts from the last person in the queue (`num_fila - 1`) and moves backward to the `max_p - 1` position.
   - For each position `y`, it checks whether moving to the next position would cost less than staying at the current position. If so, it adds the appropriate cost to `custo`.
   - It handles edge cases where `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.

5. **Output**:
   - After calculating the total cost for each test case, it appends the result to `custos`.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness Check

- **Logic**: The logic in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions. It considers both `a_i` and `b_i` costs appropriately.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.
- **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input values and processes them as required.
- **Output**: The program correctly stores and prints the results for each test case.

However, there is a subtle issue in the cost calculation logic. Specifically, the program does not handle the transition from one position to another correctly. The logic for choosing between `a_values[y]` and `b_values[y]` might not always lead to the optimal solution. 

For example, consider the following test case:
```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The program calculates the cost as follows:
- For `y = 3`: `a_values[3] = 9`, `b_values[3] = 5`. Since `a_values[3] > b_values[3]`, it adds `9` to `custo`.
- For `y = 2`: `a_values[2] = 6`, `b_values[2] = 3`. Since `a_values[2] > b_values[2]`, it adds `6` to `custo`.
- For `y = 1`: `a_values[1] = 3`, `b_values[1] = 4`. Since `a_values[1] < b_values[1]`, it adds `3` to `custo`.

The total cost is `9 + 6 + 3 = 18`. However, the optimal solution should be:
- For `y = 3`: `a_values[3] = 9`, `b_values[3] = 5`. Since `a_values[3] > b_values[3]`, it adds `5` to `custo`.
- For `y = 2`: `a_values[2] = 6`, `b_values[2] = 3`. Since `a_values[2] > b_values[2]`, it adds `3` to `custo`.
- For `y = 1`: `a_values[1] = 3`, `b_values[1] = 4`. Since `a_values[1] < b_values[1]`, it adds `3` to `custo`.

The total cost is `5 + 3 + 3 = 11`.

Therefore, the program does not always find the minimum cost, which means it is not fully correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
