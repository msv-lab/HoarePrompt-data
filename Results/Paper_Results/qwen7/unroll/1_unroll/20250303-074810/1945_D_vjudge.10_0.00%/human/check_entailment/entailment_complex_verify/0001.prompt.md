You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The guys lined up in a queue of n people, starting with person number i = 1 ,
to ask Serafim the Owl about the meaning of life. Unfortunately, Kirill was
very busy writing the legend for this problem, so he arrived a little later
and stood at the end of the line after the n -th person. Kirill is completely
dissatisfied with this situation, so he decided to bribe some people ahead of
him.

For the i -th person in the queue, Kirill knows two values: a_i and b_i . If
at the moment Kirill is standing at position i , then he can choose any
position j such that j < i and exchange places with the person at position j .
In this case, Kirill will have to pay him a_j coins. And for each k such that
j < k < i , Kirill will have to pay b_k coins to the person at position k .
Kirill can perform this action any number of times.

Kirill is thrifty, so he wants to spend as few coins as possible, but he
doesn't want to wait too long, so Kirill believes he should be among the first
m people in line.

Help Kirill determine the minimum number of coins he will have to spend in
order to not wait too long.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows
the description of the test case.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le m \le n
\le 200\,000 ) — the number of people in the queue besides Kirill and the
maximum allowable final position of Kirill, respectively.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n separated by spaces
(1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n separated by spaces (1
\le b_i \le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of coins
Kirill needs to spend.

    #State: Output State: `custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost calculated for each test case after executing the loop. Each element in the list represents the final value of `custo` for that specific test case, based on the given inputs `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values`.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The output state will be a list containing the same values as the initial state, because the loop does not modify the `custos` list. The `print(c)` statement simply outputs each element of the `custos` list without changing its contents.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( m \), and two lists \( a \) and \( b \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates a cumulative cost based on certain conditions involving elements of \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, it iterates through the lists and sums up values according to predefined rules. After processing all test cases, it prints the cumulative cost for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue `num_fila` and the maximum allowable final position `max_p`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - It initializes `custo` (total cost) to 0.
   - It initializes `max_p` (maximum allowable final position) to the value read from the input.
   - It initializes empty lists `a_values` and `b_values` to store the costs `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue.

3. **Reading Input Values**:
   - It reads the values of `a_i` and `b_i` for each person in the queue and appends them to the respective lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions.
   - It starts from the last person in the queue (`num_fila - 1`) and moves backward to the `max_p - 1` position.
   - For each position `y`, it checks whether moving to the next position would cost less than staying at the current position. If so, it adds the appropriate cost to `custo`.
   - It handles edge cases where `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.

5. **Output**:
   - After calculating the total cost for each test case, it prints the result.

### Correctness Check

- **Logic**: The logic in the program seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost for Kirill to move to a position within the first `max_p` positions. It considers both `a_i` and `b_i` costs appropriately.
- **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when `y` is 1 or when it reaches the start of the queue.
- **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input values and processes them as required.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic and handling of the input and output are correct according to the problem statement.
