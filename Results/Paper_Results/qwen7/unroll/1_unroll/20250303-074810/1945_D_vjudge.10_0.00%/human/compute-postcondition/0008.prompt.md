You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000; a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n are lists of positive integers where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9; the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5.
def func():
    x = int(input())
    custos = []
    for i in range(x):
        custo = 0
        
        num_fila = 0
        
        max_p = 0
        
        a_values = []
        
        b_values = []

            a_values.append(int(y))
        
        for y in b:
            b_values.append(int(y))

            if a_values[y] < b_values[y]:
                custo += a_values[y]
            else:
                custo += b_values[y]
        
        for y in range(max_p - 1, 0, -1):
            if a_values[y - 1] + b_values[y] <= a_values[y]:
                custo += b_values[y]
                if y == 1:
                    custo += a_values[0]
                    break
            else:
                custo += a_values[y]
                break
        
        custos.append(custo)
        
    #State: Output State: `custos` is a list containing the cumulative cost calculated for each test case after executing the loop. Each element in the list represents the final value of `custo` for that specific test case, based on the given inputs `num_fila`, `max_p`, `a_values`, and `b_values`.
    for c in custos:
        print(c)
        
    #State: The output state will be a list containing the same values as the initial state, because the loop does not modify the `custos` list. The `print(c)` statement simply outputs each element of the `custos` list without changing its contents.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through its constraints, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, list a of length n, and list b of length n. For each test case, if n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 200,000, and a_i, b_i are positive integers within the range 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9, the function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
