Reasoning:
- The function `func_1()` correctly handles the conversion of times from 24-hour format to 12-hour format.
- It properly converts '00' to '12'.
- It correctly adjusts hours from '13' to '23' by subtracting 12 and adding a leading zero when necessary.
- The AM/PM indicator is set correctly based on whether the hour is greater than or equal to 12.
- The function processes each test case as expected and prints the results directly without any issues.
- Given the problem constraints and the example provided, the function appears to handle all valid inputs correctly.

Correctness: **True**
