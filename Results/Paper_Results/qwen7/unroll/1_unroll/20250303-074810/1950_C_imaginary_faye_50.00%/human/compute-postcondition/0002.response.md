Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing a transformed time string based on the input time string. For each input time "hh:mm", the code converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and outputs it. If the input hour is '00', it is converted to '12'. Hours from '01' to '12' remain the same. Hours from '13' to '23' are converted by subtracting 12 and prefixing with '0'. The AM/PM indicator is determined by whether the hour is greater than or equal to '12'. Each line will also include either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the converted hour.
