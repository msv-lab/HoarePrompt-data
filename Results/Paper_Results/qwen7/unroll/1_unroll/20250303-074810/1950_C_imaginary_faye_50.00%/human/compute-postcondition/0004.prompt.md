You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440, and for each test case, s is a string of length 5 in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time in the 24-hour format where hh is the hour from 00 to 23 and mm is the minute from 00 to 59.
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        
        h = s[:2]
        
        if h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each line containing a transformed time string based on the input time string. For each input time "hh:mm", the code converts it to a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation and outputs it. If the input hour is '00', it is converted to '12'. Hours from '01' to '12' remain the same. Hours from '13' to '23' are converted by subtracting 12 and prefixing with '0'. The AM/PM indicator is determined by whether the hour is greater than or equal to '12'. Each line will also include either 'AM' or 'PM' based on the converted hour.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It returns "valid" if the time represented by `s` corresponds to the integer `t` in minutes since midnight, otherwise it returns "invalid".

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
