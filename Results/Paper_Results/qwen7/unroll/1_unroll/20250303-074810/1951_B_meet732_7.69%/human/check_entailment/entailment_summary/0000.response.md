Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the positions of other cows with higher ratings than the specified cow `k`. However, the logic within the `func_1` function does not correctly determine the maximum number of wins for cow `k`. Here are the issues:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Indices**: The function only checks up to the first two indices where a cow has a higher rating than `k`. This is insufficient because we need to consider all potential opponents until `k` cannot win anymore.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The function does not handle edge cases where `k` is at the beginning or end of the list correctly. For example, if `k` is at position 0 and there are no cows with higher ratings before it, the function should return `k-1`.

3. **Logic for Calculating Maximum Wins**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of wins is flawed. The function should consider the entire sequence of matches and determine the longest sequence where `k` can win.

Given these issues, the provided implementation does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
