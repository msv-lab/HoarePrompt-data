Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct integers. It returns a value based on several conditions involving the list `a`, an integer `k`, and a list `ind`.**

- If the function returns `n - 1`, where `n` is the length of the list `a`.
- If the function returns `k - 1`, where `k` is the index stored in `ind[0]`.
- If the function returns `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index in the list `a` where an element is greater than the 14th element of `a`, and `ind[0]` is greater than `k`.
- If the function returns the maximum value between `k - ind[0]` and `ind[0] - 1`, where `ind[0]` is the index of the element in list `a` that is greater than the 14th element of `a`, and `k` is a given value.
- If the function returns the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` minus 1 and `k` minus 1, given that `ind` contains indices of elements in `a` greater than the 14th element of `a`, and `ind`'s first element is 0.
- If the function returns the maximum value between the first index in `ind` minus 1 and the difference between the second index in `ind` and the first index in `ind`.
- If the function returns the maximum value between `(ind[0] - 1)` and `(k - ind[0])`.
