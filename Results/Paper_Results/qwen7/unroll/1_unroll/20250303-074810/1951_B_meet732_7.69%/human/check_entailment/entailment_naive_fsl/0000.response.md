Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not handle all potential cases correctly. Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the following input:
```
3
5 3
5 1 4 3 2
```

Expected output:
```
2
```

However, the program outputs:
```
1
```

Let's analyze why this happens:
- The cow with index 3 has a rating of 4.
- The cow with index 2 has a rating of 1, which is less than 4, so the cow with index 3 wins the first match.
- The cow with index 3 now faces the cow with index 4, which has a rating of 3. Since 4 > 3, the cow with index 3 wins the second match.
- Therefore, the cow with index 3 should win 2 matches.

However, the program only considers the first cow with a higher rating and stops after finding one such cow. This leads to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all cows with higher ratings and determine the optimal swap position to maximize the number of wins.
