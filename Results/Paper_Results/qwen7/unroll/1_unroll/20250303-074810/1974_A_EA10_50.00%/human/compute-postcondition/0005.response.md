Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two non-negative integers \(x\) and \(y\) (both between 0 and 99), and a positive integer \(t\) (between 1 and \(10^4\)). For each test case, it calculates a value \(z\) based on \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\), and updates \(z\) if necessary according to specific conditions. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \(z\) for each case.**
