Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case consists of two non-negative integers x and y, both within the range of 0 to 99, and a positive integer t within the range of 1 to 10^4. For each test case, it returns a result based on the values of x, y, and t.**

Given the constraints, the function seems to process a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer `t` and two non-negative integers `x` and `y`. However, since the specific logic for processing these values is not provided, the described functionality focuses on the nature of the input and the implied processing without detailing the exact operations.
