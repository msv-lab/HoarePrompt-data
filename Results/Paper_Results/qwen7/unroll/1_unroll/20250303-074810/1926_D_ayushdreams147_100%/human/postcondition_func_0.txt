The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It processes the list `a` to count the number of unique elements and returns this count. After execution, the function modifies the internal state by using a dictionary `count` to keep track of occurrences of transformed values of elements in `a`, but ensures this dictionary is empty by the end of the function.
