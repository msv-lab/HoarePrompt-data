Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - It reads the number of piles `n` and the sizes of the piles into an array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` as input.
   - It checks if the smallest pile has more than one stone. If `arr[0] != 1`, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
   - It then converts the array to a set and sorts it to get unique pile sizes in ascending order.
   - It iterates through the sorted unique pile sizes to check if they form a consecutive sequence.
     - If any gap greater than 1 is found between two consecutive elements, it sets `not_c` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
     - It alternates the boolean value `A` for each element in the sorted unique pile sizes.
   - Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is `True`, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Check:**
   - The initial check `if arr[0] != 1:` is correct because if the smallest pile has more than one stone, Alice can always remove one stone from each pile, making the smallest pile size 1, and then Bob will be forced to make a move that eventually leads to Alice winning.

2. **Consecutive Sequence Check:**
   - The logic for checking if the pile sizes form a consecutive sequence is flawed. The current implementation only checks for gaps but does not correctly simulate the game state.
   - For example, consider the input `[1, 3, 5]`. The function will return 'Alice' because there is no gap greater than 1, but this is not necessarily true in the game context. In the game, Alice can remove 1 stone from each pile, making the sequence `[0, 2, 4]`, and then Bob will have to make a move that could lead to a different outcome.

3. **Game Strategy:**
   - The game is a classic example of the Nim game variant where the XOR of the pile sizes determines the winner if both players play optimally.
   - The correct approach would be to compute the XOR of all pile sizes and determine the winner based on whether the result is zero or not.
   - If the XOR is zero, the second player (Bob) wins; otherwise, the first player (Alice) wins.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the game logic. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
