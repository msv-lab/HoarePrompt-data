Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Input Handling**: The program reads the number of piles `n` along with the array of stones in each pile in one go using `list(map(int, input().rstrip().split()))`. This combines `n` and the array into a single list, which is incorrect. The number of piles `n` should be read separately, followed by reading the array of stones.

2. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1` is called incorrectly. It should take the number of piles `n` and the array `arr` as arguments, but the current implementation only takes the array `arr`.

3. **Logic Error in `func_1`**:
   - The logic to determine the winner is flawed. The current implementation checks if the smallest pile is not 1 and returns "Alice" immediately, which is not always correct.
   - The logic involving the set of unique values and checking differences is also incorrect and unnecessary for this problem.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    arr = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    
    # Determine the winner based on the XOR of the array elements
    xor_result = 0
    for value in arr:
        xor_result ^= value
    
    if xor_result == 0:
        print("Bob")
    else:
        print("Alice")
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program:
- **Reading Input**: The number of piles `n` and the array of stones are read correctly.
- **XOR Logic**: The winner is determined by calculating the XOR of all the elements in the array. If the result is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
- **Efficiency**: This approach is efficient and works within the constraints provided.
