Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, 0, max_index, i)` returned '<'; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` if `min_indices` is not an empty list, otherwise `min_index` remains 0.**

This means that `min_index` is now set to the first element of the list `min_indices`. If `min_indices` was initially an empty list, then `min_index` remains 0. Otherwise, `min_index` is set to the smallest index in `min_indices`.
