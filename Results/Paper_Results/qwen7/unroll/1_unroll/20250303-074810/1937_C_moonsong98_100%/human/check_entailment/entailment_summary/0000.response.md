### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the given code step-by-step to determine if the program is correct.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
- We can ask up to \(3n\) queries of the form \((p_a \mid p_b)\) vs \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
- The goal is to find the pair \((i, j)\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is the maximum possible value.

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function asks a query and returns the result of the comparison.
   - It correctly handles the input and output as specified.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function prints the result and flushes the output buffer.
   - It correctly handles the input and output as specified.

3. **Function `func_3`**:
   - This function aims to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic:
     - For \(n = 2\), it directly outputs the indices \((0, 1)\).
     - For \(n > 2\):
       - It initializes `max_index` to 0.
       - It iterates through the array to find the first index where the result of the query is `<`.
       - It collects all such indices in `min_indices`.
       - It then iterates through these indices to find the minimum index that is not equal to `max_index`.
       - Finally, it outputs the pair \((max_index, min_index)\).

#### Correctness Check:
- **Initialization and Base Case**:
  - The base case for \(n = 2\) is handled correctly by directly outputting the indices \((0, 1)\).

- **Finding `max_index`**:
  - The loop to find the first index where the result of the query is `<` is correct. This ensures that we have at least one index where the bitwise OR operation results in a smaller value compared to another pair.

- **Collecting `min_indices`**:
  - Collecting all indices where the result is `<` is correct. However, this step alone does not guarantee finding the optimal pair.

- **Finding `min_index`**:
  - The logic to find the minimum index from `min_indices` that is not equal to `max_index` is flawed. This approach does not necessarily lead to the pair with the maximum XOR value. Instead, it might just find the smallest index among those that satisfy the condition, which is not always the optimal solution.

- **Output**:
  - The final output of the pair \((max_index, min_index)\) is not guaranteed to be the pair with the maximum XOR value.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation does not guarantee finding the pair with the maximum XOR value. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
