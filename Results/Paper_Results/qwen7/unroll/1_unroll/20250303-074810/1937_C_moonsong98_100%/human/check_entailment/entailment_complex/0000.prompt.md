Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

# Annotated Functions:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.readline
sys.setrecursionlimit(int(1000000000.0))
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n.
def func_1(a, b, c, d):
    print(f'? {a} {b} {c} {d}')
    #This is printed: ? [a] [b] [c] [d]
    sys.stdout.flush()
    return input().strip()
    #The program returns a string input by the user after stripping any leading and trailing whitespace.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four integer parameters a, b, c, and d (with the constraint 0 <= a, b, c, d < n), prints their values, and then waits for user input. Upon receiving input, it returns the input as a string with any leading or trailing whitespace removed.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n.
def func_2(a, b):
    print(f'! {a} {b}')
    #This is printed: ! [a] [b]
    sys.stdout.flush()
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, both within the range of 0 to n-1. It prints the values of `a` and `b` in a formatted string and flushes the output buffer. The function does not return any value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4.
def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    if (n == 2) :
        func_2(0, 1)
        return
        #The program does not return any value since there is no return statement in the given code snippet.

            max_index = i
        
    #State: Output State: `max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, max_index, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists.
    min_indices = [max_index]
    for i in range(0, n):
        res = func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)
        
        if res == '<':
            min_indices = [i]
        elif res == '=':
            min_indices.append(i)
        
    #State: Output State: `max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, 0, max_index, i)` returned '<'. If no such character exists, `min_indices` remains an empty list.
    min_index = min_indices[0]
    for i in min_indices:
        if i == max_index:
            continue
        
        res = func_1(min_index, min_index, min_index, i)
        
        if res == '=':
            min_index = i
        
    #State: max_index is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, 0, max_index, i)` returned '<' and for which `i` is not equal to `max_index`; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` if `min_indices` is not an empty list, otherwise `min_index` remains 0.
    func_2(max_index, min_index)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) to find specific indices based on the outcome of calls to `func_1`. It first identifies the index of the first occurrence of a specific character ('<') in a sequence using `func_1` and stores it in `max_index`. Then, it collects all indices where `func_1` returns '<' and stores them in `min_indices`. After that, it updates `min_indices` to only include indices that are not equal to `max_index`. Finally, it finds the minimum index from the updated `min_indices` and calls `func_2` with `max_index` and `min_index` as arguments. The function does not return any value.
