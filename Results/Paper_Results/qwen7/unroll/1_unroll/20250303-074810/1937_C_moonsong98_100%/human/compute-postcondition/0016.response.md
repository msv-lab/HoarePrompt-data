Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character '<' found in the sequence from index 0 to n-1 when calling `func_1(0, 0, 0, i)`, or remains 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing all indices `i` for which `func_1(max_index, 0, max_index, i)` returned '<' and for which `i` is not equal to `max_index`; `min_index` is the first element of `min_indices` if `min_indices` is not an empty list, otherwise `min_index` remains 0; `func_2(max_index, min_index)` has been called.**

Explanation: The function `func_2(max_index, min_index)` is called with the current values of `max_index` and `min_index`. No new variables are defined or modified within this function call, so the values of `max_index` and `min_index` remain unchanged. The list `min_indices` and its first element `min_index` also remain unchanged.
