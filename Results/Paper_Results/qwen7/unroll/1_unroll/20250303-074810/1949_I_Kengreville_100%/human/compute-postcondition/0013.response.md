Output State: `bipartite` is True or False based on the `dfs` function, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to True, `coef` is a list of length `n` where some elements are set to 1 and others are still None, `tot` is an integer that could be 0 or non-zero, `ok` is True if there exists at least one component that is bipartite and has a non-zero `tot`, otherwise False.
