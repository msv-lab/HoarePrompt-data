Output State: **`n` is an input integer, x, y, and r are lists of length `n`, visited is a list of boolean values of length `n` initialized to False, and coef is a list of length `n` initialized to None.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The lengths and initializations of the lists `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, and `coef` remain unchanged from their initial state.
