Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer entered by the user, `visited` is a list of length `n` with all elements set to False, `coef` is a list of length `n` initialized to None, `tot` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
