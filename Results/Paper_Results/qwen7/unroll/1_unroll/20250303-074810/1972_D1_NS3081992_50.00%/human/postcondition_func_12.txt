The function `func_13` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers with `b` not being zero. It returns three values: `x`, `y`, and `g`. If `b` is zero, it returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` as a positive integer. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with `b` and `a % b`, and returns the results adjusted according to the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD).
