Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - Reads the dimensions of the grid and initializes necessary variables like `grid`, `elements`, `allPlayers`, `goal`, and `points`.
   - Iterates through each command up to `t` times, updating the positions of players and handling different actions (moving, catching, throwing, etc.).
   - Checks for specific conditions such as scoring, eliminating players, and catching the golden snitch.
   - Prints the appropriate events during the game and the final scores after all commands are processed.

2. **Function `goalIn(pos)`**:
   - Determines whether a given position `pos` corresponds to a goal of either the red or blue team.
   - Returns 0 if `pos` is a red goal, 1 if `pos` is a blue goal, and -1 otherwise.
   - This function is used within `func_1()` to check if a player has scored a goal.

3. **Function `isPlayer(el)`**:
   - Determines whether a given entity `el` is a player.
   - Returns `True` if the entity is a player (starts with 'R' or 'B' and is not a goal).
   - This function is used within `func_1()` to validate if an entity is a player before performing actions like moving or catching.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to simulate the game, handle player movements, and determine scoring events. The functions work together to process the input commands, update the game state, and produce the correct output as specified.

Correctness: **True**
