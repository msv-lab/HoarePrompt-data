You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call:

    #State: n is the number of lines read from input, m is the total number of characters read across all lines, grid is a list of n lists where each sublist represents a line read from input with non-empty cells marked in the elements dictionary, elements is a dictionary mapping cell identifiers to their grid coordinates, allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two lists where each sublist contains the coordinates of 'B' or 'G' goals read from input, points is [0, 0]
    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()

                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))

    #State: Output State: `t` is 0, `n` is 0, `m` is 0, `grid` is an empty list, `elements` is an empty dictionary, `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is [0, 0].
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, but since `t` is initially set to 0, the loop does not execute at all. Therefore, no changes are made to any of the variables inside the loop. The `allPlayers` dictionary remains empty, the `grid` remains an empty list, and the `points` list remains [0, 0].
    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))
    #This is printed: FINAL SCORE: 0 0
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
