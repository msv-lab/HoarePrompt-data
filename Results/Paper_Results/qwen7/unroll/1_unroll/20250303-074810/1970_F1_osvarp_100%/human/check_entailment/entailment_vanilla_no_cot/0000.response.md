Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that make it incorrect based on the problem description:

1. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly handle the movement and actions of the players and the Quaffle. Specifically, the logic for catching the Quaffle and throwing it is flawed. The program does not properly update the position of the Quaffle when a player throws it.

2. **Scoring Logic:**
   - The scoring logic is incomplete. The program does not correctly identify when a player scores a goal and updates the points accordingly. For example, the program should check if a player is moving towards a goal and if so, increment the score for the appropriate team.

3. **Goal Checking:**
   - The function `goalIn` is not used correctly. It should be called whenever a player is moving towards a goal to check if a goal is scored, but the program does not do this.

4. **Elimination Logic:**
   - The elimination logic is incorrect. The program does not handle the scenario where a player is eliminated (e.g., when a player is caught by another player or when a player scores in their own goal).

5. **Golden Snitch Handling:**
   - The program incorrectly handles the golden snitch. The golden snitch is not mentioned in the problem description, and the code for handling it is unnecessary and incorrect.

6. **Initial Setup:**
   - The initial setup of the grid and the elements dictionary is incomplete. The program does not initialize the `mov` dictionary, which is used for movement directions.

7. **Final Score Output:**
   - The final score output is incorrect. The program should output the final score after all actions have been processed, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

Here is a corrected version of the program with the necessary fixes:

```python
from sys import stdin

# Function to define movement directions
mov = {'U': (-1, 0), 'D': (1, 0), 'L': (0, -1), 'R': (0, 1)}

# Function to check if an element is a player
def isPlayer(el):
    return el[0] in ['R', 'B'] and el[1] != 'G'

# Function to check if a position is a goal
def goalIn(pos, goal_positions):
    for g in goal_positions:
        if pos == g:
            return True
    return False

# Function to process the game actions
def func_1():
    (n, m) = map(int, stdin.readline().strip().split())
    grid = []
    elements = {'.B': (-1, -1)}
    allPlayers = {}
    goal = [[], []]
    points = [0, 0]

    for i in range(n):
        line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        grid.append(line)
        for ind in range(len(line)):
            if line[ind] != '..':
                elements[line[ind]] = (i, ind)
                if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                    allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
                elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                    tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                    goal[tmp].append((i, ind))

    t = int(stdin.readline().strip())
    for time in range(t):
        comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
        if len(comand) == 3:
            (obj, com, el) = comand
            if el == '.Q':
                allPlayers[obj] = True
            elif el == '.S':
                team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
                points[team] += 10
                print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, 'BLUE' if team == 1 else 'RED'))
        else:
            (obj, com) = comand
            pos = elements[obj]
            nxt = (pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1])
            if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or (isPlayer(obj) and elements['.B'] == nxt):
                player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
                print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
            elif com == 'T':
                allPlayers[obj] = False
                if goalIn(nxt, goal[1]):
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, 'BLUE'))
                    points[1] += 1
                elif goalIn(nxt, goal[0]):
                    print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, 'RED'))
                    points[0] += 1
            elif isPlayer(obj):
                elements[obj] = nxt
            if obj == '.B':
                elements[obj] = nxt

    print('FINAL SCORE: %d %d' % (points[0], points[1]))

func_1()
```

This corrected version should handle the game actions and scoring correctly according to the problem description.
