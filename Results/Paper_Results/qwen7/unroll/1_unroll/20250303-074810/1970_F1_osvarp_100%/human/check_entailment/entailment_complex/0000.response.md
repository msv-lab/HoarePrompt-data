Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly initializes the game state by reading the grid dimensions, setting up the grid, and parsing the initial state of the game including players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also correctly handles the sequence of actions and updates the game state accordingly. The function checks for valid actions such as movement, catching, and throwing the Quaffle, and it correctly identifies when a goal is scored or a player is eliminated. The function also correctly updates the points for each team and prints the final scores at the end of the game.
2. **Function `goalIn`**: This function correctly determines which team's goal a given position belongs to by checking if the position is in the set of goals for the red or blue team. It returns the appropriate team index (0 for red, 1 for blue) or -1 if the position is not a goal.
3. **Function `isPlayer`**: This function correctly identifies whether a given entity is a player by checking if the first character is 'R' or 'B' and the second character is not 'G'.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the functions `func_1`, `goalIn`, and `isPlayer` collectively handle the game logic correctly. They process the input, update the game state, and produce the expected output as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
