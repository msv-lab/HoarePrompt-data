### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the annotated code step-by-step to understand what it does and whether it correctly implements the solution for the given problem.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `func_1()` reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - `func_3()` reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`arr`).

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, the code initializes `m` as the maximum value in the array `arr`.
   - It creates a new list `new` where each element is calculated as `m - arr[i] + 1`. This transformation ensures that the elements in `new` are non-negative and represent the "distance" from the maximum value `m`.
   - The list `new` is then sorted.
   - A set `ans` is initialized to store unique values.
   - For each element in `new`, if the element is less than or equal to `n` and greater than 0, it is added to the set `ans`.
   - Finally, the size of the set `ans` is printed, which represents the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The transformation `m - arr[i] + 1` ensures that the new values are non-negative and represent the "distance" from the maximum value `m`.
   - Sorting the transformed values helps in determining the maximum frequency of any number in the array after adding a permutation.
   - Using a set to store unique values ensures that we count only distinct values, which is crucial for determining the maximum frequency.

Given the above analysis, the annotated code correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of elements equal to the same number after adding a permutation. The steps are logically sound and align with the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the required functionality to solve the problem.
