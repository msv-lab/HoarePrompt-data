Output State: **`arr` is a list of positive integers; `ans` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `ans`. The initial state of `arr` as a list of positive integers remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes both the unchanged list `arr` and the newly initialized empty list `ans`.
