Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Introverts and Extroverts:**
   - The program incorrectly combines the count of extroverts and universals into `b + c`. This does not accurately represent the constraints because:
     - An extrovert needs a tent with exactly 2 others, and adding universals to this count doesn't reflect the exact requirement.
     - The program then attempts to use `-b // 3` which is incorrect for determining the number of tents needed.

2. **Incorrect Condition Check:**
   - The condition check `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]` is flawed. It does not properly account for the number of tents needed for introverts and the remaining extroverts and universals.

3. **Logic for Tents Calculation:**
   - The program should ensure that:
     - Each introvert gets a separate tent.
     - Extroverts need to be paired with others, and universals can fill in the gaps.
     - The calculation should ensure that the number of tents is minimized while respecting all preferences.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (a, b, c) = map(int, s.split())
        # Tents needed for introverts
        tents_for_introverts = a
        # Remaining people after assigning tents to introverts
        remaining_people = b + c
        
        # Tents needed for extroverts
        tents_for_extroverts = -(-remaining_people // 3)  # Ceiling division
        
        # Total tents
        total_tents = tents_for_introverts + tents_for_extroverts
        
        # Check if it's possible to accommodate everyone
        if remaining_people % 3 != 0 and c == 0:
            total_tents = -1
        
        print(total_tents)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the number of tents needed by ensuring that:
- Each introvert gets a separate tent.
- The remaining people (extroverts and universals) are accommodated in tents with exactly 3 people each.
- It handles the case where it's impossible to accommodate all extroverts with universals.
