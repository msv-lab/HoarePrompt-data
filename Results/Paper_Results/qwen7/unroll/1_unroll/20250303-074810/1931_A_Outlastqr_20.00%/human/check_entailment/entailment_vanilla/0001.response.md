Let's reason through the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   - This part is handled correctly.

2. **Encoding Logic**:
   - The program aims to find the lexicographically smallest word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - It uses the following logic:
     - If `n > 52`, it means the third character is beyond 'z'. This is not possible since we are limited to 3-character words with each character being a lowercase Latin letter ('a' to 'z').
     - If `n > 26`, it means the second character is beyond 'z', which again is not possible.
     - Otherwise, the word is formed by the first two characters being 'a' and the third character being the character at position `n - 3` in the alphabet.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle the case where `n <= 3`. In such cases, the word should be 'aaa'.
   - The program also does not handle the case where `n` is between 27 and 52, which requires more complex logic to form the correct word.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the constructed word for each test case.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Case 1**: When `n <= 26`
  - The word is 'aaa' because the smallest possible word is 'aaa' and any other combination would be larger.
  - Example: For `n = 3`, the word is 'aaa'.

- **Case 2**: When `n > 26` and `n <= 52`
  - The word is formed by 'a' for the first two characters and the character at position `n - 3` for the third character.
  - Example: For `n = 27`, the word is 'azz' (since 'a' is at position 1 and 'z' is at position 26).

- **Case 3**: When `n > 52`
  - This case is not handled correctly. The program incorrectly assumes the third character is beyond 'z', which is impossible.

### Correctness Evaluation:

- The program fails to handle the edge cases properly, particularly when `n <= 26` and when `n` is between 27 and 52.
- The logic for forming the word when `n > 26` and `n <= 52` is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect due to the failure to handle edge cases and the incorrect logic for forming the word when `n > 26`.

**Correctness: False**
