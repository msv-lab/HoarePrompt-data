### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect because the logic for calculating the MEX and constructing the permutation does not match the problem requirements. Specifically, the current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX for each prefix of the permutation and adjust the permutation accordingly.

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to identify the issues and propose a correct solution.

#### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect MEX Calculation:**
   - The current logic does not correctly compute the MEX for each prefix of the permutation.
   - The update of `mex` inside the loop is not consistent with the definition of MEX.

2. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The permutation `p` is not constructed correctly to satisfy the condition \(a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i\).

#### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
1. Initialize the permutation `p` with the values from 0 to n-1.
2. Compute the MEX for each prefix of the permutation and adjust the permutation accordingly.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = list(range(n))  # Initialize permutation with values from 0 to n-1
        res = []
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            seen = set()
            for j in range(i + 1):
                seen.add(p[j])
            while mex in seen:
                mex += 1
            res.append(mex - ar[i])
            p[i] = mex  # Update the permutation with the computed MEX
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))

# Example usage
func()
```

#### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize the permutation `p` with values from 0 to n-1.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - For each index `i`, we compute the MEX for the prefix `p[0:i+1]`.
   - We use a set to keep track of the elements already seen in the prefix.
   - We increment `mex` until we find the smallest non-negative integer not in the set.

3. **Adjustment:**
   - We update the result array `res` with `mex - ar[i]`.
   - We update the permutation `p` with the computed MEX.

This approach ensures that the permutation `p` is constructed correctly to satisfy the given condition.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the corrected approach, the original assessment was accurate. The original program did not correctly implement the MEX calculation and permutation construction logic.

**Final: False**
