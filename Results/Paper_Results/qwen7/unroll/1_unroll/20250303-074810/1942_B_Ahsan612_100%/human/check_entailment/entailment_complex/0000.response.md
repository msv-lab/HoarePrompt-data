Reasoning:
1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided solution attempts to reverse-engineer the permutation \( p \) from the array \( a \) by calculating the MEX value for each position in reverse order.
3. The logic in the code is as follows:
   - Initialize `mex` to `n`.
   - Iterate over the array `ar` in reverse order.
   - For each element in `ar`, calculate `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - Update `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if the current `mex` is greater than the calculated value.
4. The approach ensures that the resulting permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) because:
   - When calculating `res[i]`, `mex` is correctly set to the smallest unused index.
   - By decrementing `mex` appropriately, the algorithm ensures that the next value of `mex` is correctly determined for the next iteration.
5. The code handles multiple test cases and processes each one correctly according to the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
