Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the array `ar` of size `n`.

2. **Result Array Initialization:**
   - It initializes a result array `res` of size `n` with `None` values.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to `n`.

3. **Backward Iteration and Calculation:**
   - The program iterates backward through the array `ar` using a `for` loop.
   - For each element `ar[i]`, it calculates `res[i]` as `mex - ar[i]`.
   - It updates `mex` to `mex - ar[i]` if `mex` is greater than `mex - ar[i]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result array `res` as a space-separated string.

### Reasoning:

1. **Backward Iteration Logic:**
   - The logic in the loop seems to be trying to calculate the permutation `p` based on the given array `ar`.
   - However, the calculation `res[i] = mex - ar[i]` and updating `mex` might not correctly reflect the MEX operation as defined in the problem statement.

2. **MEX Calculation:**
   - The MEX of an array should be the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
   - The current logic does not correctly handle the MEX calculation for the permutation construction.

3. **Permutation Construction:**
   - The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` such that `a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i`.
   - The current approach does not ensure that the resulting `p` satisfies this condition for all `i`.

### Example Verification:

Let's verify the given example with the provided solution:

#### Input:
```
3
5
1 1 -2 1 2
5
1 1 1 1 1
3
-2 1 2
```

#### Expected Output:
```
0 1 4 2 3
0 1 2 3 4
2 0 1
```

#### Actual Output:
```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = [None] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        print(' '.join((str(x) for x in res)))
```

Running the above code with the given input does not produce the expected output. Let's manually check the logic:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - `ar = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`
   - `mex = 5`
   - Iterations:
     - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 2 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4`, `mex = 4`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - Result: `[2, 3, 4, 3, 2]` (which is incorrect)

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - `ar = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `mex = 5`
   - Iterations:
     - `i = 4`: `res[4] = 5 - 1 = 4`, `mex = 4`
     - `i = 3`: `res[3] = 4 - 1 = 3`, `mex = 3`
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - 1 = 2`, `mex = 2`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 2 - 1 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
   - Result: `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (which is correct but not the only valid solution)

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - `ar = [-2, 1, 2]`
   - `mex = 3`
   - Iterations:
     - `i = 2`: `res[2] = 3 - 2 = 1`, `mex = 1`
     - `i = 1`: `res[1] = 1 - 1 = 0`, `mex = 0`
     - `i = 0`: `res[0] = 0 - (-2) = 2`, `mex = 2`
   - Result: `[2, 0, 1]` (which is correct)

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly implement the MEX calculation and permutation construction logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
