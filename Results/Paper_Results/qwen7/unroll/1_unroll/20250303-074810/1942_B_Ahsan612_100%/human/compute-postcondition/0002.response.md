Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5; for each test case, ar is a list of n integers such that -n ≤ a_i ≤ n; for each test case, res is a list of n integers representing the result of the loop, where each element res[i] is calculated as mex - ar[i] with mex being decremented accordingly from n to 0 as the loop iterates backwards through ar.
