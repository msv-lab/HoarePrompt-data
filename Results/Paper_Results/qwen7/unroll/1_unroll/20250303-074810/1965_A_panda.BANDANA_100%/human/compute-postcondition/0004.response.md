Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a containing n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result based on the processed data for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case, adhering to the specified constraints.
