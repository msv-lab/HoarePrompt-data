### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided code.

#### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to count the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the conditions of having specific prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves combinatorial logic and dynamic programming, but the provided code does not implement any such logic.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function implements the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to find the modular inverse of a number \( a \) modulo \( b \).
   - The function returns a tuple \((c, d)\) where \( c \) is the modular inverse of \( a \) modulo \( b \) and \( d \) is some auxiliary value used in the EEA process.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses the result from `func_1` to compute \( a \mod 1000000007 \).
   - It takes an integer \( a \) and a list of tuples `b`, but the function `func_1` is only called with `b` and the constant \( 1000000007 \).

Given these observations, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are indeed unrelated to solving the permutation problem. They are instead focused on modular arithmetic operations, specifically finding modular inverses.

Since the provided code does not attempt to solve the permutation problem, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not address the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unrelated to the problem and do not contribute to solving it.
