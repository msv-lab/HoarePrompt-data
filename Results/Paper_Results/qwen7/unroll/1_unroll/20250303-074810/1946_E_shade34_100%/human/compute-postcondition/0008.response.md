Output State: **The program returns 1 and -(a // b - 1)**

Given the initial state where `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` is not zero, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and the remainder of `a` divided by `b` is 0, we know that `a` is divisible by `b`. Therefore, `a // b` gives the quotient when `a` is divided by `b`.

The expression `- (a // b - 1)` simplifies to `1 - (a // b)`. Since `a` is exactly divisible by `b`, `a // b` is the integer quotient of `a` divided by `b`. Let's denote this quotient as `q`. So, `a = q * b`.

Therefore, the expression becomes `1 - q`. Given that `q = a // b`, the final result is `1 - (a // b)`.

Thus, the program returns `1` and `1 - (a // b)`.
