Output State: **The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` modulo 1000000007.**

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers `(c, d)` such that \(1 \leq c, d \leq 10^9 + 6\) and \(d \neq 0\).
- `c` is a value returned from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.
- `d` is a value returned from `func_1(b, 1000000007)`.

The code snippet `return c * a % 1000000007` returns the value of `c` (which is the result of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`) multiplied by `a`, and then takes the result modulo \(1000000007\). Therefore, the output state is the value of `c` times `a` modulo \(1000000007\).
