### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

#### Problem Understanding
The problem requires finding the number of permutations of length \( n \) that satisfy the given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums. The solution involves combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic.

#### Functions Provided
1. **`func_1(a, b)`**: This function attempts to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA) to find the coefficients \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( ax + by = \gcd(a, b) \). However, the implementation is incorrect and does not handle the general case where \( \gcd(a, b) \neq 1 \).

2. **`func_2(a, b)`**: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute \( a \times b^{-1} \mod 1000000007 \), which is the modular multiplicative inverse of \( b \) modulo \( 1000000007 \). Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also be incorrect.

#### Usage in the Problem
The main part of the program performs the following steps:
1. Precompute factorials up to \( 200002 \) modulo \( 1000000007 \).
2. For each test case:
   - Check if the given prefix and suffix maximums are consistent.
   - Compute the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods involving factorials and modular inverses.

#### Correctness of Functions
- **`func_1`**: As mentioned, the implementation is incorrect and does not handle the general case. This means it cannot correctly compute the modular multiplicative inverse.
- **`func_2`**: Since `func_1` is incorrect, `func_2` will also be incorrect.

#### Combinatorial Counting
The program uses combinatorial counting to calculate the number of valid permutations. Specifically, it uses the precomputed factorials and modular inverses to perform the necessary calculations. However, since the modular inverses are computed incorrectly, the overall result will be incorrect.

#### Conclusion
Given that the provided functions do not correctly compute the modular multiplicative inverses, the entire program will produce incorrect results. Therefore, the given code does not solve the problem correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
