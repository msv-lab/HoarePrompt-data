Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to be related to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. Instead, they appear to be implementing extended Euclidean algorithm for finding modular inverses, which is not relevant to the given problem.

To solve the problem, we would need to construct permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums. The provided code does not attempt to do this, and therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
