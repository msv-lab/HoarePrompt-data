Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to modular multiplicative inverses, but they are not used in a way that addresses the core problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The problem requires a more complex combinatorial approach to count the permutations that satisfy the given conditions, which is not reflected in the provided code.
