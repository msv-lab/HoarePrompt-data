Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy the given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution involves combinatorial counting and modular arithmetic.

2. **Functions Provided**:
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function appears to implement the Extended Euclidean Algorithm (EEA). It calculates the coefficients `x` and `y` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`. However, the implementation seems to be incorrect because it does not handle the general case where `gcd(a, b) != 1`.
   - `func_2(a, b)`: This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute `a * b^{-1} \mod 1000000007`, which is the modular multiplicative inverse of `b` modulo `1000000007`.

3. **Correctness of Functions**:
   - `func_1` is supposed to solve the equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)` but only returns a solution when `a` and `b` are coprime (`gcd(a, b) == 1`). For other cases, it may return incorrect results or fail to terminate.
   - `func_2` relies on `func_1` to find the modular inverse. If `func_1` fails, `func_2` will also fail.

4. **Usage in the Problem**:
   - The problem requires combinatorial counting, specifically calculating binomial coefficients and factorials under modulo `1000000007`. These calculations typically involve modular inverses and modular arithmetic operations.
   - The functions provided do not seem to be used in the context of solving the problem. Instead, the problem would require more specific combinatorial logic and potentially dynamic programming or inclusion-exclusion principles.

### Conclusion

Given that the provided functions do not appear to be used correctly or appropriately for the problem, and considering the complexity of the problem (involving combinatorial counting), the given code does not seem to be a correct solution to the problem.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
