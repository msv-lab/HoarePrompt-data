Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Preprocessing:**
   - The program initializes a list `facts` with factorials up to 200002, modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is used for combinatorial calculations later.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.

2. **Test Case Processing:**
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
   - It then reads the indices of the prefix maximums `p` and the suffix maximums `s`.

3. **Validation:**
   - The program checks if the last index of the prefix maximums matches the first index of the suffix maximums, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, it prints 0, indicating no valid permutations exist.

4. **Combinatorial Calculations:**
   - The program uses the `func_2` function to compute combinations using the precomputed factorials.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between each pair of consecutive suffix maximums.
   - Similarly, it iterates over the prefix maximums in reverse order and calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between each pair of consecutive prefix maximums.
   - Finally, it multiplies these values together to get the total number of valid permutations.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   - All intermediate results are taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\) to handle large numbers.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums are valid and consistent with the constraints.

Given the detailed logic and the correct handling of edge cases, the provided code appears to be correct according to the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
