### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem described.

1. **Function `func_1` (Extended Euclidean Algorithm):**
   - This function computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
   - It returns a tuple `(x, y)` such that `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`.
   - This function is used in `func_2` to compute modular inverses, but it is not directly related to solving the permutation problem.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function uses the result of `func_1` to compute the modular inverse of `a` modulo `1000000007`.
   - The modular inverse is used in the main logic of the program, but again, it is not directly related to solving the permutation problem.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program involves calculating combinations (`cnk`) using the `func_2` function.
   - It iterates over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums to calculate the number of valid permutations.
   - Specifically, it calculates combinations using factorials stored in the `facts` list, which is precomputed up to `200002`.

Let's break down the main logic:

- **Initialization:**
  - Precompute factorials up to `200002` and store them in the `facts` list.
  - Read the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, read the length of the permutation `n`, the number of prefix maximums `m1`, and the number of suffix maximums `m2`.
  - Read the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

- **Validation:**
  - Check if the last prefix maximum index matches the first suffix maximum index, and if the first prefix maximum index is `1` and the last suffix maximum index is `n`. If any of these conditions fail, there are no valid permutations, so print `0`.

- **Combination Calculation:**
  - For each suffix maximum index `x`, calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements before and after `x` using combinations.
  - Similarly, for each prefix maximum index `x`, calculate the number of ways to arrange the elements before and after `x`.
  - Multiply these combinations together to get the total number of valid permutations.

- **Output:**
  - Print the result modulo `1000000007`.

Given the detailed breakdown, the code does indeed follow the steps required to solve the problem. It correctly precomputes factorials, validates the input, and calculates the number of valid permutations using combinations. The use of `func_1` and `func_2` is not directly related to the permutation calculation but is used in the combination calculations.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was inaccurate because the provided code does correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used in the context of calculating combinations, which is necessary for determining the number of valid permutations.

**Final: True**
