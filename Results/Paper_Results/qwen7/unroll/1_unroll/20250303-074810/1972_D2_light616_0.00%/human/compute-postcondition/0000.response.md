Output State: **`x` is 1, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^6, and the square root of `n` is less than or equal to the maximum possible value derived from the conditions (x + y) * x <= n and (x + y) * y <= m, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.**

Explanation: The code sets `x` to 1. The initial conditions for `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and the relationship between `n` and `m` based on the given constraints also remains valid.
