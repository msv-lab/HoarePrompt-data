Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case consists of two integers: t and n. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, it performs some unspecified operation and returns a result based on the values of t and n.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t and an integer n. The function checks if t is within the range 1 to 10^4 (inclusive) and n is within the range 1 to 10^9 (inclusive). Based on the values of t and n, the function performs an unspecified operation and returns a result for each test case.
