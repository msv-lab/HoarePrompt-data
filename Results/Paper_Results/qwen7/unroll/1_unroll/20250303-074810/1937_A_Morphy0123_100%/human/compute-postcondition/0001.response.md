State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop head contains `i` and `n_cases`.
2. Determine the initial value of `i`: In the `range(n_cases)` function, `i` starts from 0.
3. Ensure the loop condition is met: For the loop to execute, `n_cases` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is initialized to 0 and `n_cases` is a positive integer. The initial value of `t` (which is not relevant to the loop execution) remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer, `i` must be 0**
