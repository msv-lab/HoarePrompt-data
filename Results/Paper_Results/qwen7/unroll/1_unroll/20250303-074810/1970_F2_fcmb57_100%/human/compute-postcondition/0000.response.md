Output State: **`a` is assigned to `x` and `y`, `b` remains unchanged**.

In this code snippet, the variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values of `a` and `b` respectively. Since `a` and `b` are initially integers representing the dimensions of the field, `x` will now hold the value of `a` and `y` will hold the value of `b`. The initial values of `b` remain unchanged.
