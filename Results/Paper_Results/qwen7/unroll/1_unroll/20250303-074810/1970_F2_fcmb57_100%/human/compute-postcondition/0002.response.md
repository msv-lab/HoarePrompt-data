Output State: **The program returns x plus dx, and y plus dy.**

Given the initial state:
- `a` is assigned to both `x` and `y`, meaning `x = a` and `y = a`.
- `b` is split into `dx` and `dy`.

The code snippet `return x + dx, y + dy` means that the program will add `dx` to the current value of `x` and `dy` to the current value of `y`, and then return these new values as a tuple.

So, the output state is:
- The program returns `x` which is `a` plus `dx`.
- The program returns `y` which is `a` plus `dy`.
