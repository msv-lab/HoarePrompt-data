Output State: **`a` is assigned to `x` and `y`, `b` is split into `dx` and `dy`.**

In this case, the initial state had `a` assigned to both `x` and `y`, and `b` remained unchanged. The code `dx, dy = b` unpacks `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Since no specific values were given for `b`, `dx` and `dy` will take the values from `b` in order. The values of `a`, `x`, `y`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial state.
