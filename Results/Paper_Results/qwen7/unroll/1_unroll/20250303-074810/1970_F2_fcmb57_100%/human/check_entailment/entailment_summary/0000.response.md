Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle based on the input.
2. The program processes each move or action step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
3. The program handles the elimination of players when they collide with Bludgers, ensuring that the correct player is eliminated and the Quaffle's state is updated.
4. The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score and the Quaffle's position.
5. The program prints the events in the correct order, including the final score.
6. The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity based on the direction of movement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the rules and logic specified in the problem statement accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
