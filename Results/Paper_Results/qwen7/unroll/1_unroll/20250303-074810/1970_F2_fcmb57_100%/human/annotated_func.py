#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters. The list has N strings. Each character in the strings can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', '.Q', '.B'. The integers P, T, and the sequence of actions are also provided, where 1 ≤ P ≤ 10 and 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x plus dx, and y plus dy.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `a` and `b`, each containing two integers. It returns a new tuple with the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the first tuple incremented by the corresponding values in the second tuple.
