Reasoning:

1. **Field Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field by parsing the input and storing the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle. It also sets up the Bludger and Quaffle's initial positions.

2. **Movement Logic**: The program correctly handles the movement of players and the Quaffle. It updates the positions of players and checks for collisions with the Bludger, leading to player elimination.

3. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and updates the score accordingly. It also correctly resets the Quaffle to the middle of the field when a goal is scored.

4. **Elimination Logic**: The program correctly identifies and prints player eliminations in the correct order.

5. **Final Score Calculation**: The program correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

6. **Function `func_1`**: The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity given a direction. This function is used consistently throughout the program.

Given that the program correctly handles all aspects of the problem, including field initialization, movement, scoring, elimination, and final score calculation, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
