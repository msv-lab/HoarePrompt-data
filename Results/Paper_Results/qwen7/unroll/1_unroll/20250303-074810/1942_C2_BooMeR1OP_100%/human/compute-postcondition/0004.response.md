Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on specific conditions involving these integers. The final output for each test case is stored in the variable `ans`, which represents the computed result under the given constraints.**
