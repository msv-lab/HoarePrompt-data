You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It calculates and prints a result for each test case based on specific conditions involving these integers. The final output for each test case is stored in the variable `ans`, which represents the computed result under the given constraints.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the remaining vertices (after choosing `x` vertices) are insufficient to form additional triangles even if `y` additional vertices are chosen.

Let's consider the following test case:
```
4 2 2
1 3
```
Here, `n = 4`, `x = 2`, and `y = 2`. The chosen vertices are `1` and `3`.

The program calculates the initial number of triangles as `x - 2 = 0`. It then checks for adjacent vertices and finds that `(1 + 1) % 4 = 2` and `(1 + 2) % 4 = 3` are already chosen, so no additional triangles can be formed from vertex `1`. Similarly, for vertex `3`, `(3 + 1) % 4 = 0` and `(3 + 2) % 4 = 1` are already chosen, so no additional triangles can be formed from vertex `3`.

Next, it sorts the gaps and tries to form triangles using the gaps. However, since there are no gaps greater than 1, the program incorrectly returns `0` as the number of triangles, which is incorrect because we can form 2 triangles by choosing the remaining vertices `2` and `4`.

A correct approach would be to ensure that after forming the initial triangles with the chosen vertices, the remaining vertices are checked to see if they can form additional triangles. The program should also ensure that the remaining vertices are sufficient to form the required number of triangles based on the value of `y`.

Since the program does not handle this case correctly, the correctness is **False**.
