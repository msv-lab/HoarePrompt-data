Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of multiple test cases. Each test case includes three integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

- For each test case, the function accepts integers `n`, `x`, and `y` where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, `2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5)`, and `0 ≤ y ≤ n - x`.
- It also accepts a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- The function returns a result for each test case, which could be a specific value or a set of values depending on the problem's requirements.
