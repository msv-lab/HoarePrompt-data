Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and processes each test case individually. This is done correctly using a loop that iterates `ntest` times.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`). It then sorts the array.

3. **Beauty Calculation**: After sorting, the program calculates the beauty of the array as the difference between the largest and smallest elements. This is done by subtracting the first element (smallest) from the last element (largest) in the sorted array.

4. **Output**: The result is printed for each test case, which is the correct output format specified in the problem statement.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles all specified constraints and examples correctly. For instance:
   - In the first example, sorting `[2, 1, 3]` results in `[1, 2, 3]`, and the difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.
   - In the second example, the array `[69, 69, 69]` remains unchanged after sorting, and the difference is `69 - 69 = 0`.
   - In the third example, sorting `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]` results in `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the difference is `100 - 43 = 57`.

Given that the program correctly processes each test case according to the problem statement and produces the expected output for the provided examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
