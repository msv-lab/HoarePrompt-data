The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. For each test case, it sorts the list of integers and calculates the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in the sorted list. It then prints this difference for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value, but outputs the differences for each test case.
