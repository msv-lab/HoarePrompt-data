### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. When the array is sorted, the largest element minus the smallest element will give us the maximum possible difference, and this difference will be the maximum beauty since the differences between other consecutive elements will be minimized.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the maximum difference between the smallest and largest elements is calculated.
   - However, the program only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not necessarily give the maximum beauty of the array. The beauty is the sum of the differences between all consecutive elements, not just the maximum difference between the smallest and largest elements.

Let's consider a few examples to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

- **Example 1**: Input: `3 2 1 3`
  - Sorted array: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Output: `3 - 1 = 2`
  - Correct output: `(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2`

- **Example 2**: Input: `5 100 54 80 43 90`
  - Sorted array: `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`
  - Output: `100 - 43 = 57`
  - Correct output: `(54 - 100) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) = -46 + 26 + 10 = 0`

- **Example 3**: Input: `4 3 4 3 3`
  - Sorted array: `[3, 3, 3, 4]`
  - Output: `4 - 3 = 1`
  - Correct output: `(3 - 4) + (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) = -1 + 0 + 0 = -1`

The program only considers the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not account for the sum of differences between all consecutive elements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array. The program only finds the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array.

**Final: False**
