### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1})\).

2. **Key Insight**: To maximize this sum, we want to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the difference between the largest and smallest elements. However, simply sorting the array and printing the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array. The beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, not just the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It prints the difference between the last (largest) and first (smallest) elements of the sorted array.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the array and printing the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty of the array. The beauty is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and sorting only ensures that the largest and smallest elements are at the ends, but it does not ensure that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
   - For example, consider the array \([1, 100, 2]\). If we sort it, we get \([1, 2, 100]\), and the difference between the largest and smallest elements is \(100 - 1 = 99\). However, the actual beauty is \((100 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 99\), which is the same as the difference between the largest and smallest elements. But for an array like \([1, 100, 2, 3]\), sorting gives \([1, 2, 3, 100]\), and the difference is still \(100 - 1 = 99\), but the beauty is \((100 - 3) + (3 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 98\), which is less than 99. Therefore, sorting and taking the difference between the largest and smallest elements does not always yield the maximum beauty.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. It only calculates the difference between the largest and smallest elements after sorting, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

**Correctness:** **False**

Final: **False**
