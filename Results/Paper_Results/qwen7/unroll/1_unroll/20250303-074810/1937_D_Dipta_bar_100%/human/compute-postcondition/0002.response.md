Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`, `A` is an empty list, `idx_A` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `idx_A = []` creates an empty list and assigns it to the variable `idx_A`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `A`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `s` and `A`, along with the new value of `idx_A`.
