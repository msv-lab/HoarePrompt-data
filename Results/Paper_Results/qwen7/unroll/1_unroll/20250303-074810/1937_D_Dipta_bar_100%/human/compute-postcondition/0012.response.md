Output State: **`l` is 0, `idx_B` is a list containing all indices `i` where `s[i] == '>'` from right to left, `B` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element in `B` and the difference between the current index and the previous index in `idx_B`, `r` is the length of `B`.**

The code `r = len(B)` calculates the length of the list `B` and assigns it to the variable `r`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the length of `B` is stored in `r`, while the values of `l` and `idx_B` remain unchanged.
