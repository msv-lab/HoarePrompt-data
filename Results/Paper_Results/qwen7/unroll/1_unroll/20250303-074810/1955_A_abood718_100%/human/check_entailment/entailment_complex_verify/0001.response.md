### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

#### Promotion vs Regular Price:
- The program checks if the regular price of two yogurts (`b * 2`) is less than the promotion price (`c`).
  - If `b * 2 < c`, it means it's cheaper to buy yogurts at the regular price. Therefore, the total cost is `A * B`.
  - If `b * 2 >= c`, it means it's cheaper to take advantage of the promotion. The program then checks if `A` (the number of yogurts) is even.
    - If `A` is even, it directly calculates the total cost as `int(A * C / 2)`.
    - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost by buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and then buying the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles the case where the number of yogurts `A` is odd by splitting it into the maximum number of pairs that can be bought at the promotion price and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.
- This approach ensures that the total cost is minimized.

#### Verification with Examples:
- **Example 1**:
  - Input: `2 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is greater than `C = 9`), so it's cheaper to buy at the promotion price.
  - Since `A = 2` is even, the cost is `int(2 * 9 / 2) = 9`.
  - Output: `9` (Correct).

- **Example 2**:
  - Input: `3 5 9`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is greater than `C = 9`), so it's cheaper to buy at the promotion price.
  - Since `A = 3` is odd, the cost is `int(1 * 9 / 1) + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14`.
  - Output: `14` (Correct).

- **Example 3**:
  - Input: `3 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is less than `C = 11`), so it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
  - Since `A = 3` is odd, the cost is `3 * 5 = 15`.
  - Output: `15` (Correct).

- **Example 4**:
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - `B * 2 = 10` (which is less than `C = 11`), so it's cheaper to buy at the regular price.
  - Since `A = 4` is even, the cost is `4 * 5 = 20`.
  - Output: `20` (Correct).

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts considering both the regular and promotion prices. It handles all edge cases appropriately.

**Final: True**

The original assessment was accurate.
