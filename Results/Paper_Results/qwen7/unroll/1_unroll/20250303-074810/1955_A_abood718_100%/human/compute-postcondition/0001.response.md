Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, for each test case, if \(B \times 2 < C\), it will print \(A \times B\). If \(B \times 2 \geq C\) and \(A\) is even, it will print \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, it will print \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\).

This output state will be a list of integers, one for each test case processed within the loop.
