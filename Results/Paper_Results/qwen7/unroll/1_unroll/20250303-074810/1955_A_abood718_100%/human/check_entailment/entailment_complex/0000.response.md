Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- The logic inside the loop is designed to calculate the minimum cost based on the given conditions:
  - If the price of two yogurts (`b`) is less than the price of one yogurt (`a`), it's cheaper to buy all yogurts at the promotional price.
  - If the total number of yogurts (`n`) is even, it's optimal to buy all yogurts in pairs.
  - If the total number of yogurts is odd, it buys as many pairs as possible at the promotional price and the remaining one at the regular price.
- The conditions and calculations within the function match the problem statement accurately.
- The function handles all given examples correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
