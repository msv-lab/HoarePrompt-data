Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for loop execution**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer. Since `t` is given to be within the range 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, we need to ensure that `t` is a valid integer within this range.

3. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that `t` is set to a value within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is a valid integer within the range 1 to 5 ⋅ 10^4.

**State:**
**`t` is an input integer that must be within the range 1 to 5 ⋅ 10^4**
