Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the given logic within the loop. For each test case defined by `t`, the program processes values of `n` and `k` to compute and print specific integers according to the described algorithm. Specifically, it calculates a sequence `L` where each element `m` is derived from `n` by repeatedly setting `m = (n + 1) // 2` and decrementing `n` by `m`. Then, it determines and prints an integer based on the position `k` within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`.
