Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
3. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
4. It constructs a list `L` where each element `m` represents the count of cards that can be laid down at each step (i.e., `m = (n + 1) // 2`).
5. It then iterates over the list `L` to determine the exact card that would be placed at position `k` based on the cumulative sums.
6. The logic inside the loop correctly identifies the segment of `L` that contains the `k`-th card and calculates its value based on the multiplier `pow`.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the correct logic as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
