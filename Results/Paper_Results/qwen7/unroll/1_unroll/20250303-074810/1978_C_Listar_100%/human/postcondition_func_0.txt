The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 2â‹…10^5) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 10^12). It first halves the value of `k`. Then, it iterates through a list of numbers from 1 to `n`, decrementing `k` and modifying the list `l` based on certain conditions. If `k` reaches 0, it returns the list `l`. Otherwise, it calls another function `func_2` with updated parameters. Finally, the function ensures that `c` is 1, `k` is 0, and `l` contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
