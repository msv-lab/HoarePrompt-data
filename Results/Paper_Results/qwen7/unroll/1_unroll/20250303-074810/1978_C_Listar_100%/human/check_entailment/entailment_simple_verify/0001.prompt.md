You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

    8 14
    
    112 777

Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that its Manhattan value equals \( k \).
   - The Manhattan value is calculated as \( |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| \).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) is \( \frac{n^2 - 1}{2} \) when the permutation is reversed.
   - If \( k \) is odd, no permutation can achieve this because the Manhattan value is always even (sum of absolute differences).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - `func_4` checks if \( k \) is even and within the maximum possible Manhattan value for the given \( n \).
   - `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation by swapping elements to achieve the desired Manhattan value.
   - `func_2` and `func_3` handle specific swaps to adjust the permutation.

4. **Detailed Steps**:
   - `func_4` correctly identifies if \( k \) is even and within bounds.
   - `func_1` tries to build the permutation but has issues with logic and edge cases.
   - The swap functions (`func_2` and `func_3`) are intended to adjust the permutation but are not fully implemented to handle all cases.

5. **Issues Identified**:
   - `func_1` does not handle all edge cases and may return incorrect permutations.
   - The logic in `func_1` is incomplete and relies on recursive calls without proper base cases.
   - The swap functions do not cover all necessary adjustments to achieve the exact Manhattan value.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the solution for finding a permutation with the specified Manhattan value. There are logical errors and missing parts in the implementation.

### Correctness:
**False**
