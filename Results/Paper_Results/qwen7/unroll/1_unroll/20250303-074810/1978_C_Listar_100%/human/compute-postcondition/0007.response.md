Output State: **The program returns the value of `l` which is the return value of `func_1(n, k)` and is also passed as an argument to `func_5(l)`**

This means that the program returns whatever value `func_1(n, k)` returns, and this value is then passed to `func_5(l)`. However, since no further operations are performed on `l` within the given code snippet, the return statement simply returns the value of `l`.
