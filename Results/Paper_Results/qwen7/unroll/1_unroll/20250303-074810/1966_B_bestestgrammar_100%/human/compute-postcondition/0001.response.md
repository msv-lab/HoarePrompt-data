Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `tc` and the variable `t`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for each value in the range from `0` to `t-1`. This means the loop will execute `t` times.

3. **Determine the initial state of `tc`**: Before the loop starts, `tc` is not yet defined because the loop hasn't started iterating. However, after the first iteration, `tc` will be set to `0`.

4. **Determine the state of `t`**: The variable `t` is initialized to an input value which is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

5. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and `tc` will be incremented in each iteration, the initial state should reflect that the loop can start executing.

Given this analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `t` must be greater than 0, and `tc` should be initialized to 0 (though it is not explicitly stated in the loop head, it is implied).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `tc` is 0**
