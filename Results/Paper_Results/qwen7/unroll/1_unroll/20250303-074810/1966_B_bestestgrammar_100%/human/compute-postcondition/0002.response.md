Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each tc in range(t), n and m are positive integers, gr is a list of n strings, each string has length m. After processing the grid according to the given logic, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO'.**

This output state describes the final configuration of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `t` remains the same as the initial state, and for each iteration `tc` in the range of `t`, the variables `n`, `m`, and `gr` are updated based on the input provided. The variable `ans` is set to either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the conditions checked within the loop.
