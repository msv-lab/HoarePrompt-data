Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid and constructs the grid `gr`.
3. It checks if the top-left corner (`gr[0][0]`) and the bottom-right corner (`gr[n-1][m-1]`) have the same color. If they do not, it sets `ans` to 'NO' because it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color if the corners are different.
4. If the corners are the same, it further checks if the entire row and column can be the same color by comparing adjacent elements. This is done to ensure that there are no conflicting colors within the rows and columns.
5. If any row or column contains conflicting colors, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
6. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to handle the problem correctly. It checks all necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color.

Correctness: **True**
