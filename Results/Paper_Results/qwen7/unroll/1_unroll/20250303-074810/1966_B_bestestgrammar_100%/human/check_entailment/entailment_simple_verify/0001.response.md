### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation involves selecting any two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if the top-left corner (0,0) and the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) have the same color.
     - If they do not, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If they do, it further checks if the entire first row and the entire first column are uniform in color.
       - If the first row or the first column is not uniform, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If all checks pass, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Initial Check:**
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the corners independently.
   - **Row and Column Checks:**
     - If the first row and the first column are uniform, it implies that the entire grid can be made uniform by performing operations along these rows and columns.
     - This logic is sound because:
       - If the first row is uniform, any operation involving this row will maintain its uniformity.
       - Similarly, if the first column is uniform, any operation involving this column will maintain its uniformity.
       - By extending these uniform rows and columns, the entire grid can be made uniform.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where the grid might already be uniform (as seen in some test cases).
   - It correctly identifies grids that cannot be uniformized (as seen in the first test case).

However, there are some critical issues with the provided solution:
- The solution only checks the uniformity of the first row and the first column. This is insufficient to guarantee that the entire grid can be made uniform.
- The solution assumes that if the first row and the first column are uniform, then the entire grid can be uniformized, which is not necessarily true. There could be other configurations where the grid cannot be uniformized even if the first row and column are uniform.

### Counterexample:
Consider the following grid:
```
BBW
BWB
BBW
```
- The first row and first column are uniform (both are 'B').
- However, it is impossible to make the entire grid uniform because the second row and second column contain both 'B' and 'W'.

### Conclusion:
The given solution is incorrect because it fails to account for all possible configurations of the grid. The logic that relies solely on the uniformity of the first row and column is insufficient to determine if the entire grid can be uniformized.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
