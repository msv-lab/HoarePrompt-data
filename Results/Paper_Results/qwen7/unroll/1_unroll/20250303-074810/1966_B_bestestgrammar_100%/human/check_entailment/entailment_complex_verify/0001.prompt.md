You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each tc in range(t), n and m are positive integers, gr is a list of n strings, each string has length m. After processing the grid according to the given logic, ans is either 'YES' or 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they are different, it checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same, and if all cells in the last row and last column are the same. Based on these checks, the function sets the variable `ans` to either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the conditions are met. Finally, the function prints `ans` for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
   - An operation involves selecting any two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution checks if the top-left corner (0,0) and the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) have the same color.
     - If they do not, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If they do, it further checks if the entire first row and the entire first column are uniform in color.
       - If the first row or the first column is not uniform, it sets `ans` to 'NO'.
     - If all checks pass, it sets `ans` to 'YES'.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - **Initial Check:** 
     - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors, it's impossible to make the entire grid the same color because no operation can change the color of the corners independently.
   - **Row and Column Checks:**
     - If the first row and the first column are uniform, it implies that the entire grid can be made uniform by performing operations along these rows and columns.
     - This logic is sound because:
       - If the first row is uniform, any operation involving this row will maintain its uniformity.
       - Similarly, if the first column is uniform, any operation involving this column will maintain its uniformity.
       - By extending these uniform rows and columns, the entire grid can be made uniform.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles edge cases where the grid might already be uniform (as seen in some test cases).
   - It correctly identifies grids that cannot be uniformized (as seen in the first test case).

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.
