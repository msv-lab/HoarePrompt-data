Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color through a series of operations.
2. The provided program checks if the top-left cell is the same as the bottom-right cell. If they are different, it further checks if all cells in the first row and first column are the same, and if all cells in the last row and last column are the same.
3. However, this approach is flawed because:
   - It only checks the first row and first column, but the grid can have different colors in other parts.
   - It doesn't account for the possibility of making all cells the same color through operations involving different rows and columns.
4. A correct solution would need to check if there exists a common color across the entire grid, which can be done by checking if all rows or all columns are uniform in color.

Given the flaws in the current implementation, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
