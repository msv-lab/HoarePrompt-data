The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer \( n \) and \( 2n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n} \). For each test case, it sorts the \( 2n \) integers and calculates the score as the sum of the first element of each consecutive pair of elements in the sorted list. The function prints the score for each test case and does not return any value.
