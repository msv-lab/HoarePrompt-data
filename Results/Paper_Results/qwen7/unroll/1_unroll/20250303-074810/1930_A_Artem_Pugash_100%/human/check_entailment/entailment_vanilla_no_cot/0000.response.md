Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution for the given problem. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the List**: For each test case, it reads `2n` integers, sorts them, and then iterates through the sorted list in pairs.
3. **Calculating Score**: During each iteration, it adds the first element of the pair (which is the smaller of the two due to sorting) to the score.
4. **Outputting Result**: Finally, it prints the accumulated score for each test case.

This approach ensures that at each step, the smallest available numbers are being paired together, which maximizes the score since \(\min(x, y)\) is always added to the score. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this method guarantees the optimal solution. Therefore, the program is correct.
