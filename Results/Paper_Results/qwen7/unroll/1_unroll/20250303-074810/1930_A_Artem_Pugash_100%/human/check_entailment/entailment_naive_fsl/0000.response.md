Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the strategy to maximize the score by always selecting the smallest two numbers available on the whiteboard. Since the list is sorted, taking the elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) ensures that we are always picking the minimum of the current pair. This approach guarantees the maximum possible score for any given set of 2n positive integers. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for the given examples.
