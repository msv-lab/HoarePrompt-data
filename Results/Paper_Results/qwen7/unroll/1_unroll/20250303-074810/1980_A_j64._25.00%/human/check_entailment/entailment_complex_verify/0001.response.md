### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly takes two parameters: `t` (number of test cases) and `test_cases` (a list of tuples containing `n`, `m`, and `a`).
   - The function iterates over each test case, extracting `n`, `m`, and `a` from the `test_cases` list.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - A list `freq` of size 7 is initialized to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - The loop iterates over each character in the string `a`, updating the frequency counts in the `freq` list.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**:
   - For each difficulty level, the function calculates the difference between `m` and the current frequency (`f`).
   - If this difference is greater than zero, it means additional problems are needed for that difficulty level.
   - The sum of all such differences gives the total number of missing problems for the current test case.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - The calculated number of missing problems for each test case is appended to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, the `results` list is returned.

5. **Main Program Execution**:
   - The main part of the program uses predefined `test_cases` and prints the results returned by `func_1`.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the logic in the `func_1` function matches the requirements accurately. It correctly calculates the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final:
**True**
