Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', and a function is defined to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.**

The code defines a function without executing it, so the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The function itself does not modify any external variables, so the precondition remains valid.
