State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers n and m such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a string a of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', `_` is now 0**.

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is used in the `for` loop. It is a common practice to use an underscore when the loop variable is not needed within the loop body.
- The loop will execute `t` times, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
- Before the loop starts, `_` is not initialized, so it needs to be set to 0.
- The other variables (`results`, `t`, and `test_cases`) do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `_` is now 0, while `results`, `t`, and `test_cases` remain as given.
