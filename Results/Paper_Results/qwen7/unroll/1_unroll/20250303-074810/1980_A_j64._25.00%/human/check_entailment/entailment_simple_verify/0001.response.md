### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly accepts the number of test cases (`t`) and a list of test cases (`test_cases`), where each test case is a tuple containing `n`, `m`, and a string `a`.
   - The function iterates over each test case, correctly unpacking `n`, `m`, and `a`.

2. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The frequency array `freq` is initialized to zero for each difficulty level ('A' to 'G').
   - The loop correctly increments the count for each difficulty level present in the string `a`.

3. **Missing Problems Calculation**:
   - The expression `sum(max(0, m - f) for f in freq)` correctly calculates the number of missing problems for each difficulty level.
     - If the current frequency `f` is less than `m`, the difference `m - f` is added to the sum.
     - If the current frequency `f` is greater than or equal to `m`, no problems are needed for that difficulty level.
   - This ensures that the total number of missing problems is calculated accurately.

4. **Result Collection and Return**:
   - The results are collected in a list and returned by the function.
   - The main part of the program correctly calls `func_1` with predefined `test_cases` and prints the results.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases match the expected output, confirming that the logic works as intended.

Given the detailed analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
