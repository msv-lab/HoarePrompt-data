Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` correctly computes the prefix balance for each character in the input string `s`.
2. It then sorts the characters based on their prefix balance and index in ascending order of balance and descending order of index.
3. Finally, it constructs the resulting balanced shuffle string by concatenating the characters from the sorted list.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the function appears to follow the steps outlined for the balanced shuffle operation. There are no apparent logical errors or omissions in the code.

Correctness: **True**
