Output State: **The program returns the string `result` which is obtained by joining the third element of each tuple in the sorted `prefix_balance` list.**

This means that the program returns a string constructed by concatenating the third elements of each tuple in the `prefix_balance` list, which is already sorted by the first element (current balance) and then by the negative of the second element (index `i`).
