Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `prefix_balance` is a list of tuples sorted by the first element (current balance) and then by the negative of the second element (index `i`), `balance` is 0.**

The code sorts the `prefix_balance` list based on the current balance in ascending order and, for tuples with the same balance, by the negative of the index in descending order. The original values of `s`, `n`, and `balance` remain unchanged.
