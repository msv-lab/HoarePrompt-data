### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Processing Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the value `m`, the array `a`, and the string `s`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is intended to process the commands and compute the required remainders.
   - The logic to handle the commands 'L' and 'R' is incorrect in the original assessment. The function currently appends elements from the array `a` to the list `b` based on the command, but this does not align with the problem statement. According to the problem, the product of the array elements should be computed before each command is processed, and the element should be removed after computing the product.
   - The variable `p` in `func_1` is used to store the product of the remaining elements of the array `a` after each command is processed. This is correct.
   - However, the loop in `func_1` iterates over the list `b` in reverse, which is unnecessary and incorrect because `b` is built by appending elements from `a` based on the commands, not by the remaining elements after each command.
   - The final result should be returned in the correct order, but the current implementation returns the results in reverse order.

3. **Correct Implementation:**
   - The annotated code shows that the function `func_1` builds the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the commands 'L' and 'R'. This is not aligned with the problem statement, as the product should be computed before removing elements.
   - The product `p` is calculated correctly, but the list `b` is built incorrectly. Instead, the product should be computed directly from the array `a` without building an intermediate list `b`.

4. **Corrected Approach:**
   - The correct approach would be to iterate through the array `a` and compute the product of the remaining elements after each command is processed.
   - After processing each command, the corresponding element should be removed from the array, and the product should be updated accordingly.
   - The results should be stored in a list and returned in the correct order.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic as described in the problem statement. The annotated code further confirms this by showing that the list `b` is built incorrectly, and the product is not computed before removing elements.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final:
**False**
