Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Two counters `cut0` and `cut1` are initialized to zero. These counters will be used to count the number of times a '0' is followed by a '1' and vice versa.

3. **Counting Cuts:**
   - The program iterates through the string `a` from the start to the second last character.
   - If a '1' is followed by a '0', it increments `cut1`.
   - If a '0' is followed by a '1', it increments `cut0`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Number of Pieces:**
   - After counting the cuts, the program checks if `cut0` is zero.
     - If `cut0` is zero, it means there are no '0's followed by '1's, so the string is already sorted. Therefore, the minimum number of pieces required is `cut1 + 1`.
     - If `cut0` is not zero, it means there are '0's followed by '1's, and the minimum number of pieces required is `cut0 + cut1`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Logic for Counting Cuts:**
   - The logic for counting cuts is flawed. The program counts both '10' and '01' transitions but does not correctly handle the requirement to minimize the number of pieces.
   - The program should focus on finding the points where the transition from '0' to '1' happens, as this is the critical point for determining the minimum number of pieces.

2. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the first occurrence of '1' and the last occurrence of '0'. The number of pieces required will be the position of the first '1' plus one (if there is at least one '1') or just 1 if there are no '1's.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = input()
        # Find the first occurrence of '1'
        first_one = a.find('1')
        # Find the last occurrence of '0'
        last_zero = a.rfind('0')
        
        if first_one == -1:  # No '1' found, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        elif last_zero == -1:  # No '0' found, the string is already sorted
            print(1)
        else:
            # The number of pieces is the index of the first '1' plus one
            print(first_one + 1)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has a logical flaw in how it counts and processes the cuts. The corrected approach focuses on finding the critical points ('0' to '1' transition) and calculates the minimum number of pieces accordingly.

**Correctness: False**
