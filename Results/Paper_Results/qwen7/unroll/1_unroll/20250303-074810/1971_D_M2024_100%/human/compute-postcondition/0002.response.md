Output State: The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive. For each input string `a`, the variable `cut0` counts the number of transitions from '0' to '1', and `cut1` counts the number of transitions from '1' to '0'. If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', the output is `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, the output is `cut0 + cut1`.
