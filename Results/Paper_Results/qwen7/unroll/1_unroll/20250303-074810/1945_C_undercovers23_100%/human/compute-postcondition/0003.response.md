Output State: t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. After executing the loop, final is a list containing the index closest to half the length of the string (n/2) where the percentage of zeros and ones in the substring up to that index is at least 50%. If no such index exists, final contains either 0 or n based on whether the overall percentage of '1's is at least 50% or not.
