You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

Rearrange the characters of s to form a new string r that is not equal to s ,
or report that it's impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string s of length at most 10
consisting of lowercase English letters.

Output

For each test case, if no such string r exists as described in the statement,
output "NO" (without quotes).

Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line — the string r
, consisting of letters of string s .

You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

Example

Input

    8
    
    codeforces
    
    aaaaa
    
    xxxxy
    
    co
    
    d
    
    nutdealer
    
    mwistht
    
    hhhhhhhhhh

Output

    YES
    forcodesec
    NO
    YES
    xxyxx
    YES
    oc
    NO
    YES
    undertale
    YES
    thtsiwm
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, another possible answer is \texttt{forcescode} .

In the second test case, all rearrangements of \texttt{aaaaa} are equal to
\texttt{aaaaa} .

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        s = input()
        a = set(s)
        if len(a) == 2:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
            b = ''.join(sorted(s))
            c = ''.join(sorted(s, reverse=True))
            if b == s:
                print(c)
            else:
                print(b)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and a string `s` (consisting of lowercase English letters with a length of at most 10). For each test case, it checks if the number of unique characters in `s` is exactly 2. If true, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then outputs either the lexicographically sorted string or its reverse, depending on which comes first alphabetically.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not generate a valid rearrangement of the string `s` that is different from `s` itself. Instead, it checks if the string has exactly two unique characters. If so, it outputs "NO", which is correct according to the problem statement. However, for strings with more than two unique characters, it incorrectly always outputs "YES" followed by the sorted version of the string in both ascending and descending order. This does not necessarily produce a different string from the original `s`.

For example, consider the input "co":
- The program will output "YES" and then "oc".
- This is correct because "oc" is a valid rearrangement of "co" and is different from "co".

However, consider the input "aaa":
- The program will output "NO".
- This is also correct according to the problem statement because all rearrangements of "aaa" are equal to "aaa".

But consider the input "abc":
- The program will output "YES" and then "abc".
- This is incorrect because "abc" is already the sorted version of itself, and no other rearrangement of "abc" is different from "abc".

Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for strings with more than two unique characters, making it incorrect.
