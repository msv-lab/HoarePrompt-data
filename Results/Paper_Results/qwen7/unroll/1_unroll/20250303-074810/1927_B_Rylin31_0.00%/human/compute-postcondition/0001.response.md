Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, ans is a list of characters formed by mapping the reversed count of each element in the reversed array to the alphabet list, and the result is printed as a string.
