Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Reverse Array Usage**: The `rev_array` is reversed, and then used to count occurrences in the original `array`. This does not correctly map the indices as required by the problem statement.
2. **Incorrect Mapping Logic**: The logic to map the counts to characters is flawed. Specifically, the line `ans.append(alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1])` is incorrect because it uses the reversed array and subtracts one, which does not align with the problem's requirement.
3. **Character Selection**: The character selection logic needs to be corrected to ensure that the correct character is chosen based on the counts of previous occurrences.

### Corrected Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        last_occurrence = [-1] * 26  # Track the last occurrence index of each character
        result = []

        for i in range(n):
            if array[i] == 0:
                result.append('a')  # If no previous occurrence, use 'a'
            else:
                char_index = last_occurrence[ord(result[array[i] - 1]) - ord('a')]
                result.append(chr(char_index + ord('a')) if char_index != -1 else 'a')

            # Update the last occurrence of the current character
            last_occurrence[ord(result[-1]) - ord('a')] = i

        print(''.join(result))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `last_occurrence` to keep track of the last occurrence index of each character.
2. **Processing Each Character**: For each position `i` in the array:
   - If `array[i]` is 0, we append 'a' to the result since there are no previous occurrences.
   - Otherwise, we determine the character to append by looking at the last occurrence of the character that was present `array[i]` positions before.
3. **Updating Last Occurrence**: We update the `last_occurrence` for the current character after appending it to the result.

This approach ensures that the generated string matches the given trace.
