Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets are subsequences of the given string `s`. If not, it should print "NO" and a counterexample string of length `n`.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m`, and the string `s`.
   - It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track the characters seen so far in the string `s`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates the bitmask accordingly.
   - If the bitmask `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` characters have been seen at least once, and it increments the count `cnt`.
   - If `cnt` reaches `n`, it prints "YES".
   - If `cnt` does not reach `n`, it prints "NO" and constructs a string `ans` that includes the missing character and additional 'a's to make it of length `n`.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles the case where `cnt < n` correctly by constructing a string `ans` that includes the missing character and additional 'a's.
   - The logic for constructing `ans` when `cnt < n` is sound and ensures that the output meets the requirements of the problem statement.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints "YES" or "NO" followed by the constructed string `ans` if applicable, which matches the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
