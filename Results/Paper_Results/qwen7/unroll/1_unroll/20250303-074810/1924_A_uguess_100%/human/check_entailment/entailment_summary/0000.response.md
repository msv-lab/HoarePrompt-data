Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` and the string `s`.
3. It uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets have been seen so far in the string `s`.
4. It iterates through the string `s` and updates the bitmask accordingly.
5. When the bitmask equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` alphabets have been seen, and it increments the count `cnt`.
6. After processing the entire string `s`, it checks if `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`. If so, it prints 'YES'.
7. If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints 'NO' and constructs a string `ans` that starts with the missing character and is followed by 'a' repeated `n - cnt - 1` times.

However, there are a few issues with the program:
- The program constructs `ans` by appending characters directly to it, but it should only print the result when necessary.
- The logic to construct `ans` is flawed because it doesn't ensure that the constructed string is of length `n`.

Given these points, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
