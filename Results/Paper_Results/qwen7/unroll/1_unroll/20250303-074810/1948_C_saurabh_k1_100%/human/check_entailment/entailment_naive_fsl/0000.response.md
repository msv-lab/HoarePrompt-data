Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program checks only certain conditions (i.e., when the current column index `i` is odd and the next or previous column's arrow direction matches the current row's arrow direction) and prints 'No' immediately upon finding such a condition. However, this approach is insufficient because the robot can still potentially reach the cell (2, n) even if such conditions are not met.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
6
<>><>>
><<>>
```

In this case, the robot can follow the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6).

The program would incorrectly print 'No' for this case because it only checks the specified conditions and does not account for the possibility of the robot reaching the target cell through other valid paths. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case.
