The function processes `t` test cases, where each test case includes an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even) and a 2xn grid with arrows pointing either left (<) or right (>). For each test case, it checks if there are any invalid configurations (where two consecutive left-pointing arrows face each other directly) in the grid. If such configurations are found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.
