Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5 and `n` is even; the input consists of `t` test cases, each test case includes the dimensions of a 2x `n` grid with arrows pointing either left (<) or right (>). `t` is an input integer.**

In this step, the code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This means `t` now holds the value entered by the user, which is an integer within the specified range. The precondition for `n` and the structure of the test cases remain unchanged.
