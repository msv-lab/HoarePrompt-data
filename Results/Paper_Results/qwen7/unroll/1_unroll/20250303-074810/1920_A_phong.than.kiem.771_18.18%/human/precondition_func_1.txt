t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of multiple lines as described in the problem statement. Each test case starts with an integer n, followed by n lines describing the constraints as pairs of integers (a, x) where a is either 1, 2, or 3, and x is an integer between 1 and 10^9.
