Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string such that `substring` is not empty and appears at least once in `string`, `indices` is a list containing one element which is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.**

The code `index = string.find(substring)` finds the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string` and assigns it to the variable `index`. Since `indices` was initially an empty list, after executing the code, `indices` will contain the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
