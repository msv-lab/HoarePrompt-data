The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `queue` being non-empty. Right before the loop, the `queue` contains `(start, 0)`. This means the `queue` is non-empty and the loop can execute.

No other states need to be adjusted since they do not affect the condition of the `while` loop.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing (start, 0)**
