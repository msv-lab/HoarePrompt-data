#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed. The tree has exactly two leaves, and n satisfies 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and the corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The `n` and `start` variables retain their initial values, with `n` being the number of nodes in the tree and `start` being the initial node where the stone is placed.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 1 or dist2 % 2 == 1) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of nodes in the tree), `edges` (representing the tree's edges), and `start` (the initial node where the stone is placed). It constructs the tree structure, identifies the two leaves, calculates the shortest distances from the start node to each leaf using BFS, and checks if either distance is odd. If an odd distance is found, it returns 'Ron'; otherwise, it returns 'Hermione'.
