Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and pairs of non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operations and returns results based on the input values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for `t` and pairs of values for `x` and `y`. The exact operations performed on these values are not specified, but the function will process each test case and return a result accordingly.
