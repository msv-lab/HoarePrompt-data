Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \) and pairs of non-negative integers \( x \) and \( y \). For each test case, it calculates a value \( z \) based on the formula \((y + 1) // 2\) and adjusts it if another condition is met. After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \( z \) for each case.**
