Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing the number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons, respectively.

2. **Calculation of Minimum Screens:**
   - The variable `z` is calculated as `(y + 1) // 2`. This calculation is intended to determine the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the available space, considering each 2x2 icon takes up 2 cells vertically.
   - The variable `m` is calculated as `15 * z - y * 4`. This formula seems to be attempting to calculate the remaining space after placing all 2x2 icons, but it doesn't seem to correctly account for the space taken by 1x1 icons.
   - The condition `if m < a:` checks if there is enough space left for the 1x1 icons. However, this condition does not make sense because `a` is the number of test cases, not the space available on the screen.
   - The final value of `z` is updated using the formula `z = z + (x - m + 15 - 1) // 15`. This formula attempts to calculate the additional screens needed for the 1x1 icons, but it is incorrectly formulated and does not account for the actual space available on the screen.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `z`, which is supposed to be the minimum number of screens needed.

### Issues Identified:
- The calculation of `m` is incorrect and does not properly account for the space taken by the 2x2 icons.
- The condition `if m < a:` is irrelevant and does not help in determining the correct number of screens.
- The final update of `z` is incorrect and does not reflect the actual space available on the screen.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the total space required for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons and then determine the minimum number of screens needed. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the space required for 2x2 icons
        space_for_2x2 = y * 4
        # Calculate the space required for 1x1 icons
        space_for_1x1 = x
        # Total space required
        total_space_required = space_for_2x2 + space_for_1x1
        # Each screen can hold 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns)
        min_screens_needed = (total_space_required + 14) // 15  # Ceiling division
        print(min_screens_needed)
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed calculations and logic. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
