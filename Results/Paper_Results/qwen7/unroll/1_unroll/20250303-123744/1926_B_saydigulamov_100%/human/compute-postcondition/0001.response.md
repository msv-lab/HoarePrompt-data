Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `a` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `a` is a positive integer. If `a` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since the loop depends on the value of `a`, we need to ensure that `a` is a positive integer. The value of `t` does not affect the loop's execution, so it does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `a` must be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` must be a positive integer**
