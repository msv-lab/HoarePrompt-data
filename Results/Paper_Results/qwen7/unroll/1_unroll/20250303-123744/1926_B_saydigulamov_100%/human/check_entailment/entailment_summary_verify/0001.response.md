### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input.
   - This part of the program is correct and aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Ones**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of ones in each row.
   - This is necessary to identify the shape, but the counting alone is not sufficient. The counting needs to be interpreted in the context of the shape definitions.

3. **Shape Identification**:
   - The current logic to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle is indeed flawed. The provided logic only checks if the first two rows have the same number of ones, which is not sufficient.
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of ones, spaced equally from the left edge.
   - For a triangle, the counts of ones should follow a specific pattern (2*i-1 for the i-th row).

4. **Current Logic Flaws**:
   - The program incorrectly identifies squares and triangles based on the first two rows having the same number of ones. This is not a reliable method.
   - For example, consider a grid that forms a triangle but the first two rows do not have the same number of ones. The program would incorrectly identify it as a triangle.

5. **Function Summary Analysis**:
   - The function summary states that the program checks if the first two rows have the same number of ones and prints "SQUARE" if they do, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise.
   - This summary is accurate but does not reflect the actual complexity required to correctly identify the shapes.

6. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the shapes, the program needs to:
     - Check the pattern of ones in each row to see if it matches the pattern of a square or a triangle.
     - For a square, all rows should have the same number of ones, spaced equally from the left edge.
     - For a triangle, the counts of ones should follow the pattern 1, 3, 5, ..., 2*k-1 for the i-th row.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly identify the shapes based on the problem description. The logic used to determine the shape is insufficient and can lead to incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
