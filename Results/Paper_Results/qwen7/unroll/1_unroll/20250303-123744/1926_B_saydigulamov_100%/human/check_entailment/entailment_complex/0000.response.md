Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` attempts to determine whether the grid contains a square or a triangle based on the distribution of '1's in the first two rows. However, this approach is flawed because it only considers the first two rows and does not account for the entire structure of the grid.

To correctly identify a square or a triangle, the function should:
1. Check if the grid can form a square by verifying if the number of '1's in each row is consistent with a square pattern.
2. Check if the grid can form a triangle by verifying if the number of '1's in each row matches the pattern of a triangle.

The current implementation only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is insufficient to determine the shape of the entire grid. Therefore, the provided function will not work correctly for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
