### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The problem involves identifying whether a given grid contains a triangle or a square made up of '1's.
   - A triangle can be either upright or upside-down, while a square must have its '1's equally spaced from the left edge.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the grid and then reads `n` lines of the grid.
   - It checks if there are any '1's in each row and appends the count of '1's in each row to the list `k`.
   - If the first two counts in `k` are the same, it prints 'SQUARE'. Otherwise, it prints 'TRIANGLE'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for checking a square is correct because a square should have the same number of '1's in each row.
   - However, the logic for checking a triangle is incorrect. The program does not check if the pattern of '1's matches the structure of a triangle. Instead, it only compares the count of '1's in the first two rows, which is insufficient for determining a triangle.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider a grid that forms a triangle but the program incorrectly identifies it as a square:
     ```
     3
     000
     011
     011
     ```
   - The program will count 2 '1's in the second and third rows, so it will print 'SQUARE', which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify triangular shapes. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: False**
