Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still an integer within the range 1 to 100. The output state includes both the updated variable `a` and the unchanged variable `t`.
