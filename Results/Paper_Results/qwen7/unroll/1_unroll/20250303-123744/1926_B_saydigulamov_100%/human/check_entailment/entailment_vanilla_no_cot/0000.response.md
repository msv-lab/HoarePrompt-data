Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Triangle Identification**: 
   - A triangle is defined by having `2*i - 1` consecutive `1`s in the `i-th` row, centered in one column.
   - The program checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows is the same (`if k[0] == k[1]`). This is incorrect because it does not check the pattern of `1`s across rows to confirm a triangular shape.

2. **Square Identification**:
   - A square is defined by having `k` consecutive `1`s in each row, positioned at an equal distance from the left edge.
   - The program only checks if the counts of `1`s in the first two rows are the same, which is insufficient to determine if the entire grid forms a square.

To fix this, the program should:
- Check the pattern of `1`s in each row to see if they match the definition of a triangle or a square.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for triangle
        def is_triangle(grid):
            for i in range(1, n):
                if len(grid[i]) != 2 * i + 1:
                    return False
                if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
                    return False
                mid_index = len(grid[i]) // 2
                if grid[i][mid_index] != '1':
                    return False
                for j in range(mid_index):
                    if grid[i][j] != '1' or grid[i][mid_index - j - 1] != '1':
                        return False
            return True
        
        # Check for square
        def is_square(grid):
            k = None
            for i in range(n):
                if '1' in grid[i]:
                    if k is None:
                        k = grid[i].count('1')
                    elif grid[i].count('1') != k:
                        return False
            return k > 1
        
        if is_triangle(grid):
            print('TRIANGLE')
        elif is_square(grid):
            print('SQUARE')
        else:
            print('NO SHAPE')

```

This corrected function properly checks the patterns of `1`s to identify whether the shape is a triangle or a square.
