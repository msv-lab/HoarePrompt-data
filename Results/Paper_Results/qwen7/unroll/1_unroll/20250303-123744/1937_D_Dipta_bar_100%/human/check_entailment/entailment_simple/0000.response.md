### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid (`n`) and the string `s` representing the grid.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to process the string `s` and compute certain values based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters.
   - `A` and `idx_A` are used to store the cumulative sum of positions of `>` characters and their indices, respectively.
   - `B` and `idx_B` are similarly used for the positions of `<` characters.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The logic for calculating the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid is complex but seems to involve the cumulative sums of positions of `>` and `<` characters.
   - The program iterates through the string `s` twice (once from left to right and once from right to left) to compute these values.
   - The final part of the function uses these precomputed values to determine the time taken for a pinball starting at each position `i` to leave the grid.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when there are no `>` or `<` characters, or when the pinball starts at the boundary of the grid.

5. **Output**:
   - The program prints the time taken for a pinball to leave the grid for each position `i` in the string `s`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_1` seems to correctly implement the rules for the pinball's movement and the calculation of the time taken to leave the grid.
- The double iteration (left-to-right and right-to-left) ensures that all possible paths of the pinball are considered.
- The use of cumulative sums helps in efficiently computing the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.

### Conclusion:
Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
