Output State: **`l` is 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` remains the same list of integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions '>' encountered up to that point, adjusted by the number of previous '>' positions and their indices, `idx_A` remains the same list of indices where the character '>' appears in the string `s`, `B` is a list of integers where each element is calculated based on the positions of '<' relative to the last '>' found, and `idx_B` is a list of indices where the character '<' appears in the string `s`.**

Explanation: The code `l = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `l`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, `idx_A`, `B`, or `idx_B`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
