Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `A` is a list of integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of positions '>' encountered up to that point, adjusted by the number of previous '>' positions and their indices, `idx_A` is a list of indices where the character '>' appears in the string `s`, `B` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `B`. This does not affect the values of `s`, `A`, or `idx_A`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
