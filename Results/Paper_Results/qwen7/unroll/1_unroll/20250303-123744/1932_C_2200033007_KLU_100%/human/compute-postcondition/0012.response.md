Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: n (a positive integer), m (a positive integer), a (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive), and s (a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'). It returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element in 'ans' is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.**
