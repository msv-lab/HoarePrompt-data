### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the program and compare its behavior with the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description:
- For each command, the program should:
  1. Output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array `a` when divided by `m`.
  2. Remove the leftmost element if the command is 'L', or the rightmost element if the command is 'R'.
  3. Repeat until the array is empty.

#### Function Summary:
- The function `func_1` constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`.
- It then calculates a list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`.
- Finally, it returns the reversed version of `ans`.

#### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
   a = list(map(int, input().split()))
   s = input()
   ```
   This part reads the input correctly.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   ```python
   def func_1(n, m, a, s):
       b = []
       l = 0
       r = n - 1
       for i in range(n):
           if s[i] == 'L':
               b.append(a[l])
               l += 1
           else:
               b.append(a[r])
               r -= 1
       ans = []
       p = 1
       for v in reversed(b):
           p = p * v % m
           ans.append(p)
       return reversed(ans)
   ```

   - The function constructs a list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`.
   - It then calculates the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m` and stores the results in `ans`.
   - Finally, it returns the reversed version of `ans`.

3. **Main Loop**:
   ```python
   print(*func_1(n, m, a, s))
   ```

   This part calls the function `func_1` and prints the result.

#### Correctness Check:
- The function `func_1` correctly constructs the list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`.
- The product calculation is done in reverse order, but the key point is that it calculates the product of the remaining elements after each removal, which aligns with the problem description.
- The modulo operation is applied correctly at each step.

Given the problem description and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic described. The main issue highlighted in the original assessment was the incorrect handling of the product calculation, but the code actually performs the product calculation correctly by maintaining the state of the array `a` and calculating the product of the remaining elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the function summary.
