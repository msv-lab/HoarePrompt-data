You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, and s is a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. After the loop executes all the iterations, `b` contains elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented.

    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The given program correctly processes the test cases as described in the problem statement.
2. It reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the value `m`.
3. It then reads the array `a` and the string `s` containing the commands.
4. The function `func_1` is supposed to handle the processing of the commands and calculate the required remainders.
5. In `func_1`, it initializes two pointers `l` and `r` to track the left and right boundaries of the array `a`.
6. For each command in `s`, it appends the appropriate element from the array to a temporary list `b`. However, this part seems to have a mistake because the original problem requires removing elements, not appending them. This should be fixed to directly compute the product and append the result to `ans` without maintaining an intermediate list `b`.
7. After processing all commands, it calculates the product of the remaining elements in the array and takes the modulus with `m` for each step, appending the result to `ans`.
8. Finally, it returns the reversed `ans` which is correct since the operations are processed from the start to the end of the string `s`.

However, there is a logical error in the implementation. The function `func_1` should directly compute the product and append the result to `ans` without maintaining an intermediate list `b`. The current implementation mistakenly appends elements to `b` instead of computing the product.

Corrected Implementation:
```python
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for i in range(n):
        p = (p * a[i]) % m
        ans.append(p)
        if s[i] == 'L':
            a.pop(0)
        else:
            a.pop()
    return ans
```

Given the above reasoning, the original implementation has a logical error but can be corrected easily. Since the core logic and flow of the program align with the problem statement, the overall structure is correct with a minor fix.

Correctness: **False**
