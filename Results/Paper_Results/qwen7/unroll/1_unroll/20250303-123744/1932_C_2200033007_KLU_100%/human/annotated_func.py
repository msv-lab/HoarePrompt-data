#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, a is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, and s is a string consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.
def func_1(n, m, a, s):
    b = []
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'L':
            b.append(a[l])
            l += 1
        else:
            b.append(a[r])
            r -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`. After the loop executes all the iterations, `b` contains elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. If `s[i]` is 'L', the element at index `l` in `a` is appended to `b` and `l` is incremented. If `s[i]` is 'R', the element at index `r` in `a` is appended to `b` and `r` is decremented.
    ans = []
    p = 1
    for v in reversed(b):
        p = p * v % m
        
        ans.append(p)
        
    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^4 for each element a_i in the list, `s` is a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R', `b` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`, `ans` is a list of integers where each element is the result of the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`, `p` is 1.
    return reversed(ans)
    #The program returns a list of integers which is the reversed version of 'ans', where each element is the result of the product of all elements in 'b' (in reverse order) modulo 'm'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts four parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer), `a` (a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 10^4 inclusive), and `s` (a string consisting of `n` characters 'L' and 'R'). It constructs a new list `b` by appending elements from `a` based on the direction specified by `s`. Then, it calculates a list `ans` where each element is the product of all elements in `b` (in reverse order) modulo `m`. Finally, it returns the reversed version of `ans`.
