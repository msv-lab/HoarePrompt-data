Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the range function: `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - The loop variable `i` will take values from 1 to `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 until `i` reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Check the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Identify the Objects in the Loop Head:**
   - The only object in the loop head is `i`, but since `i` is incremented within the loop, we don't need to explicitly adjust its initial value.
   - However, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing, which means `n` must be at least 1.

5. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `i` is incremented within the loop, its initial value is taken care of by the loop itself.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 so that the loop can start executing.

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute. Specifically, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1**
