You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The input consists of n lines, where the j-th character of the i-th line represents the transition video between the i-th and the j-th scenarios. This character can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?' (undecided), or '.' (no transition video needed when i = j). It is guaranteed that at most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided (i.e., at most 2 \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor characters in the input are 'F' or 'S').

The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb` after the if-else block executes.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes an input consisting of n lines, where each line represents transitions between scenarios. Each character in the line indicates the type of transition video ('F' for funny, 'S' for scary, '?' for undecided, or '.' for no transition needed). The function determines the undecided transitions ('?') based on the given constraints and returns the filled matrix of transitions.
