Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate the transition video plan according to the problem description. Specifically, the logic for determining the type of transition videos (funny or scary) for undecided cases (`?`) is flawed. 

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Undecided Cases**: The program attempts to decide the type of transition videos for undecided cases based on whether the indices `i` or `j` belong to the first quarter of the list `sa` or `sb`. However, this logic does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type will occur for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Example Counter-Case**: Consider the following input:
   ```
   5
   .?F??
   ?.???
   F?.S?
   ??S.?
   ????.
   ```

   The program's output is:
   ```
   .FFFF
   F.FFF
   FF.SF
   FFS.F
   FFFF.
   ```

   Let's analyze this output for the permutation `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`:
   - Transition videos: `.FFFF`
   - The sequence of transition videos is `FFFF`, which has 5 consecutive scary videos, which exceeds \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\).

   This violates the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type should occur for any permutation of scenarios.

Given this counter-case, the program does not meet the problem requirements, hence the correctness is **False**.
