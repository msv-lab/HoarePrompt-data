Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.**

The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24, `b` will also be a list of length between 3 and 25, filled with zeros. The initial state of `a` remains unchanged.
