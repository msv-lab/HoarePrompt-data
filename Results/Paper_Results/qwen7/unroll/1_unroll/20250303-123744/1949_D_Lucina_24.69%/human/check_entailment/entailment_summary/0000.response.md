Reasoning:

1. **Input Processing**: The program correctly reads the input and processes it to count the number of 'F' and 'S' transitions for each scenario.
2. **Undecided Transitions Handling**: The program correctly identifies the undecided transitions ('?') and decides whether to set them to 'F' or 'S' based on the counts of 'F' and 'S' transitions already decided.
3. **Decision Logic**: The logic for deciding the type of undecided transitions is sound. If the number of indices with only 'F' transitions is greater than or equal to those with only 'S' transitions, it sets undecided transitions to 'F'; otherwise, it sets them to 'S'. This ensures that the constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type is met.
4. **Output Generation**: The program generates the final matrix of transitions, ensuring that all '?' characters are replaced according to the decision logic and that the original transitions ('F', 'S', '.') are preserved.

Given the problem constraints and the execution summary, the provided program appears to correctly implement the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
