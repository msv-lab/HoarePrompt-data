Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Deciding Transition Types**:
   - The current implementation attempts to decide the types of undecided transitions (`?`) based on whether `i` or `j` belongs to the first quarter of the list `sa` or `sb`. This logic is flawed because it doesn't take into account the global constraint of no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type for any permutation.

2. **Incomplete Handling of Undecided Transitions**:
   - The solution tries to fill in the undecided transitions (`?`) but does so without ensuring the global constraint is met. For example, it might assign `F` or `S` to `?` values without considering the impact on other parts of the sequence.

3. **Missing Consideration of All Permutations**:
   - The problem requires checking all possible permutations of the scenarios to ensure the constraint is met. The current implementation does not perform this check and instead relies on a heuristic that may not guarantee the solution.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm, possibly involving backtracking or dynamic programming, to ensure that the constraints are met for every possible permutation of the scenarios. The provided solution does not achieve this and thus is incorrect.
