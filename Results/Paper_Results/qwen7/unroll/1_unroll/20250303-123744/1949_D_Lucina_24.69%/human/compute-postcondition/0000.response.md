Output State: **`n` is an input integer, and it is such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial condition that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24 remains valid, and the value of `n` is now determined by the user's input.
