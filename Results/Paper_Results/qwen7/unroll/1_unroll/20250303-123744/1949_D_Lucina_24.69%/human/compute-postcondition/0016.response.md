Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable `i` is used in the loop head.
   - The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments by 1 until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` must be set to `1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i <= n + 1`.
   - Since `i` starts at `1`, the loop will execute as long as `i` does not exceed `n + 1`.
   - This means `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1` at the start of the loop.

Given these points, let's adjust the initial state accordingly:

- `i` must be `1` at the start of the loop.
- `n` must be an integer between 2 and 24 (as given in the problem statement).

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: `i` is 1, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24.**
