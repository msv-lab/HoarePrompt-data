Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of 'F' received from the corresponding index in `x`; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of 'S' received from the corresponding index in `x`; `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each string being the result of the inner loop processing based on the rules specified in the loop body; `sa` is a list containing indices `i` where `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0` or `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`; `sb` is a list containing indices `i` where `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`. The length of `sa` is greater than or equal to the length of `sb` after the if-else block executes.**
