Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to complete a matrix representing transition videos between scenarios in a video game such that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type appear, regardless of the order in which the scenarios are played. The matrix is symmetric and initially contains some known values ('F', 'S', or '?').

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code initializes lists `a` and `b` to count the number of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario.
   - It reads the input and populates these counts.
   - It then identifies scenarios that are only 'F' or only 'S'.
   - Depending on whether the number of 'F' scenarios is greater than or equal to the number of 'S' scenarios, it decides how to fill the remaining '?' values.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - If there are more or equal 'F' scenarios, it tries to place 'F' in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) scenarios and 'S' elsewhere.
   - If there are more 'S' scenarios, it places 'S' in the first \(\frac{n}{4}\) scenarios and 'F' elsewhere.

4. **Checking the Implementation**:
   - The logic correctly handles the placement of 'F' and 'S' based on the count of each type.
   - It ensures that the resulting matrix is symmetric.
   - The logic guarantees that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type will appear for any permutation of scenarios.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the code, the program appears to correctly solve the problem. The code ensures that the conditions are met for all permutations of scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
