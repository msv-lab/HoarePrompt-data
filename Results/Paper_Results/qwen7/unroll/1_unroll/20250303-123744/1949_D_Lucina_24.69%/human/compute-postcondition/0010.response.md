Output State: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 24; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of 'F' received from the corresponding index in `x`; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is the count of 'S' received from the corresponding index in `x`; `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each string being the input received in each iteration of the loop; `sa` is a list of indices where 'F' was counted but not 'S' for that index; `sb` is a list of indices where 'S' was counted but not 'F' for that index.
