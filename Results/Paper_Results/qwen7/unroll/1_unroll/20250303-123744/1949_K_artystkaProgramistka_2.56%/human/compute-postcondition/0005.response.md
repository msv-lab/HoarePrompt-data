Output State: `sum_a` is the sum of the first `na` elements in `numbers`, `sum_b` is the sum of the next `nb` elements in `numbers`, `sum_c` is the sum of the last `nc` elements in `numbers`, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `na`, `nb`, and `nc` are integers such that 1 ≤ `na`, `nb`, `nc` ≤ `n`-2 and `na` + `nb` + `nc` = `n`, and `numbers` is a list of `n` positive integers sorted in descending order, and `group_a`, `group_b`, and `group_c` are lists containing the first `na`, next `nb`, and last `nc` elements from `numbers` respectively.
