### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to simulate the process of laying out cards according to specific rules and find the k-th card laid down.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards to be laid down at each step.
   - In the `while` loop, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards up to `n`. This is then subtracted from `n` and appended to `L`.
   - After constructing `L`, it iterates through the list to determine the k-th card laid down.
   - For each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`. If it does, it calculates and prints the corresponding card.
   - It updates `tot` and `pow` accordingly.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating `m` and appending it to `L` correctly identifies the number of odd-numbered cards at each step.
   - The main loop iterates through `L` to find the k-th card, considering the cumulative count `tot` and the current batch size `a`.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card for the current batch.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` might fall outside the current batch size by updating `tot` and continuing to the next batch.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k` is exactly at the boundary of a batch.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all specified cases.
