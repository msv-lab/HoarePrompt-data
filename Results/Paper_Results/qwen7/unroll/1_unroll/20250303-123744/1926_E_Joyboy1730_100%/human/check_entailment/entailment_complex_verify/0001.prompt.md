You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each test case defined by `t`, the loop processes pairs of integers `(n, k)` and prints a result based on the operations performed within the loop. Specifically, it calculates a sequence `L` where each element represents half of the current value of `n` rounded up, subtracts this value from `n`, and appends the result to `L`. Then, it iterates over `L` to find the position where `k` falls within the cumulative sum of elements in `L`, and prints a calculated value based on this position. The output consists of multiple lines, one for each pair `(n, k)` processed, representing the computed results.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, and k. It first checks if t is within the range 1 to 50,000. If valid, it reads t test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a sequence L by repeatedly halving n (rounded up) until n becomes zero. Then, it determines the position where k falls within the cumulative sum of elements in L and computes and prints a specific value based on this position. The function outputs a series of results, one for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires us to simulate the process of laying out cards according to specific rules and find the k-th card laid down.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It initializes an empty list `L` to store the number of cards to be laid down at each step.
   - In the `while` loop, it calculates `m` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the number of odd-numbered cards up to `n`. This is then subtracted from `n` and appended to `L`.
   - After constructing `L`, it iterates through the list to determine the k-th card laid down.
   - For each element `a` in `L`, it checks if `k` falls within the range `[tot, tot + a]`. If it does, it calculates and prints the corresponding card.
   - It updates `tot` and `pow` accordingly.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for calculating `m` and appending it to `L` correctly identifies the number of odd-numbered cards at each step.
   - The main loop iterates through `L` to find the k-th card, considering the cumulative count `tot` and the current batch size `a`.
   - The formula `pow * (2 * (k - tot) - 1)` correctly computes the k-th card for the current batch.
   - The overall structure and logic of the program match the problem's requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k` might fall outside the current batch size by updating `tot` and continuing to the next batch.
   - The program correctly handles the case when `k` is exactly at the boundary of a batch.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required logic and handle all specified cases.
