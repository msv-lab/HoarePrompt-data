Output State: **`t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, `R()` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.**

Explanation: The code `t, = R()` unpacks the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()` into the variable `t`. Since `R()` returns a tuple of integers and we are unpacking it into `t`, `t` will be the first element of that tuple. The lambda function `R()` itself remains unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is now satisfied with the specific value of the first element of the tuple.
