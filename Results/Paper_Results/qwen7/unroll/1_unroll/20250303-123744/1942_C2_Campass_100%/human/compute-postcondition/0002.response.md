Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `while t:`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Understand the Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is truthy (non-zero for integers).

3. **Current State**: Before the loop, `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, where `R()` is a lambda function that takes input and splits it into a tuple of integers.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**: For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (truthy). Since `t` is the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`, we need to ensure that this first element is non-zero.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be non-zero.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be non-zero**
