Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to check if the scores are consistent with the rules of the game. For instance, consider the input `(1, 1, 10)`. According to the problem description, the maximum score a player can achieve is 6 (by winning all games they play), but the program does not enforce this constraint. The program calculates the number of draws based on the total points and the differences in scores, but it does not validate if the scores are achievable under the given rules. This leads to an incorrect output of `2` for the input `(1, 1, 10)`, which is not possible since no player can have a score higher than 6 without violating the game rules.
