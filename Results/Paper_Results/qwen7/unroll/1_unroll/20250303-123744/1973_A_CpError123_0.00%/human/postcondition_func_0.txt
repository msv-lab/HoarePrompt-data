The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and `cas_de_test`, a list of lists where each inner list contains three non-negative integers `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` such that `0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30`. It evaluates each inner list according to specific conditions and returns a list of results. Each result in the returned list is either a non-negative integer representing the number of equal matches or `-1` if the conditions are not met.
