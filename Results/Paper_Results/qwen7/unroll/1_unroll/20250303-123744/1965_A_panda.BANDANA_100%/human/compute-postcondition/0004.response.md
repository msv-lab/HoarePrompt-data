Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns information about the distribution of stones across the piles based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers representing the number of stones in each of `n` piles. The function processes these inputs to provide some form of output regarding the distribution of stones, without specifying the exact nature of the output in the given constraints.
