Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the cost calculation for bribing people in the queue. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Cost Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the minimum cost by iterating from `num_fila - 1` down to `max_p - 1` and then from `max_p - 1` down to `0`. However, the logic for determining whether to add `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]` is flawed. It does not correctly account for the cumulative cost of bribing multiple people.

2. **Edge Cases Not Handled**: The program does not handle edge cases where the optimal strategy involves bribing multiple people in sequence. For example, consider the following input:
   ```
   4 2
   7 3 6 9
   4 3 8 5
   ```
   The correct solution would involve bribing the first person (costing 7 coins) and then the second person (costing 3 coins), resulting in a total cost of 10 coins. However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 14 coins.

3. **Incorrect Logic Flow**: The program's logic flow is not aligned with the problem's requirements. It does not ensure that the minimum cost is achieved by considering all possible sequences of bribes.

To illustrate, let's consider the example provided in the problem statement:
```
4 2
7 3 6 9
4 3 8 5
```
The correct minimum cost should be 10 coins (bribe the first person for 7 coins and the second person for 3 coins). However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 14 coins.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
