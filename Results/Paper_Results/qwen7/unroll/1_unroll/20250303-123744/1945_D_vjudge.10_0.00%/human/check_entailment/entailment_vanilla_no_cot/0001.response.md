### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `x`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`) and the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`max_p`).
   - It also reads the lists `a_values` and `b_values`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost to move Kirill to a position within the allowed range (`max_p`).
   - For each position from `num_fila-1` down to `max_p`, it checks whether moving to that position costs less using `a_values` or `b_values`.
   - This part of the logic seems to be implemented correctly.

3. **Optimization Loop**:
   - The program then optimizes the path by checking if moving one position back would save more coins.
   - It uses a nested loop to check positions from `max_p-1` down to `1`.
   - The logic here is to ensure that the minimum cost is accumulated by considering both `a_values` and `b_values` for each position.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the final position is the first position (`y == 1`), adding the cost of the first position in `a_values` to the total cost.
   - The logic ensures that the cost is minimized by breaking out of the loop once the optimal path is found.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the minimum cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and handles the logic correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program is correct based on the provided problem description.
