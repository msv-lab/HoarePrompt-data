Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `x` is an input integer, `custos` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `custos`. This does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, `t` remains a positive integer within the specified range, and `x` remains an input integer. The new variable `custos` is created and is an empty list.
