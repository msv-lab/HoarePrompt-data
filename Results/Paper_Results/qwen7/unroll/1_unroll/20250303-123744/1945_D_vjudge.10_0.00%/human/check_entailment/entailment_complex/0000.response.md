Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for each test case, including the number of people in the queue (`num_fila`), the maximum allowable final position of Kirill (`max_p`), and the lists `a` and `b`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the cost for each test case by iterating through the list `a` and `b` in reverse order.
   - It checks if the cost of moving Kirill to a position `y` is lower when using `a_values[y]` or `b_values[y]`.
   - The logic for updating the cost `custo` seems to be correct, considering both the direct cost `a_values[y]` and the intermediate costs `b_values[y]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where Kirill moves to the first position by adding `a_values[0]` to the cost if `y == 1`.
   - It also breaks out of the loop early if the cost condition is met, which ensures that the minimum cost is found efficiently.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the cumulative cost for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to follow the problem description accurately and handles all the necessary calculations and conditions correctly.

Correctness: **True**
