Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to maximize the score according to the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: The list of integers is sorted in ascending order. This ensures that when we pair the smallest elements together, we are maximizing the minimum value in each pair, which is the optimal strategy to maximize the score.
3. **Scoring Calculation**: For each test case, the program sums up every other element starting from the first element of the sorted list. This is equivalent to summing the smaller elements in each pair formed during the game.
4. **Output**: The calculated score is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the explanation above, the program correctly computes the maximum score for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
