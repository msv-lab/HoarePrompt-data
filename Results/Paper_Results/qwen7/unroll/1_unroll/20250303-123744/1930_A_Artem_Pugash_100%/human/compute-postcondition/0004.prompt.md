You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        l = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        
        score = 0
        
        for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2):
            score += l[i]
        
        print(score)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7. After executing the loop, the score is calculated as the sum of the first and third, fifth, etc., elements in the sorted list l for each test case, and printed for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases where each case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and arrays of positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
