Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases where each case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) representing the number of test cases, followed by integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and arrays of positive integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). For each test case, it returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and arrays of numbers, and it processes these inputs to produce a result for each test case without needing to be explicitly called with parameters within its definition.
