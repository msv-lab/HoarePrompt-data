### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that the score is incremented by \(\min(x, y)\) and the selected integers are removed from the list.
   - The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integers because \(\min(x, y)\) will be maximized when both \(x\) and \(y\) are small.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the list of \(2n\) integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (which correspond to the smaller elements in each pair).
   - Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It sorts the list of integers, which is a good step towards ensuring that the smallest elements are paired.
   - However, the code sums the elements at even indices, which means it pairs the smallest elements with the next smallest elements, not necessarily the smallest available elements in each iteration.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The sorting step is correct and ensures that the smallest elements are considered first.
   - However, the summation of elements at even indices does not guarantee that the smallest available elements are paired in each iteration. For example, consider the input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorting gives `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the code will sum `1 + 3 = 4`. But the optimal pairs would be `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`, resulting in a score of `1 + 3 = 4` but also `2 + 4 = 6`, leading to a total score of `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The current implementation might fail for certain edge cases where the optimal pairs are not correctly identified. For example, the input `[1, 2, 3, 4]` should yield a score of `6` (sum of pairs `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`), but the current implementation yields `4`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for maximizing the score. While sorting the list is a good start, the summation of elements at even indices does not ensure that the smallest available elements are paired in each iteration.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
