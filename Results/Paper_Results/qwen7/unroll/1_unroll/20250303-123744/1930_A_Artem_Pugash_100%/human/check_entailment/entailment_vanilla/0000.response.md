### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) such that the score is incremented by \(\min(x, y)\) and the selected integers are removed from the list.
2. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy is to always pair the smallest available integers because \(\min(x, y)\) will be maximized when both \(x\) and \(y\) are small.
3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and the list of \(2n\) integers.
   - It sorts the list of integers.
   - It iterates over the sorted list in steps of 2, summing up the elements at even indices (which correspond to the smaller elements in each pair).
4. **Correctness Check**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that we always pick the smallest available integers.
   - Summing the elements at even indices effectively pairs the smallest elements together.
   - This approach guarantees the maximum possible score because any other pairing would result in a lower score due to the properties of the \(\min\) function.
5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles all given constraints and examples correctly.
   - It works for any number of test cases within the specified limits.
   - It correctly processes the input and outputs the expected results.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the optimal strategy for maximizing the score.
