Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum final score according to the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting**: For each test case, it reads `2n` integers and sorts them in ascending order.
3. **Scoring Logic**: It then iterates through the sorted list in steps of 2, adding the elements at even indices to the score. This ensures that the smallest available numbers are paired together, maximizing the score since \(\min(x, y)\) will always be the smaller of the two numbers.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the score for each test case.

This approach guarantees that the score is maximized because pairing the smallest numbers together in each step ensures that the minimum of each pair is as large as possible. Thus, the program is correct for the given problem.
