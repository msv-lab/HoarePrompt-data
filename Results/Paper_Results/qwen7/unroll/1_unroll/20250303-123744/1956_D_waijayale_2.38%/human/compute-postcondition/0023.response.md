Functionality: **The function `recursive_maximize_sum` takes two parameters, `l` and `r`, which define a sublist of the input list `a`. It modifies the sublist to maximize the sum of its elements under certain conditions. Specifically, if the sum of the sublist is less than or equal to \((r - l + 1)^2\), it sets all elements in the sublist to \(r - l + 1\) and records the operation. Otherwise, it finds the maximum element in the sublist and recursively calls itself on the left and right parts of the sublist excluding the position of the maximum element. The function returns the maximum sum achievable by these operations.**
