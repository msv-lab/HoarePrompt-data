Postcondition: **`a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= n <= 18 and 0 <= a_i <= 10^7; `l` and `r` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= l <= r <= n; `ops` is a list that will store the operations performed; `s` is the sum of elements from index `l` to index `r` (inclusive). If `s` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then for each index i in the range [l-1, r-1], `a[i]` equals `r - l + 1`, and for all other indices, `a[i]` remains unchanged. The value of `s` is `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 2) / 2` if `l <= i <= r`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged. `l` and `r` retain their original values. If `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, then `s` is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, `mx` is the maximum value in the sublist `a[l:r + 1]`, and if `pos` is not equal to `r`, `pos` is incremented by 1 and the function `recursive_maximize_sum(pos + 1, r)` is called.**
