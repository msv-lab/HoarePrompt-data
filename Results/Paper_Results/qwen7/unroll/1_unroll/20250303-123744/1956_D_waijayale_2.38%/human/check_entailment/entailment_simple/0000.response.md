Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array \(a\) by performing operations that set a subarray to the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value of that subarray. The operations can be performed up to \(5 \times 10^5\) times.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1**: This function recursively sets a subarray to the value \(r - l + 1\) if the current value at index \(l\) is not already \(r - l + 1\). It also ensures that the subarray is consistent by setting all elements in the range \([l, r]\) to \(r - l + 1\).
   - **func_2**: This function uses `func_1` to maximize the sum of the array. It calculates the sum of the current subarray and checks if it can be increased by setting the subarray to the next possible value.
   - **func_3**: This function reads the input, calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum and the operations needed, and then prints the results.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly sets the subarray to the appropriate value to maximize the sum.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies when to apply `func_1` to maximize the sum.
   - The overall structure of the program is sound and follows the problem's requirements.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to be correctly designed to solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **True**
