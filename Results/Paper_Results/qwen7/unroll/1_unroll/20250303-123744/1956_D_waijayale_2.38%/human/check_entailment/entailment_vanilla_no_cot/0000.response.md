Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided code has several issues that make it incorrect for solving the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Function Definitions and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but not used properly. It seems intended to update the array to a specific value within a range, but it's not integrated correctly into the main logic.
   - The function `recursive_maximize_sum` is defined but never called within the `func_2` function. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in how the functions should interact.
   - The function `func_2` is defined but not implemented correctly. It calls `recursive_maximize_sum` but doesn't handle the result or pass necessary variables.

2. **Logic Issues**:
   - The logic for maximizing the sum of the array is flawed. The approach taken in `recursive_maximize_sum` does not correctly ensure that the sum is maximized by setting segments of the array to the appropriate values.
   - The MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value calculation and setting is not handled correctly. The function should identify the smallest missing number in the current segment and set all elements in that segment to this value.

3. **Operations Counting**:
   - The operations count (`m`) is not being tracked correctly. The function `func_2` returns `len(ops)` without actually updating `ops` in the context of the problem.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you would need to:
- Identify the smallest missing number (MEX) in each subarray.
- Set all elements in the subarray to this MEX value.
- Ensure the total number of operations does not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the solution:

```python
def mex(arr):
    seen = set(arr)
    i = 0
    while i in seen:
        i += 1
    return i

def maximize_array(a):
    n = len(a)
    ops = []
    for i in range(n):
        l, r = i, n - 1
        while l < r:
            x = mex(a[l:r+1])
            for j in range(l, r + 1):
                a[j] = x
                ops.append((l, r))
            l += 1
            r -= 1
    return sum(a), len(ops), ops

def func_3():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s, m, ops = maximize_array(a)
    print(s, m)
    for (l, r) in ops:
        print(l + 1, r + 1)

func_3()
```

This approach ensures that each segment of the array is set to its MEX value, and the operations are tracked correctly.
