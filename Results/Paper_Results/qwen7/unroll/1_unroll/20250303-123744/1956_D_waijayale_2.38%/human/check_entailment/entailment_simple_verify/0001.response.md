### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Base Case**: When `l == r`, the function checks if `a[l]` is not zero. If it is not zero, it sets `a[l]` to zero and appends `(l, l)` to `ops`. This ensures that the element is set to zero if it is not already zero.
- **Recursive Case**: For `l < r`, the function calls itself recursively for `l + 1` to `r`. After the recursive call, it checks if `a[l]` is not equal to `r - l + 1`. If it is not, it sets all elements from `l` to `r` to `r - l + 1` and appends `(l, r)` to `ops`. Then, it calls itself recursively again for `l + 1` to `r`.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function initializes the operations list `ops` and calls `recursive_maximize_sum(0, n - 1)`. It returns the sum of the array `a`, the number of operations `len(ops)`, and the operations list `ops`.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- **Base Case**: If the sum of the subarray `a[l:r + 1]` is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it calls `func_1` to set all elements to `r - l + 1`. This ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.
- **Recursive Case**: If the sum of the subarray is greater than `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)`, it finds the maximum element in the subarray and calls itself recursively for the left and right parts of the subarray excluding the position of the maximum element.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input values `n` and `a`.
- It calls `func_2` to get the maximum sum, number of operations, and the operations list.
- It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations.
- It then prints each operation in the format `(l + 1, r + 1)`.

### Detailed Analysis

1. **Base Case Handling**: The base case in `func_1` correctly handles the scenario where `l == r` and ensures that the element is set to zero if it is not already zero.
2. **Recursive Operation**: The recursive call in `func_1` ensures that the entire subarray is updated correctly.
3. **Maximization Logic**: In `recursive_maximize_sum`, the logic to check if the sum of the subarray is less than or equal to `(r - l + 1) * (r - l + 1)` and then setting all elements to `r - l + 1` is sound. This ensures that the subarray is filled with the smallest possible value that maximizes the sum.
4. **Finding Maximum Element**: The logic to find the maximum element and then recursively call `recursive_maximize_sum` on the left and right parts is correct. This ensures that the entire array is processed to maximize the sum.
5. **Output Formatting**: The output formatting in `func_3` is correct, ensuring that the operations are printed in the required format.

### Conclusion

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the array by performing the allowed operations. The program adheres to the constraints and the problem description.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the functions.
