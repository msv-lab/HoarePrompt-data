### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` aims to ensure that all elements in the range `[l, r]` are either zero or equal to `r - l + 1`.
- However, the current implementation does not correctly compute the MEX (Minimum EXcluded) value for the subarray and update all elements accordingly.
- The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the subarray already contains all values from 1 to `r - l + 1`, which would mean the MEX is 0.
- The function also does not handle the case where the subarray has missing values, leading to incorrect updates.

#### Function `recursive_maximize_sum`:
- This function attempts to maximize the sum of the subarray `[l, r]` by either setting all elements to `r - l + 1` or recursively processing the left and right parts of the subarray.
- The logic for finding the MEX and updating the array is flawed, as it does not correctly handle the cases where the subarray already contains the required values or where the MEX needs to be recalculated.

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calls `recursive_maximize_sum` and returns the sum of the array, the number of operations, and the operations themselves.
- The overall logic is flawed due to the incorrect handling of the MEX and the updates to the array.

#### Function `func_3`:
- This function reads the input, calls `func_2`, and prints the results.
- Given the flaws in `func_2`, the output will be incorrect.

#### Corrected Version:
- The original assessment suggests a corrected version of `func_1` that correctly computes the MEX and updates the array.
- The corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and applied to the subarray.

Given the analysis, the original program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the array elements. The provided corrections are necessary to ensure the program works as intended.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the MEX calculation and updating the array. The provided corrections are needed to make the program work as expected.
