You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, a, and b. It reads t, then for each of the next t test cases, it reads n, a, and b. Based on the values of a and b, it calculates and prints one of three possible outputs: \(A \times B\), \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\), or \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). After processing all test cases, the function concludes without returning any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when the number of yogurts is odd. Specifically, in the third test case of the example (3 5 11), the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which results in 15 burles. However, the optimal strategy would be to buy two yogurts for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles, resulting in a total cost of 15 burles. 

To fix this, the program should consider the following logic:
- Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible using the promotion price.
- If there is a remaining yogurt, buy it at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly, including when the number of yogurts is odd.
