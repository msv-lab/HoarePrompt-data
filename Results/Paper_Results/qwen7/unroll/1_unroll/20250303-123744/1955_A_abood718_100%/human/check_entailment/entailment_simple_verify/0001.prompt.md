You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (A, B, C) = map(int, input().split())
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, a, and b are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        A, B, C = map(int, input().split())
        
        if B * 2 < C:
            print(A * B)
        elif A % 2 == 0:
            print(int(A * C / 2))
        else:
            X = A // 2
            print(X * C + B)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each representing the result of one iteration of the loop based on the input values for A, B, and C. For each test case (i), if \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\). If \(A\) is even, the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\). Otherwise, the output will be \(\frac{A}{2} \times C + B\). The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input value.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts.
   - The cost can be calculated either at the regular price (`a` per yogurt) or at the promotional price (`b` for two yogurts).

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers: `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It then checks if the promotional price for two yogurts (`b`) is less than twice the regular price (`2*a`).
     - If `2*a > b`, it means it's cheaper to buy each yogurt individually at `a` burles.
     - If `2*a <= b`, it means it's cheaper to use the promotion.
       - If `A` (the number of yogurts) is even, it calculates the total cost as `(A/2) * b`.
       - If `A` is odd, it calculates the cost as `(A//2) * b + a`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the promotional price (`2*a > b`) is correct.
   - The logic for handling even and odd numbers of yogurts is also correct:
     - If `A` is even, buying in pairs is straightforward.
     - If `A` is odd, the program correctly buys as many pairs as possible and then buys the remaining yogurt at the regular price.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when `A` is odd and when the promotional price is better than the individual price.

5. **Output:**
   - The output matches the expected results provided in the example.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for Maxim to buy `n` yogurts under the given conditions.
