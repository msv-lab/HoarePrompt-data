Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of one iteration of the loop based on the values of A, B, and C for each test case. Specifically, for each test case:

- If \(B \times 2 < C\), the output will be \(A \times B\).
- If \(B \times 2 \geq C\) and \(A\) is even, the output will be \(\frac{A \times C}{2}\).
- If \(B \times 2 \geq C\) and \(A\) is odd, the output will be \(\left\lfloor \frac{A}{2} \right\rfloor \times C + B\).

The number of lines in the output will be equal to the number of test cases specified by the first input value \(t\).
