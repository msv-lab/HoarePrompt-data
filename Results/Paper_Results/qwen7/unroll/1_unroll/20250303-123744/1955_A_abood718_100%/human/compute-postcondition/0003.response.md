Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by n, a, and b which are integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). For each test case, the function processes these values and returns different outputs based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific integers, and performs some operations on these integers to produce a result for each test case. However, since the exact operations and return values are not specified, the focus here is on the structure and nature of the inputs and implied processing.
