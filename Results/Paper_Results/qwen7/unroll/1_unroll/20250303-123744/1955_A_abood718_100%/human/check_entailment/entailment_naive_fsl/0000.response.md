Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more advantageous, especially when the number of yogurts is odd. Specifically, in the third test case of the example (3 5 11), the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `int(A * C / 2)`, which results in 15 burles. However, the optimal strategy would be to buy two yogurts for 11 burles and one yogurt for 5 burles, resulting in a total cost of 15 burles. 

To fix this, the program should consider the following logic:
- Calculate the cost of buying as many pairs as possible using the promotion price.
- If there is a remaining yogurt, buy it at the regular price.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        pairs = n // 2
        remaining = n % 2
        cost = pairs * b + remaining * a
        print(cost)
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all cases correctly, including when the number of yogurts is odd.
