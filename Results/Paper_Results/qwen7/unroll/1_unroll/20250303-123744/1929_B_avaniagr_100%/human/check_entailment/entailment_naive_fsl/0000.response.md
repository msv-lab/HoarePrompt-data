Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is exactly `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, for a grid of size \( n \times n \), there are \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals. The program handles cases where `k` is less than or equal to \( 4n - 4 \) and specific cases for `k` being \( 4n - 3 \) and \( 4n - 2 \). However, the program incorrectly prints `2 * n` for `k == 4 * n - 2`, which is not the minimum number of cells needed.

For example, consider the case where \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \). According to the problem, the minimum number of cells needed is 6, but the program prints 6, which is correct. However, for \( n = 3 \) and \( k = 10 \), the program should still print 6, but it incorrectly prints 6 instead of handling it as a special case.

A correct approach would be to handle the case where `k == 4 * n - 2` separately, ensuring that the minimum number of cells needed is calculated correctly.
