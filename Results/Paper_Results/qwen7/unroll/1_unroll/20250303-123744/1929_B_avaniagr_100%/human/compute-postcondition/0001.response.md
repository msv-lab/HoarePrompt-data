Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `2 * n - 1`, or `2 * n`, depending on the value of `k` relative to `4 * n - 4`, `4 * n - 3`, and `4 * n - 2` respectively, for each test case provided in the input.

Each line of output corresponds to one test case, where `n` and `k` are read from the input, and the appropriate value is printed based on the conditions given in the loop.
