Reasoning:
1. The annotated program seems to follow the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The program handles two cases:
   - When `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.
   - When `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

3. For the first case (`k > (n + 1) // 2`):
   - It iteratively calculates the sum of the number of odd multiples up to a certain point (`s`).
   - It then determines the exact position of the `k`-th card by adjusting the position based on the remaining cards (`g` and `f`).
   - Finally, it computes the card number using the formula `2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)`.

4. For the second case (`k <= (n + 1) // 2`):
   - It directly prints `2 * k - 1`, which is the correct formula for the position of the `k`-th card when `k` is within the first half of the sequence.

5. The program correctly resets variables for each test case, ensuring that the state is clean for the next iteration.

Given the logic and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the described algorithm.

Correctness: **True**
