You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * (2 * f - 1)
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9. After all the executions of the loop have finished, the values of n and k from each test case will be processed according to the given conditions, and the result (a single integer value calculated for each test case) will be printed. The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, `g`, and `f` will be reset to their initial values before processing the next test case.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and given integers n and k such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the function returns information based on these inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
