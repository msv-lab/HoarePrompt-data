#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a[j] < 2^{31} for all 0 ≤ j < n.
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[(1 << 31) - 1 ^ num] = count.get((1 << 31) - 1 ^ num, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
            if count[num] == 0:
                del count[num]
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the number of unique elements in the list `a`, `n` is the original number of elements in the list `a`, `a` is the original list of non-negative integers, and `count` is an empty dictionary.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in the list 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers. It returns the number of unique elements in the list `a`. The function iterates through the list `a`, using a dictionary `count` to track occurrences of each element after applying a bitwise operation. If an element appears for the first time, it increments the result counter `res`. If an element has been seen before, it decrements its count in `count`; if its count reaches zero, it removes it from `count`. After processing all elements, the function returns the value of `res`, which represents the number of unique elements in the list `a`.
