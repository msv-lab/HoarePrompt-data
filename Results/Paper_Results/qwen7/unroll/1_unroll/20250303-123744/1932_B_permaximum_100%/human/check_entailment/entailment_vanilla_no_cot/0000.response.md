Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program is almost correct but has a logical error in the calculation of `next_year`. Specifically, the logic to find the next occurrence of the sign should be more precise. The current implementation does not correctly handle the scenario where the current year is not a multiple of `ai`, leading to incorrect results.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input().strip())
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    test_cases.append((n, a))
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test in test_cases:
        (n, a) = test
        current_year = 0
        for ai in a:
            next_year = current_year + ai
            while next_year % ai != 0:
                next_year += 1
            current_year = next_year
        results.append(current_year)
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Correction:
- **Finding the Next Year:** Instead of trying to calculate the next year directly, we incrementally find the next year where the current year plus the periodicity `ai` is a multiple of `ai`.
- **Loop Until Correct Year:** The loop continues until `next_year` is a multiple of `ai`, ensuring that the next occurrence of the sign is correctly calculated.
- **Update Current Year:** After finding the correct next year, update `current_year` to this value before moving to the next sign.

This approach ensures that the program correctly calculates the year when all signs will occur sequentially.
