### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` step-by-step to verify the correctness of the implementation.

1. **Input Parsing and Test Case Structure**:
   - The program correctly parses the input and stores each test case in the `test_cases` list. Each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates over each test case and initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each sign in the list `a`, it calculates the next year in which the sign will occur.
   - The logic to find the next year is:
     - If `current_year % ai == 0`, then the next year is `current_year + ai`.
     - Otherwise, the next year is `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - Let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       3
       2 3 6
       ```
     - Expected Output: 12
     - Explanation:
       - First sign occurs every 2 years: Years 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ...
       - Second sign occurs every 3 years: Years 3, 6, 9, 12, ...
       - Third sign occurs every 6 years: Years 6, 12, 18, ...
       - The first sign occurs in year 2, so the tribe waits for the second sign starting from year 3. The second sign will occur in year 6, so the tribe waits for the third sign starting from year 7. The third sign will occur in year 12, so the output should be 12.

   - Now let's trace the logic in the program:
     - For the first sign (every 2 years), the program correctly identifies the first occurrence at year 2.
     - For the second sign (every 3 years), the program correctly identifies the next occurrence after year 2 as year 6.
     - For the third sign (every 6 years), the program correctly identifies the next occurrence after year 6 as year 12.

4. **Verification with Another Example**:
   - Consider another example:
     - Input:
       ```
       1
       3
       1 2 3
       ```
     - Expected Output: 6
     - Explanation:
       - First sign occurs every 1 year: Years 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...
       - Second sign occurs every 2 years: Years 2, 4, 6, ...
       - Third sign occurs every 3 years: Years 3, 6, 9, ...
       - The first sign occurs in year 1, so the tribe waits for the second sign starting from year 2. The second sign will occur in year 4, so the tribe waits for the third sign starting from year 5. The third sign will occur in year 6, so the output should be 6.

   - Tracing the logic in the program:
     - For the first sign (every 1 year), the program correctly identifies the first occurrence at year 1.
     - For the second sign (every 2 years), the program correctly identifies the next occurrence after year 1 as year 4.
     - For the third sign (every 3 years), the program correctly identifies the next occurrence after year 4 as year 6.

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which all signs will occur sequentially. The original assessment was incorrect because the provided logic in the function `func_1` is actually correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**
