Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains three variables: `test`, `test_cases`, and implicitly the loop control variable `test`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Each Variable**:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions.
   - `results` is an empty list.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in `test_cases`.
   - The loop control variable `test` will take each element from `test_cases` one by one.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop will execute based on the elements in `test_cases`, `test_cases` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The loop control variable `test` will be set to the first element of `test_cases` when the loop starts.

Given these points, we can conclude that the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `test_cases` must have at least one element.
- `test` will be set to the first element of `test_cases`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must have at least one element, `results` is an empty list, `test` is the first element of `test_cases`**.
