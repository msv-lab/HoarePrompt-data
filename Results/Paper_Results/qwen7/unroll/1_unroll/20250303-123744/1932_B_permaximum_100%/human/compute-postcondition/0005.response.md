Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 1 and 100) and a list of `n` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). The function returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the final value of `current_year` after executing an inner loop for each test case.**
