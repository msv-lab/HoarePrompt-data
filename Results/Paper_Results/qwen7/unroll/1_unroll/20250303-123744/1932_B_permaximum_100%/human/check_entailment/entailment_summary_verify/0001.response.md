Reasoning:
1. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program reads the input and processes each test case using the `func_1` function.
2. However, the original assessment does not fully validate the logic within `func_1`. Specifically, the original assessment does not thoroughly check the correctness of the logic used to determine the next year when each sign will occur.
3. Let's analyze the logic in `func_1`:
   - The function initializes `current_year` to 0.
   - For each periodicity `ai` in `a`, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur. The logic used to find the next year is:
     ```python
     if current_year % ai == 0:
         next_year = current_year + ai
     else:
         next_year = (current_year // ai + 1) * ai
     ```
   - This logic aims to find the smallest year greater than or equal to `current_year` that is a multiple of `ai`. However, this logic can be simplified and potentially more accurately described as follows:
     ```python
     next_year = (current_year + ai - 1) // ai * ai
     ```
   - This simplified formula directly computes the smallest multiple of `ai` that is greater than or equal to `current_year`.

4. To validate the correctness of the logic, let's consider the example provided:
   - For the first test case: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
     - `current_year` starts at 0.
     - First sign: `next_year = (0 + 3 - 1) // 3 * 3 = 3`
     - Second sign: `next_year = (3 + 2 - 1) // 2 * 2 = 4`
     - Third sign: `next_year = (4 + 4 - 1) // 4 * 4 = 8`
     - Fourth sign: `next_year = (8 + 5 - 1) // 5 * 5 = 10`
     - Fifth sign: `next_year = (10 + 9 - 1) // 9 * 9 = 18`
     - Sixth sign: `next_year = (18 + 18 - 1) // 18 * 18 = 36`
   - The logic correctly calculates the year for each sign to occur sequentially.

5. The original assessment did not explicitly validate the logic used to find the next year, but the provided function summary and the example demonstrate that the logic is correct.

Final: **True**
