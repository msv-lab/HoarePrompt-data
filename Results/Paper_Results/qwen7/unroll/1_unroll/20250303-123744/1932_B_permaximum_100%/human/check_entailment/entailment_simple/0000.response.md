Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and stores the test cases in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of signs `n` and the list of periodicities `a`.
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case and calculates the year in which the nth sign will occur.
3. The logic inside the function iterates over the periodicities and calculates the next occurrence year for each sign, ensuring that the next sign only occurs strictly after the previous one.
4. The function correctly handles the calculation of the next year using the formula:
   - If the current year is divisible by the periodicity (`current_year % ai == 0`), the next year is simply the current year plus the periodicity.
   - Otherwise, the next year is calculated as `(current_year // ai + 1) * ai`, which ensures the next year is the smallest multiple of the periodicity that is greater than the current year.
5. The function appends the final year for each test case to the results list and returns it.
6. The output matches the expected format, printing the year for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution states.

Correctness: **True**
