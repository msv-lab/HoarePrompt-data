You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version 0 \leq y \leq n - x . You
can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , 0 \leq y \leq n - x )
— the number of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen,
and the maximum number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 2
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    7 3 1
    
    6 4 3
    
    4 2 2
    
    1 3

Output

    6
    5
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 6 , 5 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that Bessie chose, the yellow dots represent
vertices that you chose, the blue lines represent diagonals that are drawn,
and the red numbers represent triangles that are counted.

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [num - 1 for num in a]
        ans = x - 2
        st = set(a)
        a.sort()

                even.append(gap)
        odd.sort()
        even.sort()
        for gap in odd:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        for gap in even:
            if y < gap // 2:
                ans += 2 * y
                y = 0
                break
            ans += gap
            y -= gap // 2
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), along with a list of \( x \) distinct integers representing chosen vertices. It calculates and prints an integer \( ans \) for each test case based on specific conditions involving these inputs. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it has printed the calculated \( ans \) for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for counting additional triangles using `y` extra vertices is flawed. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

### Example Case:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4 2 2
  1 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - The polygon has 4 sides, and Bessie has chosen vertices 1 and 3. With 2 additional vertices, we can form 2 non-intersecting triangular pieces of cake.

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program outputs 2, which seems correct at first glance. However, let's analyze the logic:

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Triangles:**
   - With vertices 1 and 3 chosen, we can initially form 1 triangle (using vertices 1, 2, and 3).
   - We need to check if we can form additional triangles using the remaining vertices.

2. **Checking for Additional Triangles:**
   - The program checks for gaps between the chosen vertices and tries to use these gaps to form additional triangles.
   - For the given example, the gaps are:
     - Gap between 1 and 3: 1 (odd)
   - The program processes the odd gaps first. Since the gap is 1, it cannot form another triangle directly.

3. **Using Extra Vertices:**
   - The program then tries to use the extra vertices (2 in this case) to form additional triangles.
   - It checks if the gap can be split into smaller segments using the extra vertices.

### Issue:
- The program incorrectly assumes that each odd gap can be split into smaller segments using the extra vertices. However, in this case, the gap is 1, and splitting it further is not possible without violating the non-intersecting condition.

### Correct Approach:
- For a polygon with 4 sides and 2 extra vertices, the maximum number of triangles that can be formed is indeed 2, but the program's logic for handling the gaps and extra vertices is flawed.

### Conclusion:
- The program does not correctly handle the case where the initial gaps are small and cannot be split further using the extra vertices.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect for this specific case, leading to the final verdict of **False**.
