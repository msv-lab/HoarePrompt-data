State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables in the loop head: The loop uses `_` as the iterator variable and `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations. The key variable here is `t`.
2. Determine the conditions for loop execution: The loop will execute if `t` is a positive integer and its value is within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).
3. Adjust the state: Since `t` is the only variable in the loop head that affects the loop's execution, it must be adjusted to meet the condition for the loop to run.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to 10^4.
