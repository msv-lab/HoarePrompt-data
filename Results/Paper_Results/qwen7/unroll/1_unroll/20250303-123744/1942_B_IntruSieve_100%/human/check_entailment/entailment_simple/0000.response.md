Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n` and the array `a`.
3. The function `func_1()` is defined to process each test case.
4. Inside `func_1()`, the program calculates the MEX values for each position in the permutation based on the given array `a`.
5. The logic to calculate MEX values seems to be correct:
   - If `arr[i] > 0`, it means the MEX value should be the current minimum unused value (`minn`).
   - If `arr[i] <= 0`, it means the MEX value should be adjusted by subtracting the current minimum unused value (`minn`) from the absolute value of `arr[i]`.
6. After calculating the MEX values, the program prints them out, which corresponds to constructing a valid permutation `p` based on the MEX values.
7. The program correctly handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.

Given the logic and the steps followed, the program appears to correctly generate a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
