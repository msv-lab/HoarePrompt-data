Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The program attempts to calculate the MEX but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the MEX value. Specifically, the `minn` variable is incremented only when `arr[i] > 0`, which is not always correct. The MEX should be determined based on the values that have already been used in the permutation, not just incrementing `minn`.

2. **Handling Negative Values**: The program incorrectly handles negative values in the array. When `arr[i]` is negative, it subtracts `abs(arr[i])` from `minn`, which can lead to incorrect results. Instead, the MEX should be calculated based on the unused values in the current state of the permutation.

3. **Logic for Finding MEX**: The logic for finding the MEX is flawed. The program should check the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the current permutation, rather than just incrementing `minn`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    perm = [-1] * n  # Initialize the permutation with -1
    used = set()  # Set to keep track of used values in the permutation
    
    for i in range(n):
        mex = 0
        while mex in used:
            mex += 1
        perm[i] = mex
        used.add(mex)
    
    # Adjust the permutation based on the given array
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] != -perm[i]:
            perm[i] = arr[i] + perm[i]
    
    for val in perm:
        print(val, end=' ')
    print()

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the MEX is correctly calculated and the permutation is adjusted according to the given array `a`.
