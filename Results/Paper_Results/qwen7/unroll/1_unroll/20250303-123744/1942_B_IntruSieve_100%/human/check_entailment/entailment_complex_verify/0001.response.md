### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
   - Each element \( a_i \) is defined as \( \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function reads the size of the permutation \( n \) and the array \( a \).
   - It initializes an empty list `mex` to store the MEX values.
   - It uses a dictionary `used` to keep track of which numbers have been used.
   - It iterates through the array \( a \):
     - If \( a_i \) is positive, it calculates the MEX up to \( i \) and appends it to `mex`.
     - If \( a_i \) is negative, it calculates the MEX adjusted by the absolute value of \( a_i \) and appends it to `mex`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating MEX seems correct. However, we need to ensure that the permutation \( p \) is correctly constructed.
   - The code does not explicitly construct the permutation \( p \). Instead, it constructs the MEX values directly.

4. **Constructing the Permutation \( p \):**
   - To construct \( p \), we need to ensure that the MEX values match the conditions specified by \( a \).
   - The current implementation only calculates the MEX values but does not ensure that the resulting permutation \( p \) satisfies the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).

5. **Example Analysis:**
   - Let's analyze the example provided:
     - For the input `[1, 1, -2, 1, 2]`, the function outputs `[0, 1, 4, 2, 3]`.
     - This output does not satisfy the condition \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \) for all \( i \).

6. **Correct Implementation:**
   - A correct implementation would involve constructing \( p \) such that the MEX values match the given \( a \).
   - The current implementation does not do this.

7. **Annotated Code Evaluation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the process of calculating MEX values, but it does not show how these values are used to construct the permutation \( p \).
   - The function `func_1` does not actually construct the permutation \( p \); instead, it only calculates the MEX values.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).
   - The annotated code confirms that the function only calculates MEX values and does not construct the permutation \( p \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). Therefore, the program is incorrect.
