Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop iterates over the `mex` list using `itm` as the iterator variable.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - `itm`: This variable takes each element from the `mex` list one by one during each iteration of the loop.
   - `mex`: This list contains elements that are increments of `minn` based on certain conditions in the loop. For the loop to execute, `mex` must contain at least one element.

3. **Analyze the initial state**:
   - `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `a`.
   - `mex` is a list containing elements that are increments of `minn` based on conditions in the loop.
   - `used` is a dictionary marking integers that have been used according to the loop logic.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `mex`, `mex` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. Therefore, `mex` must have at least one element.
   - `itm` will take the value of each element in `mex` during each iteration, but we don't need to specify its initial value since it changes with each iteration.

5. **Final state**:
   - The initial state of `minn` and `used` does not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.
   - The key adjustment needed is ensuring that `mex` contains at least one element.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`mex` must have at least one element**.
