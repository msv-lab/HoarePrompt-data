Output State: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. After executing the loop, res is a list of n integers representing the result of the computation described in the loop body.
