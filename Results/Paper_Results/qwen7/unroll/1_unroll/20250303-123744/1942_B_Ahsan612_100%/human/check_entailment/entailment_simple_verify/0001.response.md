### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that for each index \( i \), \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
   - The function \(\texttt{MEX}\) returns the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes a list `res` with `None` values.
   - It iterates backward through the array `ar` and calculates the value for each position in `res`.
   - For each index \( i \), it sets \( res[i] = \texttt{MEX} - ar[i] \).
   - It updates \(\texttt{MEX}\) to ensure it correctly reflects the smallest non-negative integer not present in the current prefix of \( p \).

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic for calculating \(\texttt{MEX}\) in the given solution is indeed flawed. It does not consider the actual elements of \( p \) that have been assigned, which means it cannot correctly determine the \(\texttt{MEX}\) for each prefix.
   - The solution should maintain a set of used indices to correctly compute \(\texttt{MEX}\) for each prefix.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of used indices and dynamically updating \(\texttt{MEX}\) based on the current state of the permutation \( p \).

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code shows that the program iterates backward through the array `ar` and assigns values to `res` based on the calculated \(\texttt{MEX}\).
   - However, the calculation of \(\texttt{MEX}\) is incorrect because it does not account for the actual elements of \( p \).

6. **Correctness of the Given Program:**
   - The given program does not correctly implement the logic to construct the permutation \( p \) based on the given array `ar`.
   - The solution fails to maintain a proper set of used indices and correctly compute \(\texttt{MEX}\).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not properly handle the calculation of \(\texttt{MEX}\) and the construction of the permutation \( p \). Therefore, the given program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
