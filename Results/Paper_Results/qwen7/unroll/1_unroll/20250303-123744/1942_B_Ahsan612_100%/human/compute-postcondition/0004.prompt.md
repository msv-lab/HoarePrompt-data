You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n integers where -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        res = [None] * n
        
        mex = n
        
        for i in range(len(ar) - 1, -1, -1):
            res[i] = mex - ar[i]
            if mex > mex - ar[i]:
                mex = mex - ar[i]
        
        print(' '.join(str(x) for x in res))
        
    #State: Output State: t test cases, each with n integers representing the result of the transformation applied to the input list ar. For each test case, the result list res is generated by iterating over the input list ar in reverse order, calculating the minimum excluded number (mex) for each position, and storing the difference between mex and the current element of ar in the corresponding position of res. The final output for each test case is a space-separated string of these differences.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers with -n ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. For each test case, the function returns a result based on the given inputs.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
