Reasoning:

1. The problem requires constructing a permutation \( p \) from the given array \( a \), where \( a_i = \texttt{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
2. The provided solution iterates over the array \( a \) in reverse order, which is a key aspect to correctly calculate the MEX value for each position in the permutation \( p \).
3. The logic inside the loop calculates the MEX value and assigns it to the corresponding position in the result list \( res \). This approach ensures that the MEX value is correctly updated for each step.
4. The code handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement, ensuring that the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^5 \).

Given the above points, the provided solution appears to correctly implement the logic to generate the permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \).

Correctness: **True**
