Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down why:

1. **Input Parsing**: The input is parsed correctly into a list `p` which contains the counts of ones, twos, threes, and fours.
2. **Odd Count Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the number of odd counts among the first three elements (`p[:3]`) using `sum(list(map(lambda x: x % 2 > 0, p[:3])))`. However, this approach does not correctly determine the optimal strategy for Bob to win.

### Correct Approach:
To determine the maximum number of times Bob can win, we need to consider the following:
- If there is an odd number of ones, Alice can always win because the XOR of all numbers will be non-zero.
- If there is no odd number of ones, Bob can win if there are enough twos, threes, and fours to ensure the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ones, twos, threes, fours = p
        
        # Calculate the total number of elements
        total_elements = ones + twos + threes + fours
        
        # If there is an odd number of ones, Alice wins immediately
        if ones % 2 != 0:
            print(0)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of moves Bob can make to ensure he wins
            # Bob needs to remove elements such that the XOR of the remaining elements is zero
            # This means removing pairs of twos, threes, and fours
            remaining_elements = total_elements - ones
            bob_wins = min(remaining_elements // 2, ones // 2)
            print(bob_wins)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected function correctly calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by ensuring that the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero, considering the optimal removal of elements by Eve.
