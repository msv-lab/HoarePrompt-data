Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character in the string representation of numbers from 0 to n-1 that is less than the character at index `max_index`, or 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing the indices of all elements `i` in the range 0 to n-1 for which `func_1(max_index, min_indices[0], max_index, i)` returns either '<' or '=', `min_index` is `min_indices[0]`**.

Explanation: The line `min_index = min_indices[0]` assigns the value of the first element in the `min_indices` list to the variable `min_index`. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.
