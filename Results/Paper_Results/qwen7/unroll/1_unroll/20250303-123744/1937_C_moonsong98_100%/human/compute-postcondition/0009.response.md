Output State: **`max_index` is the index of the first character in the string representation of numbers from 0 to n-1 that is less than the character at index `max_index`, or 0 if no such character exists; `min_indices` is a list containing `max_index`.**

Explanation: The line `min_indices = [max_index]` creates a list `min_indices` and assigns it the value `[max_index]`. The value of `max_index` remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, the output state includes both the updated list `min_indices` and the unchanged `max_index`.
