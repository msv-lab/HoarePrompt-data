### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Character Set Analysis**: For each test case, the function converts the string `s` into a set `a` to check the unique characters. This is a good approach to identify if there are exactly two unique characters.
3. **Condition Check**: If the set `a` has exactly two unique characters, the function prints 'NO', which is correct because rearranging a string with only two unique characters cannot produce a different string.
4. **Generating Different String `r`**:
   - If the set `a` does not have exactly two unique characters, the function prints 'YES'.
   - It then sorts the string `s` both in ascending and descending order.
   - If the sorted string in ascending order (`b`) is the same as the original string `s`, it means the original string was already sorted in ascending order. In this case, it prints the string sorted in descending order (`c`).
   - Otherwise, it prints the string sorted in ascending order (`b`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge case where the string has only two unique characters correctly by printing 'NO'.
   - For other cases, it generates a different string by sorting the characters in either ascending or descending order, ensuring the new string is different from the original.

6. **Output Format**: The function follows the required output format, printing 'YES' or 'NO' followed by the new string `r`.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate a different string `r` if possible, and prints 'NO' when it's not possible. The solution is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
