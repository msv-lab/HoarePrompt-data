The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks if the unique characters in `s` form exactly two distinct characters. If so, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then either the lexicographically sorted version of `s` in descending order or the ascending order, depending on which matches the original string `s`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
