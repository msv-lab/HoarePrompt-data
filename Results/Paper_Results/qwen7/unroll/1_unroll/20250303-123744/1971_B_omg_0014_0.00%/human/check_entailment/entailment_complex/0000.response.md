Reasoning:
- The function `func()` correctly handles the input format and the constraints specified in the problem.
- It iterates over each test case and checks if the string `s` consists of exactly two distinct characters.
- If `s` consists of exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'NO', which is correct because rearranging such a string would result in the same string.
- If `s` does not consist of exactly two distinct characters, it prints 'YES' and then checks whether the lexicographically sorted version of `s` (in ascending order) is the same as the original string `s`.
  - If they are the same, it prints the lexicographically sorted version of `s` in descending order.
  - If they are different, it prints the lexicographically sorted version of `s` in ascending order.
- The logic ensures that the generated string `r` is different from `s` whenever possible, and it correctly handles cases where rearranging `s` to get a different string is not possible.

Given the above analysis, the function appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
