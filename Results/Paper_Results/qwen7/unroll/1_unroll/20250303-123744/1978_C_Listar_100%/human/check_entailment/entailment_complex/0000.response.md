Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4`**: This function ensures that `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length `n`. If `k` is odd or if the maximum possible Manhattan value is less than `k`, it returns `(0, 0)`. Otherwise, it returns `n` and the adjusted even value of `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to construct a permutation whose Manhattan value is `k` by iterating over the list `l` in reverse order. It adjusts `k` and calls other functions to swap elements in specific ways to achieve the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_2`**: This function swaps elements at specific indices in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value. It is called when `k` is less than the current index minus one.

4. **Function `func_3`**: This function swaps elements at specific indices in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value. It is called after adjusting `k` in `func_1`.

5. **Function `func_5`**: This function prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l`, indicating a valid permutation, and then prints an empty line.

6. **Function `func_6`**: This function orchestrates the process by calling `func_4` to get `n` and the adjusted `k`, then constructs the permutation using `func_1` and prints the result using `func_5`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated functions, the overall logic seems to correctly handle the constraints and requirements. The functions collectively ensure that:
- `func_4` correctly adjusts `k` to be even and checks feasibility.
- `func_1` constructs the permutation by iteratively adjusting the Manhattan value.
- `func_2` and `func_3` handle the necessary swaps.
- `func_5` prints the valid permutation if found.

Since the functions work together to meet the problem's requirements and constraints, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
