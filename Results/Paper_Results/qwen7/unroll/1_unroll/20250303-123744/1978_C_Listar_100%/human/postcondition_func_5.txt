The function accepts no parameters and returns either `None` or the value of `l`, which is the result of calling `func_5(l)` with the input `l` that itself is the result of `func_1(n, k)`, where `n` and `k` are both the results of calling `func_4()`. If `n` is 0, the function prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds to compute `l` and then returns its value.
