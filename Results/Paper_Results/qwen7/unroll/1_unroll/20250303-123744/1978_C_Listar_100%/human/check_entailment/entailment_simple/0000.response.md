### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function checks if `k` is even and calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value (`max_k`) for a permutation of length `n`.
   - It ensures that `k` is even and `max_k` is at least `k`. If not, it returns `(0, 0)`.
   - If `n` is odd, `max_k` is calculated as `((n // 2) * 2) + 1`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is simply `n`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function attempts to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
   - It iteratively modifies the list `l` by swapping elements to reduce the Manhattan value.
   - The loop runs until `k` becomes zero or cannot be reduced further.

3. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` based on the current value of `c` and `k`.
   - It ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly by swapping elements at specific indices.

4. **Function `func_3()`**:
   - This function swaps two elements in the list `l` to adjust the Manhattan value.
   - It ensures that the Manhattan value is adjusted correctly by swapping elements at specific indices.

5. **Function `func_5()`**:
   - This function prints "YES" followed by the constructed permutation.
   - It prints the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces and ends with a newline.

6. **Function `func_6()`**:
   - This function orchestrates the entire process.
   - It calls `func_4()` to get `n` and `k`, then calls `func_1()` to construct the permutation, and finally calls `func_5()` to print the result.

### Analysis:

- The overall logic of the program is sound and follows the problem statement.
- The functions `func_1()`, `func_2()`, and `func_3()` work together to construct a permutation with the desired Manhattan value.
- The function `func_4()` ensures that `k` is even and within the feasible range.
- The function `func_5()` correctly prints the permutation if it exists.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find a permutation with the desired Manhattan value or determine that no such permutation exists. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
