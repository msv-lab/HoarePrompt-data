Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` attempts to construct a permutation based on the given `n` and `k`, but it does not cover all possible scenarios, particularly when `k` is odd or when the maximum possible Manhattan value for a given `n` is less than `k`.

Here is a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
1
5 12
```

The maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length 5 is calculated as follows:
\[ \text{Max Manhattan value} = \sum_{i=1}^{5} |i - i| = 0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20 \]

Since 12 is within this range, a valid permutation should exist. However, the current implementation does not guarantee finding such a permutation. For instance, the function `func_1` might not correctly rearrange elements to achieve the required Manhattan value of 12.

To illustrate, let's manually construct a permutation for `n = 5` and `k = 12`:
A valid permutation could be `[5, 1, 3, 2, 4]`:
\[ |5-1| + |1-2| + |3-3| + |2-4| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 8 \]
This permutation does not meet the requirement, indicating that the program might not handle all cases correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not guarantee a solution for all valid inputs.
