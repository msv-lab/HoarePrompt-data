### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly parses the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly identifies the initial positions of the Quaffle and goals.

2. **Movement and Action Handling:**
   - The program correctly updates the positions of players and the Quaffle based on the given movements.
   - It handles the elimination of players when they collide with Bludgers.
   - It correctly updates the Quaffle's position when a player catches or throws it.
   - The logic for scoring points is correctly implemented. When a player scores in the wrong goal, the opposing team gets a point.
   - The program prints the appropriate events (scoring, elimination) in the correct order.

3. **Final Score Calculation:**
   - After processing all actions, the program correctly calculates and prints the final score.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the new position of an entity based on the given direction.

However, there is a critical issue in the implementation of the function `func_1`. The function is defined to take a list of strings and an integer, but it is used to compute the new position of an entity on the grid. The function should take a tuple representing the current position and a direction, and return a new tuple representing the updated position.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```
- The function `func_1` expects a list `a` and an integer `b`.
- However, it is used in the context of updating the position of entities on the grid, where `a` should be a tuple of coordinates and `b` should be a direction.

To fix this, the function should be modified to accept a tuple and a direction:
```python
def func_1(position, direction):
    (x, y) = position
    (dx, dy) = mouvements[direction]
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly update the position of the entities on the grid.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete due to the misinterpretation of the function `func_1`. The function should take a tuple representing the position and a direction, not a list and an integer.

### Corrected Function:
```python
def func_1(position, direction):
    (x, y) = position
    (dx, dy) = mouvements[direction]
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the misuse of the `func_1` function.
