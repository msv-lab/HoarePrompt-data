Reasoning:
1. The annotated program seems to have a misunderstanding in the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to handle movement on the game field, but it incorrectly concatenates strings instead of updating the coordinates.
2. The function should take a coordinate `(x, y)` and a direction `(dx, dy)` and return the new coordinate `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
3. However, the function currently returns a tuple of concatenated strings, which is incorrect and will not update the coordinates correctly.
4. The rest of the logic in the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem description. It handles player movements, ball movements, scoring, and elimination correctly.

Given these observations, the core issue is with the `func_1` function, which is incorrectly implemented.

Correctness: **False**
