You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        print(ans)

            cnt_b[i] = 0



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). For each test case, it counts the number of valid subarrays in a that contain at least k elements also present in b. It prints the count for each test case and resets the count array cnt_b to zero after processing each test case. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The program initializes `cnt_b` to count occurrences of elements in `b`.
2. It iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` from the input.
4. It then reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
5. It counts the occurrences of elements in `b` using `cnt_b`.
6. It checks the initial segment of `a` of length `m` to see if it meets the condition of having at least `k` elements from `b`. This is done by iterating through the first `m` elements of `a` and updating `curr` which counts the number of matching elements.
7. If `curr` is greater than or equal to `k`, it increments `ans`.
8. It then slides the window across the rest of the array `a` of length `n-m`. For each new element entering the window and each element leaving the window, it updates `cnt_b` and `curr` accordingly.
9. If `curr` remains greater than or equal to `k` after these updates, it increments `ans`.
10. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

The logic seems to correctly implement the sliding window approach to check each subsegment of `a` of length `m` to see if it contains at least `k` elements from `b`. The use of `cnt_b` and `curr` ensures that the program efficiently counts the required matches without needing to sort or fully rearrange the subsegments.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.
