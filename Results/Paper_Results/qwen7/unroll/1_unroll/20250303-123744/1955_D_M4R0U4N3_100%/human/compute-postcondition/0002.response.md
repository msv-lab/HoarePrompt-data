Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer value. This means the loop will continue until the user inputs a non-positive integer.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**: 
   - The variable `_` is a dummy variable used in the loop, and its value is not relevant for determining the loop's execution.
   - The expression `int(input())` is what controls the loop's continuation. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided by the user results in a positive integer.

4. **Consider the given state**: 
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `max_val` is 1000000.
   - `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.

5. **Adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute**: 
   - Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer within a reasonable range (as implied by the problem constraints).

Given these considerations, the state that needs adjustment is the input value that will be read by `int(input())`. To ensure the loop can execute, this value should be a positive integer.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros, and the input must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4**.
