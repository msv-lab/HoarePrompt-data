You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. b is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.

                cnt_b[a[i]] += 1
                if cnt_b[a[i]] > 0:
                    curr -= 1
            if a[i + m] in b_values:
                cnt_b[a[i + m]] -= 1
                if cnt_b[a[i + m]] >= 0:
                    curr += 1
            if curr >= k:
                ans += 1
        
        print(ans)
        
        for i in b_values:
            cnt_b[i] = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, max_val is 1000000, cnt_b is a list of 1000001 zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it updates the `cnt_b` list based on the input arrays `a` and `b`, calculates the value of `ans`, and then resets `cnt_b` to zero for the next iteration. After all iterations of the loop are completed, the `cnt_b` list is reset to zero for every test case, so it remains a list of 1000001 zeros. The values of `t` and `max_val` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes integers t, n, m, k, a (a list of n integers), and b (a list of m integers). The function returns a result based on the given constraints and inputs for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
