### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \(N\) and \(M\) of the grid.
   - It initializes the grid and a dictionary `elements` to store the positions of different entities.
   - It also initializes dictionaries `allPlayers` and `goal` to keep track of players and goals respectively.
   - The points for both teams are initialized to zero.

2. **Processing the Field Description:**
   - The program correctly processes the field description and updates the `elements` dictionary with the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle.
   - It correctly identifies and stores the positions of goals for both teams.

3. **Reading and Processing Actions:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of steps \(T\).
   - For each step, it processes the command and updates the positions of players and the Quaffle.
   - It handles the movement of players and the Quaffle correctly.
   - It checks if a player is moving to a goal and updates the score accordingly.
   - It correctly handles the catching and throwing of the Quaffle.

4. **Outputting Events and Final Score:**
   - The program prints the events in the correct order.
   - It correctly calculates and prints the final score at the end of the game.

5. **Helper Functions:**
   - The helper functions `goalIn`, `isPlayer`, and the movement dictionary `mov` are used appropriately to handle specific tasks such as checking if a position is a goal, determining if an entity is a player, and handling movements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It processes the input, updates the state of the game, and outputs the correct events and final score.

### Correctness:
**True**
