Output State: **`res` is True if `el` starts with 'B' or 'R' and does not end with 'G', otherwise `res` is False**.

Explanation: The code checks if the first character of `el` is either 'B' or 'R' and also ensures that `el` does not end with 'G'. If both conditions are met, `res` is set to `True`; otherwise, it is set to `False`. The initial values of `el` (a string representing an entity on the field) remain unchanged, but now `res` holds the result of the logical operation based on the value of `el`.
