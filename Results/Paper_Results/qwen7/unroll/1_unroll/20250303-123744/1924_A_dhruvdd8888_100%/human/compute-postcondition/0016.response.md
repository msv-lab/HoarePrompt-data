Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through predefined constraints where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^5\), for each test case `n` and `k` are integers within the ranges 1 to 26 and 1 to 26 respectively, `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and `s` is a string of length `m` consisting of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets. The function checks if certain conditions are met across all test cases and prints 'YES' if they are.**
