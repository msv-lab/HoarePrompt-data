### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to verify if every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occurs as a subsequence in the given string `s`. If not, we need to provide an example of such a string.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle one test case.
   - It reads `n`, `k`, and `m` from the input, followed by the string `s`.
   - It initializes a set `us` containing the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - It uses a set `win` to keep track of the characters encountered in the current window of size `n`.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and updates `win` when a character in `s` matches one in `us`.
   - If `win` contains all `k` characters, it appends the character to `ans` and resets `win`.
   - After processing the entire string, it checks if `ps` (the count of complete windows) is at least `n`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the case where all possible strings of length `n` are present in `s` as subsequences.
   - However, the logic for identifying and printing a missing string of length `n` is flawed. Specifically, the function only checks for the presence of the first `k` characters in `win` and does not ensure that these characters form a valid string of length `n`.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - If all possible strings of length `n` are found, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" but does not necessarily provide a valid example of a missing string of length `n`.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - For the first test case (`2 2 4` with `s = "abba"`), the output is "YES" because all possible strings ("aa", "ab", "ba", "bb") are subsequences.
   - For the second test case (`2 2 3` with `s = "abb"`), the output is "NO" and an example is "aa" because "aa" is not a subsequence.
   - For the third test case (`3 3 10` with `s = "aabbccabab"`), the output is "NO" and an example is "ccc" because "ccc" is not a subsequence.

However, the function does not guarantee that the provided example is a valid string of length `n` that cannot be formed as a subsequence. For instance, in the third test case, the function might incorrectly identify "ccc" as a valid example even if "aab" or "bca" would be a better choice.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is **inaccurate** because the function does not correctly ensure that the provided example is a valid string of length `n` that cannot be formed as a subsequence.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
