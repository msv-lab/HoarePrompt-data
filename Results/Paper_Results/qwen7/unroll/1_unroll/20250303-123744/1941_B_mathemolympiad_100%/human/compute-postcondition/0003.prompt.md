Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numTest` is an integer input, t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j in the array. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(0, numTest):
    n = int(input())
    a = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    stop = False
    for i in range(0, n - 2):
        if a[i] < 0:
            print('NO')
            stop = True
            break
        opNum = a[i]
        a[i] -= opNum
        a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum
        a[i + 2] -= opNum
    if stop == True:
        continue
    if a[len(a) - 1] != 0 or a[len(a) - 2] != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
