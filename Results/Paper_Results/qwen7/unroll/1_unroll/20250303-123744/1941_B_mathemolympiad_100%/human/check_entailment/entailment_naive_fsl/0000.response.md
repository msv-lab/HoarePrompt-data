Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to reduce the array elements to zero by repeatedly applying the operation but does not handle the array correctly. Here's a detailed explanation:

1. The program iterates through the array and checks if any element is less than 0. If it finds such an element, it immediately prints 'NO' and stops further processing. However, this approach is incorrect because it only checks for negative elements after applying the operation, which might not be sufficient to determine if the array can be reduced to all zeros.

2. The program incorrectly applies the operation by setting `a[i] -= opNum`, `a[i + 1] -= 2 * opNum`, and `a[i + 2] -= opNum`. This logic does not correctly simulate the operation as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the operation should be applied to indices `i-1`, `i`, and `i+1` respectively, not `i`, `i+1`, and `i+2`.

3. After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements are zero. However, this check is insufficient because the operation might not be able to reduce all elements to zero even if the last two elements are zero.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```

The program would apply the operation at index 2 (since `i = 2`), resulting in the array `[1, 2, 3, 3, 1]`. It would then apply the operation again at index 2, resulting in `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`. Finally, it would apply the operation at index 3, resulting in `[1, 1, 0, 0, 1]`. At this point, the program would incorrectly print 'NO' because it checks the last two elements and finds them not zero, but it fails to recognize that the array can still be reduced to all zeros with further operations.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem and is incorrect.
