### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Array Processing**: The program iterates through indices from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), which is correct since the operation is defined for `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`. However, there is a potential issue with the loop condition and the way the operation is applied.
3. **Operation Application**: The program applies the operation as specified, reducing `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Early Termination**: If any element becomes negative during the process, the program prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This is correct.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'. This check ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros. However, this check alone is not sufficient to guarantee that the array can be made zero.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the program assumes that the operations can always reduce the array to all zeros, which is not necessarily true. The provided solution only checks the last two elements, but it does not ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero.

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly simulate the operations to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero. The current implementation only checks the last two elements after the loop, which is insufficient to determine if the entire array can be made zero.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly simulate the operations to ensure that the entire array can be reduced to zero. The program only checks the last two elements, which is not sufficient to guarantee the correctness of the solution.

Final: **False**
