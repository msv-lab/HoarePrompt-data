### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program processes the array by iterating through indices from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), which is correct since the operation is defined for `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.
3. **Operation Application**: The program applies the operation as specified, reducing `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Early Termination**: If any element becomes negative during the process, the program prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This is also correct.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'. This check ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the array might not be reducible to all zeros, such as when the initial values do not allow the operations to make all elements zero.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
