Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`numTest`) and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program processes the array `a` by iterating from the start to the third last element (`n - 2`). During each iteration, it performs the specified operation if the current element is non-negative:
   - Decrements `a[i]` by `opNum`.
   - Decrements `a[i+1]` by `2 * opNum`.
   - Decrements `a[i+2]` by `opNum`.

3. **Negative Element Check**: If at any point during the processing, an element becomes negative, the program immediately prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This ensures that no invalid state is reached.

4. **Final Check**: After processing the entire array, the program checks the last two elements:
   - If either of the last two elements is non-zero, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the array might become negative during the operations, which would lead to an immediate 'NO'.
   - It also correctly handles the final check for the last two elements.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

Correctness: **True**
