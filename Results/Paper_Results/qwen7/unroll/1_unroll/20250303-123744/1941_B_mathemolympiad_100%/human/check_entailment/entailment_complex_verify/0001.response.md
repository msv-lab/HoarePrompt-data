### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program processes the array by iterating through indices from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive). However, the operation is defined for `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`, so the current implementation is incorrect because it starts from `0` instead of `1`.
3. **Operation Application**: The program applies the operation as specified, reducing `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively. This is correct according to the problem statement, but the starting index is wrong.
4. **Early Termination**: If any element becomes negative during the process, the program prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This is correct.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'. This check ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the array might not be reducible to all zeros, such as when the initial values do not allow the operations to make all elements zero. However, due to the incorrect starting index, the program may not handle some edge cases correctly.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it starts the loop from `0` instead of `1`, which violates the problem statement. The correct starting index should be `1` to ensure that the operation is applied only to valid indices `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the program incorrectly starts the loop from `0` instead of `1`, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Final:
**False**
