You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: After executing the loop for all test cases, for each test case, if there exists any negative value in the array `a` before the end of the array (i.e., indices from 0 to n-3), the program prints 'NO' for that test case and moves to the next test case. If no negative values are found and the last two elements of the array are zero, the program prints 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. All other variables and their states remain unchanged.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Array Processing**: For each test case, the program processes the array by iterating through indices from `0` to `n-3` (inclusive), which is correct since the operation is defined for `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`.
3. **Operation Application**: The program applies the operation as specified, reducing `a[i]`, `a[i+1]`, and `a[i+2]` by `opNum`, `2*opNum`, and `opNum` respectively. This is correct according to the problem statement.
4. **Early Termination**: If any element becomes negative during the process, the program prints 'NO' and stops further processing for that test case. This is also correct.
5. **Final Check**: After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements (`a[n-1]` and `a[n-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', otherwise 'YES'. This check ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros.
6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases where the array might not be reducible to all zeros, such as when the initial values do not allow the operations to make all elements zero.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.
