    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in the list represents the number of missing characters for each test case, calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`. The frequencies are determined by counting how many times each character ('A' to 'G') appears in the string `a`, and then calculating how many more occurrences of each character are needed to reach `m` for each character.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named `results` which contains `t` elements. Each element in the list represents the number of missing characters for each test case, calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character ('A' to 'G') in the corresponding string `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of additional problems of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') needed for each test case to meet the required number of problems (`m`) in the upcoming rounds. For each test case, it counts the frequency of each character in the given string of problem difficulties, then determines the shortfall for each character by comparing these frequencies with the required number of problems (`m`). The function processes `t` test cases and returns a list of these shortfalls for each test case.
