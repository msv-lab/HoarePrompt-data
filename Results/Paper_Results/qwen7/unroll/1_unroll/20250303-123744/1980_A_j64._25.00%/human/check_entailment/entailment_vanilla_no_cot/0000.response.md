Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. The function `func_1` processes each test case, counts the frequency of each difficulty level, calculates how many problems are missing for the required number of rounds, and appends this value to the results list. This matches the problem description and the example input/output provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
