Reasoning:
1. The program correctly parses the input data and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It iterates over each test case, calculating the frequency of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') using the `freq` array.
3. For each test case, it calculates the number of additional problems needed for each difficulty level by comparing the required number of rounds (`m`) with the current frequency of each difficulty level.
4. The sum of these differences gives the total number of additional problems needed for that test case.
5. The program constructs the `results` list by appending the calculated values for each test case.
6. The final output matches the expected format and values as shown in the example.

Given the logic and the steps followed in the annotated program, the implementation appears to be correct according to the problem statement and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
