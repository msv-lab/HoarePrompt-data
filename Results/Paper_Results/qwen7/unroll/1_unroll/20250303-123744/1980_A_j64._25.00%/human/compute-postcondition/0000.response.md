Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three elements: n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <= m <= 5, and a is a string of length n consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', and a function is defined to calculate the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.**

The code defines a function without executing it, so the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged. The function itself does not modify any external variables, only operates within its scope. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged initial state along with the definition of the function.
