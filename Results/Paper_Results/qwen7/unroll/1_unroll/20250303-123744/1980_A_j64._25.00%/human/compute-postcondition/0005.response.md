Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements. Each element in the list represents the number of missing characters for each test case, calculated as the sum of the maximum differences between `m` and the frequency of each character in the string `a`. The frequencies are determined by counting how many times each character ('A' to 'G') appears in the string `a`, and then calculating how many more occurrences of each character are needed to reach `m` for each character.
