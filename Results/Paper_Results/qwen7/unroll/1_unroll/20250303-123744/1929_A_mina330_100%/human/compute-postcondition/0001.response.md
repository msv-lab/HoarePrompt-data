State: **ntest is an input integer such that 1 ≤ ntest ≤ 500, itest is 0**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `itest` starts at 0.
- The range function `range(0, ntest, 1)` means the loop will run from 0 up to but not including `ntest`.
- For the loop to execute, `ntest` must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 500 (inclusive).
- Therefore, the initial value of `itest` is set to 0, and `ntest` must be within the specified range to ensure the loop can execute.
