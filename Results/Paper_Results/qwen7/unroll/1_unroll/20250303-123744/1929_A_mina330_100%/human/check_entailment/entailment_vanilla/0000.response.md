### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \((a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) + \ldots + (a_n - a_{n-1})\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element, thereby maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then sorts the array and prints the difference between the last (largest) and the first (smallest) elements.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - Sorting the array and taking the difference between the last and first elements will indeed maximize the beauty because:
     - The sorted array ensures that the smallest element is paired with the largest possible next element.
     - This maximizes the positive differences between consecutive elements.
   - The code does not handle negative differences but since the problem specifies non-negative values, this approach is valid.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all elements in the array are the same, the beauty will be zero, which is correctly handled by the code.
   - The code handles arrays of different lengths and values within the specified constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to maximize the beauty of the array.
