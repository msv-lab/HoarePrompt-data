Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem requires maximizing the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). However, the current implementation simply sorts the array and prints the difference between the largest and smallest elements, which does not maximize the beauty according to the given definition.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the array such that the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) are maximized. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then placing the smallest and largest elements alternately, ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are as large as possible.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        max_beauty = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            max_beauty += abs(a[i] - a[i-1])
        print(max_beauty)
```

This corrected program calculates the maximum beauty by iterating through the sorted array and summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

Correctness: **False**
