Output State: **a is a non-negative integer, b is a non-negative integer not equal to 0, a >= b > 0, a is not divisible by b, c is the quotient of b divided by (a % b), d is the remainder of b divided by (a % b)**.

Explanation: The code calls a function `func_1(b, a % b)` which returns two values `c` and `d`. Since `a` is not divisible by `b`, `a % b` is not zero. The function `func_1` is not specified, but based on the typical Euclidean algorithm, `c` would be the quotient and `d` would be the remainder when `b` is divided by `(a % b)`. However, without the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can only describe the general behavior. The conditions on `a` and `b` remain unchanged.
