You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is an integer, and b is a list of integers where the length of b is equal to the number of test cases. Each element in b is a tuple (m1, m2, n) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. Additionally, m1, m2, and n satisfy the constraints 1 ≤ m1, m2, n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_2(a, b):
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then taken modulo 1000000007.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `a`, an integer; and `b`, a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (m1, m2, n) representing the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively. The function returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then taken modulo 1000000007.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the value of `c` multiplied by `a` and then taken modulo 1000000007.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
