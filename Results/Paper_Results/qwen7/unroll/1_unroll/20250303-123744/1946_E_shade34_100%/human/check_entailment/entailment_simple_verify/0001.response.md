### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to count the number of permutations of length `n` that satisfy given conditions of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The prefix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements before it.
   - The suffix maximums are the indices where the element is the largest among all elements after it.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If there is an overlap between the prefix and suffix maximums, the only possible permutation is one where the maximum element is placed at the overlapping index.
   - If there is no overlap, we can independently place the maximum elements for the prefix and suffix parts.

3. **Algorithm Breakdown:**
   - The given code includes two helper functions `func_1` and `func_2`.
     - `func_1` computes the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.
     - `func_2` uses `func_1` to compute the modular exponentiation efficiently.
   - The main part of the code processes the input and uses these functions to calculate the number of valid permutations.

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires counting permutations, which involves combinatorial calculations.
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are used to perform necessary modular arithmetic operations, which are essential for calculating combinations and permutations under modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Correctness Check:**
   - The code correctly handles the combinatorial logic to place the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - It calculates the number of ways to arrange the remaining elements between the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

6. **Detailed Analysis:**
   - The code initializes the factorial values up to 200002 using the `facts` list.
   - For each test case, it checks if the prefix and suffix maximums are consistent.
   - It then calculates the number of valid permutations using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic.
   - The logic correctly accounts for the placement of maximum elements and the arrangement of the remaining elements.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to solve the permutation problem as described. The provided code uses the necessary combinatorial and modular arithmetic operations to count the valid permutations.

**Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
