Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input to extract the necessary parameters \( n \), \( m_1 \), \( m_2 \), the indices of prefix maximums \( p \), and the indices of suffix maximums \( s \).

2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The program checks for edge cases where the last index of prefix maximums does not match the first index of suffix maximums, or where the first index of prefix maximums is not 1, or the last index of suffix maximums is not \( n \). If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, which is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Combinatorial Calculation**: The program uses combinatorial calculations to determine the number of permutations that fit the given constraints. Specifically, it calculates combinations using the `func_2` function, which in turn uses the `func_1` function to compute modular inverses.

4. **Modulo Operation**: All intermediate results are taken modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle large numbers, which is correct.

5. **Loop Logic**: The loops in the program correctly iterate over the indices of prefix and suffix maximums to perform the necessary calculations. The logic for updating `kol` and calculating combinations seems to follow the problem's requirements.

Given the execution summaries and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It handles all the necessary cases and performs the required calculations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
