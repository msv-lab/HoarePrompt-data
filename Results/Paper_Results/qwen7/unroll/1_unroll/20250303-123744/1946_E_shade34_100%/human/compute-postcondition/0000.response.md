Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a list of tuples (m1, m2, n), `c` is the result of func_1(b, 1000000007), `d` is the result of func_1(b, 1000000007)**.

Explanation: The code snippet assigns the return values of the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)` to the variables `c` and `d`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values of `c` and `d`. However, we know that `c` and `d` are the results of the function call with the argument `b` and the modulus `1000000007`. The initial state of `a` and `b` remains unchanged.
