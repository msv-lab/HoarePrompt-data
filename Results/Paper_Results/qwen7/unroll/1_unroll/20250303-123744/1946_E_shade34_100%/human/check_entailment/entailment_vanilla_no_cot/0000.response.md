Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code includes two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, but these functions do not seem to be directly related to solving the problem described. The problem requires determining the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, which involves combinatorial logic rather than the mathematical operations implemented in these functions.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to implement logic that takes into account the constraints and properties of prefix and suffix maximums. The functions provided do not address the core requirements of the problem, hence the correctness is False.
