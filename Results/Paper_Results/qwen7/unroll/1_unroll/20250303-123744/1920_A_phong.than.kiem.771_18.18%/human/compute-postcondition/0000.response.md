Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a non-empty string, and substring is guaranteed to appear in string at least once; `indices` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `indices`. This does not affect the values of `string` or `substring`, but it sets `indices` to an empty list.
