Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `to_int` is a list of strings, the function returns a list of integers derived from those strings. If `to_int` is a dictionary containing the number of test cases 't' and a list of constraints, the function returns the number of test cases 't' along with a list of constraints for each test case, where each constraint is represented by two integers 'a' and 'x', with 'a' being either 1, 2, or 3, and 'x' being an integer between 1 and \(10^9\). There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.**
