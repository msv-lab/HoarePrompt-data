You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Rudolf has a string s of length n . Rudolf considers the string s to be ugly
if it contains the substring^\dagger "pie" or the substring "map", otherwise
the string s will be considered beautiful.

For example, "ppiee", "mmap", "dfpiefghmap" are ugly strings, while "mathp",
"ppiiee" are beautiful strings.

Rudolf wants to shorten the string s by removing some characters to make it
beautiful.

The main character doesn't like to strain, so he asks you to make the string
beautiful by removing the minimum number of characters. He can remove
characters from any positions in the string (not just from the beginning or
end of the string).

^\dagger String a is a substring of b if there exists a consecutive segment of
characters in string b equal to a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10^6
) — the length of the string s .

The next line of each test case contains the string s of length n . The string
s consists of lowercase Latin letters.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of characters
that need to be deleted to make the string s beautiful. If the string is
initially beautiful, then output 0 .

Note

In the first test case, for example, you can delete the 4 th and 9 th
characters to make the string beautiful.

In the second test case, the string is already beautiful.

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        s = input()
        x = s.count('map')
        y = s.count('pie')
        print(x + y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6, and the string s consists of lowercase Latin letters with a total length sum not exceeding 10^6.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        s = input()
        
        x = s.count('map')
        
        y = s.count('pie')
        
        print(x + y)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the sum of the counts of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' for each input string \(s\) across all test cases. Each integer corresponds to one test case's result, printed in the order they were processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer `t`, a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in `s`. It then prints the sum of these counts for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - The task is to determine the minimum number of characters that need to be removed from a string `s` to make it "beautiful". A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".
   - The given solution counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" in the string and prints their sum. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for overlapping substrings or the optimal way to remove characters to minimize deletions.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the string "mmapnapie":
     - The solution would count "map" once and "pie" once, resulting in 2 deletions.
     - However, the optimal solution is to delete the 4th and 9th characters, which results in the string "mmnapie", removing only 2 characters but not counting "map" and "pie" separately.
   - For the string "azabazapi":
     - The solution would count "pie" once, resulting in 1 deletion.
     - However, the optimal solution is to keep the string as is since it does not contain "pie" or "map".

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and remove characters such that no "pie" or "map" substrings remain. This involves more complex logic than simply counting occurrences.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided solution is incorrect because it does not handle the removal of characters to form a beautiful string efficiently. It only counts the occurrences of "map" and "pie" without considering the optimal removal strategy.
