Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program counts the occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in the input string `s` and prints their sum. However, the goal is to find the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful, not to count the occurrences of 'map' and 'pie'.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the positions where either 'map' or 'pie' appears and calculate the minimum deletions required to eliminate both substrings completely. The current implementation simply counts the occurrences without considering the optimal deletions.

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
