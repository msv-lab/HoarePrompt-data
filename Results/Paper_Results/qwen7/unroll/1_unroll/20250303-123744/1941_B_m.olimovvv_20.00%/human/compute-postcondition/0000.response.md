Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is a positive integer. Given the constraints, `num_tests` must be at least 1 and at most \(10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- The array `a` consists of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_j \leq 10^9\).
- The sum of the values of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Since the loop is driven by the input value, we need to ensure that the input value (`int(input())`) is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value (`int(input())`), ensuring it is a positive integer within the specified range.

**State:**
**`int(input())` must be a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)**
