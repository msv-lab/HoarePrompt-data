### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if we can make all elements of the array zero by repeatedly applying an operation that reduces `a[i-1]`, `a[i]`, and `a[i+1]` by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.
   - The given code only checks the first and last elements of the array to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero. This is a significant oversight because the operation affects multiple elements simultaneously, and simply checking the first and last elements is insufficient.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The operation reduces the sum of three consecutive elements by 3. Therefore, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 3 for it to be possible to make all elements zero.
   - Additionally, the parity (odd/even nature) of the elements needs to be consistent with the operation's effects. Specifically, if the first or last element is odd and doesn't satisfy the required condition, it cannot be reduced to zero.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The current code correctly identifies some edge cases (first and last elements), but it does not check the overall sum of the array or the consistency of the elements' parities throughout the array.

4. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code checks if `b[0] % 2 == 1` and `b[1] != b[0] + 2` or if `b[-1] % 2 == 1` and `b[-2] != b[-1] + 2`. These checks are necessary but not sufficient.
   - The code does not check if the sum of the array is divisible by 3, which is a critical requirement for the operation to be able to reduce all elements to zero.

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic in the given code does not cover all necessary conditions. It only checks the first and last elements, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making all elements zero.
   - The code does not verify the overall sum of the array or the consistency of the elements' parities.

### Conclusion:
The given code is incorrect because it does not account for the overall sum of the array being divisible by 3, which is a fundamental requirement for the operation to be able to reduce all elements to zero. The current implementation may incorrectly return 'YES' for arrays where it is actually impossible to make all elements zero.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
