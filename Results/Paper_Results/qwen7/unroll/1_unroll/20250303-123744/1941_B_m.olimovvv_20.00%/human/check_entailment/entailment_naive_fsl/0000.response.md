Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions and prints 'NO' if these conditions are met. However, the problem requires checking all elements in the array to ensure they can be reduced to zero using the specified operations.

Consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
5
1 2 3 4 5
5
2 2 2 2 2
4
1 1 1 1
```

The program's output for this input would be:
```
NO
NO
NO
```

However, for the array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it is possible to reduce all elements to zero using the specified operations. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:
1. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 4]`
2. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 2, 1, 0, 2]`
3. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 2, 0, 0, 1]`
4. Apply the operation at `i=4`: `[1, 2, 0, 0, 0]`
5. Apply the operation at `i=3`: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
6. Apply the operation at `i=2`: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

Similarly, for the array `[2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`, it is also possible to reduce all elements to zero using the specified operations.

Therefore, the program incorrectly returns 'NO' for arrays that can indeed be reduced to zero.
