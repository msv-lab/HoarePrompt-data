Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it only checks the first and last elements of the array for specific conditions and prints 'NO' if these conditions are met. However, this approach does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the given operations.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the following points:

1. The operation reduces the sum of the array by a fixed amount (specifically, 4 units per operation).
2. All elements must eventually become zero, which means the initial sum of the array must be divisible by 4.
3. Additionally, the relative differences between consecutive elements must allow for the operations to reduce them to zero.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Check if the sum of the array is divisible by 4
        if sum(b) % 4 != 0:
            print('NO')
        else:
            # Check if the relative differences between consecutive elements allow for reduction to zero
            for i in range(1, n-1):
                if (b[i-1] + 2) % b[i] != 0:
                    print('NO')
                    break
            else:
                print('YES')

func()
```

This corrected program first checks if the sum of the array is divisible by 4. If not, it immediately prints 'NO'. Then, it iterates through the array to check if the relative differences between consecutive elements allow for the operations to reduce them to zero. If any element fails this condition, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
