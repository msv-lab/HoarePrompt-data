Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs through test cases where t (an integer between 1 and 20,000) represents the number of test cases. For each test case, n (an integer between 3 and 300,000) is the length of a string a consisting only of '0' and '1', and the function returns information based on the string a for each test case.**
