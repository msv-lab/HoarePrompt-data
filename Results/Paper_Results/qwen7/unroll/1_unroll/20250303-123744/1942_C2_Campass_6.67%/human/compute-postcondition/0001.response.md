Output State: **`t` is a specific integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `R` is a lambda function that returns a tuple of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer, `t` is now equal to the first element of the tuple returned by `R()`**.

This means that `t` has been assigned the value of the first element in the tuple returned by the lambda function `R()`. The value of `t` is now a specific integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and the lambda function `R` remains unchanged.
