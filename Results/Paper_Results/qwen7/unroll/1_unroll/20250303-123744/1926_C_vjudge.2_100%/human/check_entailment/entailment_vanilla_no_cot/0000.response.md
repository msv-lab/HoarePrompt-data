Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect and inefficient for the given problem:

1. **Precomputation Array Size**: The array `pd` is precomputed with a size of \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\). While this might work for small values of `n`, it's not necessary and can be optimized. The actual maximum value of `n` in the input can be much smaller than \(2 \times 10^5\).

2. **Incorrect Precomputation Logic**: The logic for precomputing the sum of digit sums in the array `pd` is flawed. It should not just accumulate the previous value but rather compute the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `N`.

3. **Time Limit Issue**: Given the constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case, the current approach is inefficient. Precomputing the sum of digit sums up to \(2 \times 10^5\) is unnecessary and will exceed the time limit for multiple test cases.

4. **Redundant Precomputation**: The precomputation step is redundant because the sum of digit sums can be computed directly for each test case without storing intermediate results.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a more efficient and correct solution:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        total_sum += digit_sum
    return total_sum

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))

func()
```

This solution directly computes the sum of digit sums for each number from 1 to `n` during each test case, which is both efficient and straightforward.
