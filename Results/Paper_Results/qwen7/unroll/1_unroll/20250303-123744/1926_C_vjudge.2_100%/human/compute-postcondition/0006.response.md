Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is typically used as a throwaway variable since its value is not used within the loop body. However, the loop itself depends on the value of `t`.

2. **Determine the Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
   - The other variables (`N`, `n`, `pd`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and their values do not change within the loop. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - We need to ensure that `t` is a positive integer for the loop to execute. The initial state already mentions that `t` is an input integer, so we just need to confirm that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be a positive integer**.
