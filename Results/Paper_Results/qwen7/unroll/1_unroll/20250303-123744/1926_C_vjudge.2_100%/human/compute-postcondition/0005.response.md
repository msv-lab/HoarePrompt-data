Output State: `t` is an input integer, `N` is 400001, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `pd` is a list of 400001 elements, each initialized to 0, and after executing the loop, each element `pd[i]` (for 1 ≤ i < N) is the sum of all digits of all numbers from 1 to i.

This means that each `pd[i]` will contain the total sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 up to and including `i`. For example, `pd[3]` would be the sum of the digits of 1, 2, and 3 (which is 6), and `pd[10]` would be the sum of the digits of 1 through 10 (which is 46).
