Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `N` is 400001, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `pd` is a list of 400001 elements, each initialized to 0.**

The code initializes a list `pd` with 400001 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `N`, or `n`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged.
