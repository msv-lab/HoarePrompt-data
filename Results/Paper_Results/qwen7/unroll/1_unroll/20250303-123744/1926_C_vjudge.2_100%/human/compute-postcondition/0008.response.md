Output State: After executing the loop for `t` iterations, the variable `n` will be updated to the value read from input in each iteration, and `pd[n]` will be printed. The list `pd` will remain unchanged, with each element `pd[i]` (for 1 â‰¤ i < N) still representing the sum of all digits of all numbers from 1 to i.
