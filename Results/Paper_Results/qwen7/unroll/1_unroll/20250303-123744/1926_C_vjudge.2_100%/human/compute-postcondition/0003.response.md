Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `N`.
3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `N`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer.
- `N` is 400001.
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `pd` is a list of 400001 elements, each initialized to 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to set the initial value of `i` to 1 (since the loop starts from 1) and ensure that `i` remains less than `N` throughout the loop iterations. 

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the initial value of `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1, `N` is 400001**
