Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases defined by the input integer `t`. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`. The function initializes a list `pd` of size 400001, where each element `pd[i]` represents the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `i`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the required sums for each `n`.**
