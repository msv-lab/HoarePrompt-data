Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \) for multiple test cases.
2. The provided code initializes a large list `pd` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums up to each index.
3. The loop to fill the `pd` array calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to \( N-1 \) (where \( N \) is set to \( 2 \times 10^5 + 1 \)).
4. For each test case, the code correctly uses the precomputed values in `pd` to get the sum of digits for numbers from 1 to \( n \).
5. The approach leverages prefix sums to efficiently compute the desired result for each test case, which is appropriate given the constraints.
6. The code handles multiple test cases as specified by reading `t` and processing each `n` accordingly.
7. There are no logical errors or inefficiencies in the provided implementation that would cause incorrect results.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program appears to be correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
