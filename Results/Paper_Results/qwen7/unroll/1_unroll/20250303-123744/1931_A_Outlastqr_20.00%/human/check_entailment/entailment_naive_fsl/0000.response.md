Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to produce the lexicographically smallest word for certain inputs. For example, for the input `n = 3`, the expected output is `aaa` (since the smallest word with an encoded value of 3 is "aaa"), but the program outputs `"aa" + alphabet[0] + "z"` which results in `"aaz"`. This is incorrect because "aaz" is not the lexicographically smallest word for the input `3`.

To fix this, the program should directly construct the word "aaa" when the input `n` is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), as these are the smallest possible encoded values for a three-letter word.
