Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the constraints for `t` and `n`.
2. The logic for constructing the word based on the encoded value `n` needs to be analyzed:
   - If `n > 52`, the highest possible sum for three letters (`z + z + z = 78`), the word must start with the letter at position `n - 53` and end with 'zz'.
   - If `n > 26`, the word must start with 'a' and the second letter is determined by `n - 28`.
   - Otherwise, the word starts with 'aa' and the third letter is determined by `n - 3`.

3. Let's verify the logic for different values of `n`:
   - For `n = 24`, the word should be "aav" (since `24 - 26 = -2` which falls into the last condition, resulting in "aa" + "v").
   - For `n = 70`, the word should be "rzz" (since `70 - 53 = 17`, so "r" + "zz").
   - For `n = 3`, the word should be "aaa" (since `3 - 3 = 0`, resulting in "aa" + "a").
   - For `n = 55`, the word should be "czz" (since `55 - 28 = 27`, so "c" + "zz").
   - For `n = 48`, the word should be "auz" (since `48 - 28 = 20`, so "a" + "u" + "z").

Given these checks, the logic in the program correctly constructs the lexicographically smallest word for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
