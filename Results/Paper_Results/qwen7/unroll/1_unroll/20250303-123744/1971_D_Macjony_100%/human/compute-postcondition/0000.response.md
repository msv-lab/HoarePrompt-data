Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500, and it is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range, but its specific value will depend on the user's input. The other information about `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code.
