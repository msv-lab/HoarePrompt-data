Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
2. The provided program attempts to solve this by iterating through the string and counting the number of transitions from '0' to '1'.
3. If there is at least one transition from '0' to '1', the count is decremented by one. This logic is based on the observation that each transition from '0' to '1' represents a point where the string can be split to ensure that all '0's come before all '1's after rearrangement.
4. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string is already sorted (either all '0's or all '1's), requiring no cuts.
5. The program also correctly handles strings with multiple transitions, ensuring that each transition is counted appropriately and the final count is adjusted.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
