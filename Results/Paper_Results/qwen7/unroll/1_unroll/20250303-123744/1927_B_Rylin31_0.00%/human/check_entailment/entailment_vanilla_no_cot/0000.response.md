Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Reverse Array Usage**: The `rev_array` is created by reversing the original `array`. However, the logic for generating the string `s` should be based on the cumulative count of previous occurrences, not the reverse count.

2. **Character Selection Logic**: The current implementation uses `alp[rev_array[j:].count(rev_array[j]) - 1]` to select characters, which is incorrect because it doesn't correctly reflect the cumulative count of previous occurrences.

3. **Character Repetition**: The logic for selecting characters does not ensure that the same character is repeated according to the count in the `array`.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        array = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize the result string with 'a'
        result = ['a'] * n
        
        for i in range(n):
            count = array[i]
            if count > 0:
                result[array[i]] = result[i]
        
        print(''.join(result))

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Code:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the result string with 'a' for all positions.
2. **Updating Result String**: For each position `i`, if `array[i]` is greater than 0, we update the corresponding position in the result string to match the character at the position specified by `array[i]`.
3. **Output**: Finally, we join the list into a string and print it.

This approach ensures that the resulting string matches the given trace array correctly.
