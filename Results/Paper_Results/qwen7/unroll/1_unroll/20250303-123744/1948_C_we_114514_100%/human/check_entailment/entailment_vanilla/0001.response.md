Let's analyze the provided Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `n`, `row1`, and `row2`.
   - It checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the movement rules.
   - The function uses a loop to iterate through the first half of the grid (excluding the last column).
   - For each column `i` (from 0 to `half_n - 2`), it checks if the arrow in `row1` at position `2*i + 1` is `<` and if the arrows in `row2` at positions `2*i` or `2*i + 2` are also `<`. If this condition is met, it returns `'No'` because the robot cannot escape to the right.
   - After the loop, it checks the last column separately.
   - If none of the conditions are met, it returns `'Yes'`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
   - It iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2` and calls `func_1` with these values.
   - It collects the results and prints them.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the edge cases where the robot might get stuck due to arrows pointing left.
   - However, the logic only checks for the possibility of getting stuck in the middle of the grid. It does not account for the possibility of the robot reaching the last column via a series of valid moves.

2. **General Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` assumes that if the robot reaches the last column, it will always be able to move to `(2, n)`. This assumption is not entirely correct because the robot must follow the arrows correctly.
   - The function does not handle the case where the robot can navigate through the grid using a combination of left and right movements to reach the last column.

3. **Test Case Verification**:
   - The provided examples show that the function fails to correctly identify some cases where the robot can reach `(2, n)`.
   - For instance, in the fourth example, the function incorrectly returns `'No'` when the robot can actually reach `(2, 6)`.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the provided function `func_1` does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` in all cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
