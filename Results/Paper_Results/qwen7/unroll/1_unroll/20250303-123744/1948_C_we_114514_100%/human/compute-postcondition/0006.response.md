Based on the initial state described, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for each iteration of the loop. Each iteration reads an integer `n`, followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`, and appends the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list. 

However, the function `func_1(n, row1, row2)` is not defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in the `results` list. We only know that each element is the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` for the corresponding input values.

Therefore, the print statement will join the elements of the `results` list into a single string, with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`).

Output: **the results of calling func_1(n, row1, row2) for each iteration, each result on a new line**
