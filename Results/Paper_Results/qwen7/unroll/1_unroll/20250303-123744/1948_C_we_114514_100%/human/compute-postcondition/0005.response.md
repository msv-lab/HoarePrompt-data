Output State: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(n, row1, row2)` with the respective inputs from each iteration of the loop. Each iteration reads an integer `n`, followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`, and appends the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list.
