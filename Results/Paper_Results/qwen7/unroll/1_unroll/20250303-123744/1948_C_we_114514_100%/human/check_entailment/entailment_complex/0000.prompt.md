Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    6
    
    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, row1 is a string consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>', and row2 is a string consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>' representing the first and second rows of the grid respectively. Additionally, n is even.

    #The program returns 'Yes'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5 and n is even), and two strings `row1` and `row2` each consisting of exactly n characters '<' and/or '>'. It checks if it's possible to pair up all characters in `row1` and `row2` such that each '<' in `row1` is paired with a '>' in `row2` and vice versa, forming valid pairs. If such a pairing is possible, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive even integer representing the number of columns in the grid; row1 is a string of length n containing only '<' and '>' characters representing the first row of the grid; row2 is a string of length n containing only '<' and '>' characters representing the second row of the grid.

Each iteration reads an integer `n`, followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`, and appends the result of `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to the `results` list.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by two strings `row1` and `row2`. It then calls `func_1(n, row1, row2)` to compute a result based on the comparison of `row1` and `row2`. Finally, it collects all these results into a list and prints them, each on a new line.
