Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to determine if it's possible to pair up all characters in `row1` and `row2` such that each `<` in `row1` is paired with a `>` in `row2` and vice versa, forming valid pairs.
   - The function iterates through the first half of the grid (up to `half_n - 1`) and checks if there is a conflict where a `<` in `row1` at position `2*i + 1` cannot be paired with a `>` in either `row2[2*i]` or `row2[2*i + 2]`.
   - If such a conflict is found, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - After the loop, it checks the last two cells (`n-1` and `n-2`) of `row1` and `row2` to ensure they do not form a conflicting pair.
   - If no conflicts are found, it returns 'Yes'.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `row1`, and `row2`, and calls `func_1` to get the result.
   - It collects all results in a list and prints them, each on a new line.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly identifies if there is a conflict in the grid that would prevent the robot from reaching `(2, n)`.
   - The function `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as required.
   - Given the constraints and the problem description, the provided functions should work as intended.

Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach cell `(2, n)` based on the grid configuration. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
