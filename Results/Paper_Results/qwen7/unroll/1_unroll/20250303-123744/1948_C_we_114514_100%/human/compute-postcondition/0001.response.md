Output State: **`t` is an input integer, representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, the code updates `t` to be the input integer from the user. The other variables (`n`, `row1`, and `row2`) remain unchanged.
