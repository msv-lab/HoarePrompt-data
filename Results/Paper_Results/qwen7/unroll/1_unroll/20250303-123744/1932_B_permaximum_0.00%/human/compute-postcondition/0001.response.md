State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive**.

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `t` as the condition for the loop to execute.
- Since `t` is specified to be an input integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, this is the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.
- The other part of the loop head (`range(t)`) will generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `t-1`, but the initial value of `t` itself is what determines if the loop should run at all.
