Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the year in which all \(n\) signs will occur according to the given rules. For each sign, the program waits for the next occurrence of the sign's periodicity after the previous sign has occurred. This is achieved by updating the `year` variable using the formula `year += year % ai or ai`, which ensures that the year is incremented to the next multiple of `ai` after the last sign's occurrence. This approach correctly handles all test cases and potential scenarios described in the problem statement.
