Output State: **For each input integer \( t \), there will be \( t \) outputs, each being the result of the computation described in the loop body for the corresponding input list \( a \). Specifically, for each list \( a \), the output is the final value of the variable \( year \) after executing the inner loop. The value of \( year \) is calculated by starting with 0 and then for each element \( ai \) in \( a \), adding \( year \% ai \) or \( ai \) to \( year \).**

This description captures the transformation from the initial state (input integer \( t \) and list \( a \)) to the final state (output of the computed value of \( year \) for each input list \( a \)).
