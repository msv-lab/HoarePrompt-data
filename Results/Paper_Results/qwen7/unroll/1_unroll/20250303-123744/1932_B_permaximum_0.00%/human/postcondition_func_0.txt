The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000). For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of `n` integers `a_i` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). It calculates the final value of `year`, which starts at 0 and is incremented by either `year % a_i` or `a_i` for each element `a_i` in the list. The function prints the final value of `year` for each test case.
