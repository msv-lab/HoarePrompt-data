### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
   - Each tent can hold up to 3 people.
   - Introverts need to be alone in a tent.
   - Extroverts need to be in a tent with exactly 2 others.
   - Universals can be in any type of tent.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
   - The code modifies \(b\) by adding \(c\) to it, i.e., \(b += c\).
   - It then calculates the number of tents using the expression `(a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]`.

3. **Breaking Down the Expression:**
   - The expression `b // 3` calculates the number of full tents needed for extroverts and universals combined.
   - The `- -b // 3` part is redundant because `- -b // 3` simplifies to `b // 3`.
   - The condition `[c < b % 3]` checks if there are any remaining universals that cannot form a complete tent with extroverts.
   - If `c < b % 3`, it returns `-1` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone. Otherwise, it returns the number of tents.

4. **Testing the Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), \(c = 3\)
     - \(b += c \Rightarrow b = 5\)
     - Tents needed: \(1 + \left\lceil \frac{5}{3} \right\rceil = 1 + 2 = 3\)
     - Output: `3`
   - **Case 2:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), \(c = 1\)
     - \(b += c \Rightarrow b = 5\)
     - Tents needed: \(1 + \left\lceil \frac{5}{3} \right\rceil = 1 + 2 = 3\)
     - Output: `-1` (since one extrovert cannot find two others)
   - **Case 3:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), \(c = 2\)
     - \(b += c \Rightarrow b = 6\)
     - Tents needed: \(1 + \left\lceil \frac{6}{3} \right\rceil = 1 + 2 = 3\)
     - Output: `3`
   - **Case 4:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), \(c = 1\)
     - \(b += c \Rightarrow b = 2\)
     - Tents needed: \(1 + \left\lceil \frac{2}{3} \right\rceil = 1 + 1 = 2\)
     - Output: `-1` (since one extrovert cannot find two others)
   - **Case 5:** \(a = 1\), \(b = 3\), \(c = 2\)
     - \(b += c \Rightarrow b = 5\)
     - Tents needed: \(1 + \left\lceil \frac{5}{3} \right\rceil = 1 + 2 = 3\)
     - Output: `3`

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The code correctly handles the logic for calculating the minimum number of tents needed and outputs `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - The code matches the expected behavior as per the problem statement.
