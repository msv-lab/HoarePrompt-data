The function processes a series of test cases, each containing three non-negative integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, it updates \(b\) by adding \(c\) to it and then prints either \(\left(a - \left\lfloor\frac{b}{3}\right\rfloor\right)\) or \(-1\) based on whether \(c\) is less than \(b \mod 3\). After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value.
