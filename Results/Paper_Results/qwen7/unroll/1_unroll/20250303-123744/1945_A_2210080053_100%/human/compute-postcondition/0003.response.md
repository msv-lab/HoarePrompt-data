Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9, representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. After the loop executes all the iterations, for each test case, b has been updated to b + c, and the output prints (a - -b // 3, -1)[c < b % 3]. The values of a and c return to their initial states after each iteration.
