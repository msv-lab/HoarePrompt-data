Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. For each test case, if the number of introverts (a) is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and the values of b and c are also within their specified ranges, the function processes these values but does not return anything explicitly. The function's primary action is to handle and process these test cases according to the given constraints.**
