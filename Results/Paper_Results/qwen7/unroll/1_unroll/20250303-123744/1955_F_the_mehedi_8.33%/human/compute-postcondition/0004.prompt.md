You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, p_i is a list of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, such that the sum of p_i is at least 1.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        if a[0] == a[1] == a[2] and a[0] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        
        print(cnt)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `cnt` is calculated based on the input lists `a`. For each test case, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the first three elements of the list `a` are equal and odd, and then `cnt` is further incremented by half the value of each element in the list, rounded down. The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, it receives a list `p_i` containing four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the initial sequence, respectively, with the sum of `p_i` being at least 1. The function returns information based on the counts in `p_i` for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
