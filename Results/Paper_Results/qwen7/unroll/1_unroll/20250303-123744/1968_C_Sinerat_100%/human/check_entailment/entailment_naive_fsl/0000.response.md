Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all test cases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
4
2 4 1
3
1 5
```

Expected Output:
```
3 5 4 9
2 7 5
```

However, the program generates:
```
3 5 4 9
2 7 5
```

While the first test case is correct, the second test case fails to meet the requirement. For the second test case, the program outputs `2 7 5`, but the correct output should be `2 7 5` (or any other valid sequence). However, the critical issue is that the program does not ensure that `a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = x_i` for all `2 \le i \le n`. In the second test case, `7 \bmod 2 = 1`, but the expected value is `5`. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
