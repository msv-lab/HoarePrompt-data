You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to find an array \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) such that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\). Given the constraints and the nature of the modulo operation, this can be approached by setting \(a_1\) to a large value and then ensuring that subsequent \(a_i\) values satisfy the modulo condition with their preceding values.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function initializes \(a_0\) to 1000.
   - It then iterates through the array `x` and sets each \(a_i\) to \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\).
   - This approach ensures that \(a_i > a_{i-1}\), which is necessary for the modulo operation to yield the required \(x_i\) values.

3. **Verification**:
   - For the first element, \(a_0\) is set to 1000.
   - For the second element, \(a_1 = a_0 + x_0 = 1000 + 2 = 1002\), and \(1002 \bmod 1000 = 2 = x_1\).
   - For the third element, \(a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 1002 + 4 = 1006\), and \(1006 \bmod 1002 = 4 = x_2\).
   - For the fourth element, \(a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = 1006 + 1 = 1007\), and \(1007 \bmod 1006 = 1 = x_3\).

This pattern holds for other test cases as well, ensuring that the generated sequence satisfies the given conditions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution handles the edge case where \(a_1\) is set to 1000, which is a large enough value to ensure the modulo operations yield the required results.
   - The solution also works for different values of \(x_i\) within the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to generate an array \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions.

### Correctness:
**True**
