Reasoning:
1. The program reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it correctly extracts the length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself.
3. The `func_1` function is responsible for decoding the string. It creates an auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters of the encoded string.
4. It then creates a dictionary `mapping` where each character in `r` is paired with its mirrored counterpart in `r`.
5. Finally, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `mapping` dictionary.
6. The program prints the decoded strings for each test case.

Given the problem description and the execution summary, the provided program appears to correctly implement the decoding logic as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
