Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `r` is a string consisting of unique characters from `encoded` sorted in ascending order.**

Explanation: The code `r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))` first creates a set from `encoded`, which removes all duplicate characters. Then, it sorts these unique characters in ascending order and joins them into a string. The length of `encoded` remains unchanged, and the new variable `r` is created with the sorted unique characters from `encoded`.
