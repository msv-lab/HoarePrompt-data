Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to decode the string `b` back to the original string `s`. However, there is a logical error in the `func_1` function that causes it to fail in certain cases. Specifically, the function constructs the mapping from `r` to its reverse but does not handle cases where the encoded string `b` contains characters that do not appear in `r`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate the issue:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  5
  ababa
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  aabba
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  The program fails to produce the correct output because it does not account for the fact that the encoded string might contain characters that do not have a symmetric counterpart in the sorted unique string `r`.

### Detailed Explanation:
1. **Character Set Construction (`r`):**
   - For the input `"ababa"`, the unique characters are `a` and `b`.
   - Sorting these characters gives `r = "ab"`.

2. **Mapping Construction:**
   - The mapping is constructed as `{ 'a': 'b', 'b': 'a' }`.

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - When decoding `"ababa"`, the program replaces each character according to the mapping.
   - However, since both `a` and `b` map to each other, the resulting string would be `"babab"`, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all characters in the encoded string `b` are accounted for in the mapping. This can be achieved by extending the mapping to include characters that do not appear in `r` but are present in `b`.

Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i + 1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Extend the mapping to handle characters not in r
    extended_mapping = {}
    for char in encoded:
        if char in mapping:
            extended_mapping[char] = mapping[char]
        else:
            # Handle characters not in r (they remain unchanged)
            extended_mapping[char] = char
    
    return ''.join((extended_mapping[char] for char in encoded))
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
