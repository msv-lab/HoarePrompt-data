Output State: `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is a list containing `[2 ** 0, 2 ** 1, 2 ** 2, ..., 2 ** (lk - 2)]`, `lk` is the length of `bk`

In simpler terms, after the loop executes, `ans` will contain a list of powers of 2 starting from \(2^0\) up to \(2^{lk-2}\), where `lk` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `k`.
