Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n` but not equal to 1, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, `ans` is an empty list, `lk` is the length of `bk`**.

Explanation: The code `lk = len(bk)` calculates the length of the binary representation of `k` (without the '0b' prefix) and assigns it to the variable `lk`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
