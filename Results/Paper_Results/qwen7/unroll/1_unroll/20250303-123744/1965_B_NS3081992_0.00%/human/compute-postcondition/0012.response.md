Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `l`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 2 to `l` (exclusive). This means `i` starts at 2 and goes up to but does not include `l`.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `l`**:
   - The variable `i` should start at 2 for the loop to begin its first iteration.
   - The variable `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.

4. **Check the given state**:
   - `ans` is [2, 3] (this is not relevant to the loop head).
   - `b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix.
   - `k` is 1 and remains an integer between 1 and `n`.
   - `l` is the length of `b`.
   - `n` is not equal to 2.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` should start at 2, we need to ensure `i` is 2.
   - `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n`, so we need to ensure `l` is set correctly based on the value of `n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `l`.

**Final State**:
- `i` is 2
- `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` (without the '0b' prefix)

So, the final answer is:

State: **`i` is 2, `l` is the length of the binary representation of `n` (without the '0b' prefix)**
