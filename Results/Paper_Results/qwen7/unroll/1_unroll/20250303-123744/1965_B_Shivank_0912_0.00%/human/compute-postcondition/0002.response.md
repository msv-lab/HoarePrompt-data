Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head in this case involves the tuple `(n, k)` from the list `cases`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `cases` list. Each element in `cases` is a tuple `(n, k)` where `2 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= k <= n`.

3. **Adjust the states of the relevant objects**:
   - `cases`: This list must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute.
   - `n` and `k`: These values will be taken from the tuple `(n, k)` in each iteration.

4. **Other variables**:
   - `t`, `results`, and `sequence` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `cases` must contain at least one tuple.
- `n` and `k` will be the first elements of the tuple in `cases`.

Therefore, the final state should be:

**State: **`cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least one tuple, `n` is the first element of the first tuple in `cases`, `k` is the second element of the first tuple in `cases`**.
