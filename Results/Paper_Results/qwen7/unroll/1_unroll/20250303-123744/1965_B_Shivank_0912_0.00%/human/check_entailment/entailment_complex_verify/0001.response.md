### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. It then processes this data to extract the number of test cases (`t`) and the pairs of integers (`n` and `k`) for each test case. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Generating Sequences**: The function `func_1` generates a fixed sequence of length 25, where each element is a power of 2 (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, 8, ..., 2^24]`). This sequence is used for every test case. This part of the program is also correct.

3. **Conditions Check**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: The sequence consists of powers of 2, which means no subsequence can sum to an odd number if `k` is odd. However, if `k` is even, the sequence can still include `k` as a sum because the sequence includes `2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^24`, and any even number can be formed by summing appropriate powers of 2. For example, `2 = 2^1`, `4 = 2^2`, etc. Therefore, the condition that there is no subsequence summing to `k` is not always met.
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`**: Given the nature of powers of 2, any positive integer can be represented uniquely as a sum of distinct powers of 2. Therefore, the sequence can form all sums from 1 to `n-1` (since `k` is excluded). This part is correct.

4. **Output Formatting**: The program prints the length of the sequence (25) and the sequence itself for each test case. This part is correct.

### Conclusion:
The program does not always meet the requirement that there is no subsequence of the sequence with a sum of `k`. Specifically, if `k` is an even number, the sequence can still include `k` as a sum, violating the condition that there is no subsequence summing to `k`.

### Correctness:
**False**

**False**
