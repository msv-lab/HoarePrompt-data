Output State: **`n` is assigned the value read from input, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are integers, `y[0] to y[n-1]` are integers, `r[0]` to `r[n-1]` are integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `tot` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, or `coef`. The only new information is that `tot` is now 0.
