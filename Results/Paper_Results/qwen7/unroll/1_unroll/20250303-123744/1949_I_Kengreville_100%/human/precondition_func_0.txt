n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. x, y, and r are lists of length n where each element is a tuple (x[i], y[i], r[i]) representing the coordinates (x, y) and radius r of the i-th disk. visited is a list of boolean values of length n indicating whether a disk has been visited during the DFS process. coef is a list of floating-point numbers of length n used to store coefficients during the DFS process. tot is an integer used to accumulate the number of disks visited in the current component. bipartite is a boolean flag used to check if the current component is bipartite.
