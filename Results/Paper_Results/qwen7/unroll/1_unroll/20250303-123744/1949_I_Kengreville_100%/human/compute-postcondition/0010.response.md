Output State: **`bipartite` is True, `n` is the value read from input, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `x[0]` to `x[n-1]` are integers, `y[0] to y[n-1]` are integers, `r[0]` to `r[n-1]` are integers, `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `coef` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `tot` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `bipartite = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `bipartite`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
