Based on the initial state provided:

- `bipartite` is `True`.
- `n` is a value read from input.
- `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input.
- `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input.
- `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` (indicating every node will be visited at least once).
- `coef` is a list of length `n` where each element is either `1` or `None` (set to `1` during the first visit of each component).
- `tot` is `0`.
- `ok` is `True`.

The print statement in question is:

```python
print('YES')
```

This statement directly prints the string `'YES'` without referencing any variables or objects whose values would change the output.

Output: **YES**
