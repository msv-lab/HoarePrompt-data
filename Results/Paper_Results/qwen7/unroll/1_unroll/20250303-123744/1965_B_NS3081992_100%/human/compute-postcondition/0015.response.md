Output State: **`b` is the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, `k` is the second return value of `func_7()`, `bk` is the binary representation of `k` without the '0b' prefix, `l` is the length of `b`, and `ans` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `ans`. No changes are made to the values of `b`, `k`, `bk`, or `l`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
