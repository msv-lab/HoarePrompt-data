Output State: **`ans` is `[2, 3]`, `k` is 1, `l` is the length of `b`, `n` is not equal to 2**

Explanation: The line `ans = [2, 3]` assigns the list `[2, 3]` to the variable `ans`. The values of `k`, `l`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. `k` is still the second return value of `func_7()`, `l` is still the length of `b`, and `n` is still not equal to 2.
