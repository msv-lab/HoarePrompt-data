Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns either the string '1\n2' or a string representing the length of the list `ans` followed by the elements of `ans` joined by spaces. If `k` is 1 and `n` is not 2, it returns '1\n2'. Otherwise, it constructs a list `ans` containing specific values based on the binary representation of `n` and the value of `k`, and then returns the length of this list along with its elements formatted as described.**
