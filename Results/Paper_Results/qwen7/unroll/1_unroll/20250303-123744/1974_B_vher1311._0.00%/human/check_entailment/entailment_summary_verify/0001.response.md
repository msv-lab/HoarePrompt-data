### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and the function `func_1` to determine if it correctly implements the decoding logic.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters of the original string `s` in alphabetical order.
- Each character in the original string `s` is then replaced by its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

#### Decoding Process:
- To decode, we need to reverse this process:
  - Create the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b` by identifying the unique characters and sorting them alphabetically.
  - Replace each character in `b` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function aims to create the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b` and then replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
   - However, the implementation has several issues:
     - It uses `s.replace(char, unique_chars[j])`, which is incorrect because `s` is a string and replacing characters in a string is not straightforward.
     - It attempts to modify `unique_chars` by inserting characters, which is unnecessary and incorrect for the decoding process.

2. **Correct Implementation:**
   - We need to create the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string `b`.
   - For each character in `b`, find its symmetric counterpart in `r` and construct the decoded string.

#### Corrected Implementation:
```python
def func_1(s):
    # Step 1: Create the auxiliary string r with unique characters of s in alphabetical order
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    
    # Step 2: Create the decoded string
    decoded_str = []
    for char in s:
        index = len(unique_chars) - unique_chars.index(char) - 1
        decoded_str.append(unique_chars[index])
    
    return ''.join(decoded_str)
```

#### Evaluation:
- The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the decoding logic as described in the original assessment.
- The original assessment correctly identified that the function `func_1` does not properly handle the decoding process.

However, the original assessment concluded that the entire program is incorrect, which is not entirely accurate. The issue lies specifically in the function `func_1`, not in the overall structure of the program.

#### Final Evaluation:
- The program structure is correct, but the function `func_1` needs to be fixed.
- Therefore, the original assessment is partially correct but overly broad.

**Final: False**

The program is not entirely incorrect, but the function `func_1` needs to be corrected to properly implement the decoding logic.
