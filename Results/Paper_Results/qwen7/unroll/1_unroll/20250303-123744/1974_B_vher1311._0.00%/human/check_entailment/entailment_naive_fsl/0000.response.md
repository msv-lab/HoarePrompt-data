Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. The issue lies in the `func_1` function. Instead of replacing characters in the original string `s` with their symmetric counterparts from the auxiliary string `unique_chars`, the function incorrectly modifies `unique_chars` itself. This results in the decoded string being incorrect.

For example, consider the input:
- Test case: `n = 10`, `b = "serofedsoc"`

The correct decoding process should be:
1. Construct the auxiliary string `r = "cdefors"`.
2. Replace each character in `b` with its symmetric counterpart from `r`.

However, the provided function does not perform this correctly. It tries to replace characters in `s` with characters from `unique_chars`, but it does not handle the symmetric replacement properly.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(s):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(s))
    char_map = {char: unique_chars[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
    return ''.join(char_map[char] for char in s)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        b = input()
        decoded_str = func_1(b)
        print(decoded_str)
```

This corrected function creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each unique character to its symmetric counterpart and then uses this map to decode the string `b`.
