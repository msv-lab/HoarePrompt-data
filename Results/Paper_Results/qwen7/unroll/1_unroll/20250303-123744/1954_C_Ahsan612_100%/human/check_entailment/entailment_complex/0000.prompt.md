Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are strings representing integers of the same length, consisting of digits from 1 to 9.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        
        new = [None] * len(a)
        
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < len(a) and a[i] == b[i]:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i != len(a):
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
            while i < len(a):
                new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
                new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
                i += 1
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
        
        print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))
        
    #State: Output State: The output state consists of two strings of digits, each of the same length as the input strings `x` and `y`. For each position in these strings:
    #
    #- The first string (from the `new` list) contains the maximum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit thereafter.
    #- The second string (from the `new2` list) contains the minimum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit thereafter.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes two input strings, `x` and `y`, which represent integers of the same length consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It prints two new strings. The first string contains the maximum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the minimum digit thereafter. The second string contains the minimum digit between the corresponding digits of `x` and `y` up to the point where the digits differ, and then the maximum digit thereafter. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the two new strings.
