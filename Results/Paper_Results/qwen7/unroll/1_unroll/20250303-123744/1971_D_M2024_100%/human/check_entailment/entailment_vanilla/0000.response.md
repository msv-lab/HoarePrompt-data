### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum number of cuts required to split the binary string into pieces that can be rearranged into a sorted binary string (i.e., all `0`s followed by all `1`s).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters, `cut0` and `cut1`, to count the number of transitions from `0` to `1` and from `1` to `0`, respectively.
   - It iterates through the string, checking for transitions between adjacent characters.
   - If there are no transitions from `0` to `1` (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis**:
   - **Case 1: No Transitions from `0` to `1`**:
     - If there are no transitions from `0` to `1`, the string is either all `0`s or all `1`s. In this case, the entire string can be considered one piece, so the answer should be `1`.
     - The code correctly handles this case by printing `cut1 + 1`, which will be `0 + 1 = 1`.

   - **Case 2: Transitions from `0` to `1` Exist**:
     - If there are transitions from `0` to `1`, the string must be split at each transition point to ensure all `0`s come before all `1`s.
     - The code correctly counts these transitions and prints `cut0 + cut1`, which gives the total number of cuts needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles strings that are already sorted (all `0`s or all `1`s).
   - The code also correctly handles strings with multiple transitions from `0` to `1`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The logic in the given code accurately determines the minimum number of cuts required to sort the binary string.
