Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the binary string into a sorted binary string. Specifically, the logic for counting `cut0` and `cut1` is flawed. The program counts transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', but it does not account for the fact that the entire string might be already sorted or can be split into fewer pieces.

For example, consider the input string "010101". The program would incorrectly count two cuts (`cut0` and `cut1`), leading to a result of 3 pieces, which is not the minimum required. The correct answer should be 2 pieces, as the string can be split into "010" and "101".

A correct approach would involve counting the number of '1's before the first '0' and after the last '0', and then determining the minimum cuts based on these counts.
