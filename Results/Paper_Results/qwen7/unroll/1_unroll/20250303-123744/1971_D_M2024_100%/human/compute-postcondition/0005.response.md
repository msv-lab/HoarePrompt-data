Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a binary string `s`. For each test case, it counts the number of "01" and "10" pairs in the binary string `s`. If no "01" pairs are found, it prints the count of "10" pairs plus one. Otherwise, it prints the sum of the counts of "01" and "10" pairs. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
