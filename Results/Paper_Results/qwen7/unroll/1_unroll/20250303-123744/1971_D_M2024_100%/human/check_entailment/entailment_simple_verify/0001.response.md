### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of pieces to cut a binary string into so that the pieces can be rearranged to form a sorted binary string.
   - A sorted binary string means all '0's come before all '1's.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the binary string `a`.
   - It initializes two counters `cut0` and `cut1` to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0', respectively.
   - It iterates through the string to count these transitions.
   - If there are no transitions from '0' to '1' (`cut0 == 0`), it prints `cut1 + 1`. Otherwise, it prints `cut0 + cut1`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** If there are no transitions from '0' to '1', it means the string is already sorted. In this case, we need to count the number of pieces that contain at least one '1'. However, the logic here is flawed because it only considers the number of '10' transitions. The correct approach would be to count the number of '0' blocks plus one (since the last block will always be a '1' block). This is not correctly handled by `cut1 + 1`.
   - **Case 2:** If there are transitions from '0' to '1', the string is not sorted. Each transition indicates a boundary where a piece ends and another begins. Therefore, the number of pieces required is the sum of the transitions from '0' to '1' and from '1' to '0'. This is correctly handled by `cut0 + cut1`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles strings with no transitions correctly in terms of counting '10' transitions, but it fails to account for the number of '0' blocks plus one.
   - The program handles strings with multiple transitions correctly.
   - The program does not handle cases where the string starts or ends with '1' or '0' separately, but this is not necessary since the logic correctly counts the transitions.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string. Specifically, it fails to count the number of '0' blocks plus one when the string is already sorted.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
