Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city for each city in the list `cities`. However, the implementation does not correctly identify the closest city but instead initializes a list of `n-1` ones. This is incorrect because it does not follow the logic required to find the closest city based on the given problem constraints.
   - The function should iterate through each city and compare the distances to the next and previous cities to determine the closest one. It should then store the index of the closest city for each city in a new list.

2. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program attempts to solve the problem by calculating prefix sums of the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists. However, these lists are incorrectly initialized due to the faulty `func_1` function.
   - The logic for calculating the minimum cost to travel between two cities using the prefix sums is also flawed because the `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` lists do not contain the correct information about the closest cities.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Given the example input, the expected output is calculated based on the correct logic of finding the closest city and then determining the minimum cost. However, the provided program does not implement this logic correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it fails to properly identify the closest city for each city and uses this incorrect information to compute the prefix sums and ultimately the minimum cost for each query.

Correctness: **False**
