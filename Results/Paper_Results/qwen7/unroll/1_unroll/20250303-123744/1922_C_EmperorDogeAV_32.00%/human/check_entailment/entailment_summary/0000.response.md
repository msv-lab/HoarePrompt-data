Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the closest city for each city and using this information to calculate the minimum cost of travel.
2. The provided `func_1` function is designed to determine the closest city for each city except the first and last. It iterates through the list of cities and compares the distances to the next and previous cities.
3. Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the function should correctly identify the closest city for each city. However, the implementation in `func_1` has a flaw: it incorrectly calculates the distance to the closest city and does not properly handle the logic for setting the values in `prog_cities`.
4. The execution summary states that the function returns a list of \( n-1 \) ones, which is incorrect. Based on the problem statement, the function should return a list where each element (except the first and last) is either 1 (if the next city is closer) or the absolute difference in coordinates (which should be greater than 1).
5. The main program logic seems to be correct after the preprocessing step. It calculates prefix sums for forward and backward travel and uses these to answer the queries efficiently.

Given the above reasoning, the function `func_1` is incorrect because it does not properly determine the closest city. Therefore, the overall program is incorrect due to this fundamental flaw.

Correctness: **False**
