You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, and n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999
        
        forward = 99999999
        
        if i > 0:
            back = cities[i - 1]
        
        if i < n - 1:
            forward = cities[i + 1]
        
        if abs(forward - cities[i]) < abs(cities[i] - back):
            prog_cities[i] = 1
        else:
            prog_cities[i] = abs(forward - cities[i])
        
    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, and `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through each city (except the first and last) and compares the distance to the next city with the distance to the previous city. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference in coordinates, which will always be larger than 1 based on the problem constraints. Since the cities are in ascending order, the distance to the next city will always be less than the distance to the previous city, leading to `prog_cities[i]` being set to 1 for all valid indices.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, and `n`, which is an integer indicating the number of cities. The function returns a list of `n - 1` ones.

```

Return Postconditions: `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` ones


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
