Output State: **`cities` is a list of integers representing the coordinates of n cities in ascending order, and `n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5; `prog_cities` is a list of `n - 1` zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes `prog_cities` as a list of `n - 1` zeros using the list multiplication operator `[0] * (n - 1)`. This operation does not affect the `cities` list or the value of `n`. Therefore, the `cities` list remains unchanged, and `prog_cities` is a new list consisting of `n - 1` elements, each set to zero.
