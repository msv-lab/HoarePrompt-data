Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `cities` representing the coordinates of \( n \) cities in ascending order and an integer \( n \) indicating the number of cities. After processing, it returns a list of \( n - 1 \) ones. Specifically, for each city except the first and last, it checks the distance to the next city versus the previous city. If the distance to the next city is smaller, it sets the corresponding position in the output list to 1; otherwise, it sets it to the absolute difference in coordinates, which will always be greater than 1 given the problem constraints. Since the cities are in ascending order, the distance to the next city is always less, resulting in all positions in the output list being set to 1.**
