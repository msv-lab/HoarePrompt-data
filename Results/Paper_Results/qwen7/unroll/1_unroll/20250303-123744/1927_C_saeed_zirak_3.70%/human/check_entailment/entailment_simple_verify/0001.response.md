### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variables Initialization**: The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are correctly initialized from the input. The variable `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which is also correct.

3. **Counters Initialization**: The counters `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These counters are used to keep track of how many elements from each array have been chosen up to `i`.

4. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to k**: The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `k`. For each number `i`:
   - It checks if `i` exists in both arrays `a` and `b`.
   - If `i` exists in both arrays, it increments the counter of the array with fewer chosen elements (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
   - If `i` exists in only one array, it increments the counter of that array if the count is less than or equal to `newk`.
   - If `i` does not exist in either array and the count of chosen elements from that array is already greater than `newk`, the loop breaks.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles the edge cases where a number might not exist in either array, and it ensures that the chosen elements cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the logic of the loop. Specifically, the loop assumes that if a number `i` exists in both arrays, it will always be added to the array with fewer chosen elements. This assumption is flawed because it does not ensure that the chosen elements will cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

Consider the following example:
- `a = [2, 3, 8, 5, 6, 5]`
- `b = [1, 3, 4, 10, 5]`
- `k = 6`

In this case, the loop will handle the number `3` as follows:
- `3` is in both `a` and `b`.
- Initially, `aOnes = 0` and `bOnes = 0`.
- Since `aOnes < bOnes`, `aOnes` is incremented to `1`.
- Next, the loop will handle `4`, which is only in `b`.
- Since `bOnes < newk`, `bOnes` is incremented to `1`.
- Then, the loop will handle `5`, which is in both `a` and `b`.
- Since `aOnes >= bOnes`, the loop breaks.

At the end of the loop, `aOnes = 1` and `bOnes = 1`, but we need `aOnes = 3` and `bOnes = 3` to cover all numbers from 1 to 6. Therefore, the program incorrectly determines that it is possible to choose the required elements.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays such that all numbers from 1 to `k` are included. The logic fails to ensure that all numbers from 1 to `k` are covered, especially when numbers exist in both arrays.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
