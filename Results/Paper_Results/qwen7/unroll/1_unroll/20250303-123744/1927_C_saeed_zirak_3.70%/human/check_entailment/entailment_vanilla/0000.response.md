### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Variables Initialization**: The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are correctly initialized from the input. The variable `newk` is set to `k // 2`, which is also correct.

3. **Counters Initialization**: The counters `aOnes` and `bOnes` are initialized to zero. These counters are used to keep track of how many elements from each array have been chosen up to `i`.

4. **Loop Through Numbers from 1 to k**: The loop iterates through numbers from 1 to `k`. For each number `i`:
   - It checks if `i` exists in both arrays `a` and `b`.
   - If `i` exists in both arrays, it increments the counter of the array with fewer chosen elements (`aOnes` or `bOnes`).
   - If `i` exists in only one array, it increments the counter of that array if the count is less than or equal to `newk`.
   - If `i` does not exist in either array and the count of chosen elements from that array is already greater than `newk`, the loop breaks.

5. **Final Check**: After the loop, it checks if both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`. If they are, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

6. **Edge Cases**: The logic handles the edge cases where a number might not exist in either array, and it ensures that the chosen elements cover all numbers from 1 to `k`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to choose exactly `k/2` elements from both arrays such that all numbers from 1 to `k` are included. The program follows the problem description accurately and handles all given examples correctly.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
