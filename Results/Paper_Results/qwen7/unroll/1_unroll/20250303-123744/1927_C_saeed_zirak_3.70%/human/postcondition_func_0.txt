The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \), along with two lists \( a \) and \( b \). For each test case, it checks whether it is possible to select exactly \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from list \( a \) and \( \frac{k}{2} \) elements from list \( b \) such that the selected elements are the same in both lists. If such a selection is possible, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the result for each test case.
