t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m), and k is even. a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6]. It is guaranteed that the sum of values n and m over all test cases in a test does not exceed 4⋅10^5.
