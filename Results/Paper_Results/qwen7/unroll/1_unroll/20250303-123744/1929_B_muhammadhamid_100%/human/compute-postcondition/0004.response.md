Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions. If \( k \) is 1, it prints 1. If \( k \) is less than or equal to \( 2 \times (n + (n - 2)) \), it prints \( \lceil \frac{k}{2} \rceil \). Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{k}{2} + 1 \). The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, followed by pairs of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.**
