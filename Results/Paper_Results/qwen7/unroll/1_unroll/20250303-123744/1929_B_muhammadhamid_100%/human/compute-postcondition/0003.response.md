Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes variables t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers within specific ranges (2 <= n <= 10^8 and 1 <= k <= 4n - 2). It returns a value based on the conditions specified for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with `t` being a positive integer within the range of 1 to 1000, and `n` and `k` being integers where `n` ranges from 2 to \(10^8\) and `k` ranges from 1 to \(4n - 2\). The function's output depends on the values of `n` and `k` according to the given constraints.
