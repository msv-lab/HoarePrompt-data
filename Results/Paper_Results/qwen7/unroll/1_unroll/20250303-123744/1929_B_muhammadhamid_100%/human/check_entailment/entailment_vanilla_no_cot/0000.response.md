Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases as per the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to determine the minimum number of cells to color is flawed. Let's break down why:

1. **Edge Cases Not Handled Properly**: The solution does not consider all possible configurations and minimum requirements for coloring cells such that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.

2. **Incorrect Formula Usage**: The formula `math.ceil(k / 2)` and `k // 2 + 1` do not always yield the correct result. For example, in the case where `k` is very close to `4n - 2`, the solution might not provide the optimal number of cells to color.

3. **General Logic Flaw**: The logic does not account for the fact that some diagonals overlap, and the minimum number of cells needed might be less than `k / 2` in certain scenarios.

To properly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

- **Minimum Diagonals**: We need to ensure that at least `k` diagonals have at least one colored cell.
- **Optimal Coloring Strategy**: We should aim to color the fewest cells while satisfying the condition.

Hereâ€™s a more accurate approach to solving the problem:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        # Calculate the minimum number of cells needed
        min_cells = max(k // 2, n)
        print(min_cells)

func()
```

This approach ensures that we color at least `n` cells, which is often the optimal strategy to cover the required diagonals. The `max(k // 2, n)` ensures that we meet the requirement of covering at least `k` diagonals while minimizing the number of cells colored.
