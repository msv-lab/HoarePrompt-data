Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns information about the hidden permutation \( p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} \) by comparing the bitwise OR of pairs of elements through up to \(3n\) queries.**

This means the function can query the bitwise OR of elements at specified indices in the hidden permutation to gather information about the permutation without directly accessing its values.
