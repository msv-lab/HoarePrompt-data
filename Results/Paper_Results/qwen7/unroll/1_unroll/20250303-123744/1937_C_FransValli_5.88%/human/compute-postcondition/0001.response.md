Output State: The value of `k` is set to the smallest index `i` such that the bitwise OR of `p_0` and `p_i` is less than the bitwise OR of `p_k` and `p_i`. The value of `best` is set to the smallest index `i` (where `i > k`) such that the bitwise OR of `p_k` and `p_best` is less than the bitwise OR of `p_k` and `p_i`. The final output prints these two values `k` and `best`.
