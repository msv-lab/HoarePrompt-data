Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The variable `_` is used as a placeholder and does not hold any specific value within the loop. Instead, the loop iterates based on the integer value obtained from `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - The loop will execute as long as the integer value obtained from `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of the input that will be read by `int(input())`.

### Conclusion:

To ensure the loop can execute, the input value must be greater than 0. We need to adjust the state such that the input value is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:

State: **The input value must be greater than 0**.
