Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `u2vs` is a list of `n` empty lists where each list contains its adjacent nodes based on user inputs, `d` is a list of integers representing the shortest distance from node 0 to each node, `previous` is a list of integers representing the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, `a` is the return value from `func_1(d)`, and the BFS function has been called with `a` as the argument.**

In this output state, the variable `d` remains unchanged, meaning it still holds the shortest distances from node 0 to each node. The variable `previous` is now a list that holds the previous node in the shortest path from node 0 to each node, which is the result of calling the BFS function with `a` as the argument. The variable `a` retains its value from the return of `func_1(d)`. The initial state of `n`, `u2vs`, and the structure of `d` remain unchanged.
