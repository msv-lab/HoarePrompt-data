State: **`cases` must be greater than 0, `c` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for c in range(cases):` will execute as long as `cases` is a positive integer greater than 0.
2. The variable `c` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.
3. Other variables like `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a`, `b` are not involved in the loop condition and their initial values do not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `cases` must be greater than 0, and `c` is set to 0 at the beginning of each iteration.
