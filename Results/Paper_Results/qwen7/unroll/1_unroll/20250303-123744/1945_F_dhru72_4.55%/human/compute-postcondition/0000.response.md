Output State: **T is a type variable named T, and the initial values of `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.**

Explanation: The line `T = TypeVar('T')` defines a type variable named `T` using Python's `typing` module. This does not assign any specific value to `T` or change the values of `t`, `n`, `v`, or `p`. Therefore, the initial conditions for these variables remain the same.
