Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each `t`, it processes pairs of integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6) such that the sum of all `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function returns results based on these inputs for each test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle a series of test cases, each containing a value `t`, followed by `t` pairs of integers `n` and `m`. For each pair, the function processes the values according to the given constraints and produces a result, which could be a calculation, validation, or any operation based on `n` and `m`. The function ensures that the total count of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed a specified limit.
