Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Valid Pairs**:
   - The program attempts to calculate the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
   - However, the logic inside the `while` loop is flawed. It does not correctly account for the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\).

2. **Simplification and Incorrect Assumptions**:
   - The program simplifies the problem by assuming a pattern that doesn't hold true for all cases. Specifically, it incorrectly increments the count of valid pairs based on the value of `g` without properly checking the gcd condition.

3. **Test Case Verification**:
   - For the given example test cases, the output produced by the program does not match the expected results. For instance, for the test case `(10, 8)`, the expected output is `14`, but the program outputs a different value.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to iterate through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the condition \(a + b \mod (b \cdot \gcd(a, b)) == 0\). Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from math import gcd

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        for a in range(1, n + 1):
            for b in range(1, m + 1):
                if (a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                    count += 1
        print(count)

func()
```

This approach iterates through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks the condition directly, ensuring correctness.
