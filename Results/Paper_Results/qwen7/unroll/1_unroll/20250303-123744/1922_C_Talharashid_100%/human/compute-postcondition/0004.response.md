Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, a list of n integers a, an integer m, and m queries consisting of pairs of integers (x, y). It then computes two dictionaries, d1 and d2, based on the differences between consecutive elements in the list a. Finally, it outputs the results of the queries, printing the value of d1[y] - d1[x] if y > x, and d2[y] - d2[x] otherwise.**
