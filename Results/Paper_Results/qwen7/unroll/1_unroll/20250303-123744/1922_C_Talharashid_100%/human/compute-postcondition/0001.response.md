Output State: The output state consists of the values of `d1` and `d2` dictionaries computed for each test case, followed by the results of `m` queries for each test case. Specifically, for each query `(x, y)` where `y > x`, the result is `d1[y] - d1[x]`, and for each query `(x, y)` where `y < x`, the result is `d2[y] - d2[x]`.
