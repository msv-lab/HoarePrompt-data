Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, where `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`. After performing some comparisons and counting operations, it calculates two values, `ans` and `ans1`, and prints the maximum of these two values for each test case. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` for the corresponding test case.**
