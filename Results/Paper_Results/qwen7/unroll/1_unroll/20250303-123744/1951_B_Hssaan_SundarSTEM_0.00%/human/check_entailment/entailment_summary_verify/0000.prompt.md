You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

[The HU - Shireg Shireg](https://youtu.be/SNCx4n2m5_o)

ඞ

There are n cows participating in a coding tournament. Cow i has a Cowdeforces
rating of a_i (all distinct), and is initially in position i . The tournament
consists of n-1 matches as follows:

  * The first match is between the cow in position 1 and the cow in position 2 . 
  * Subsequently, each match i is between the cow in position i+1 and the winner of match i-1 . 
  * In each match, the cow with the higher Cowdeforces rating wins and proceeds to the next match. 

You are the owner of cow k . For you, winning the tournament is not important;
rather, you want your cow to win in as many matches as possible. As an
acquaintance of the tournament organizers, you can ask them to swap the
position of your cow with another cow only once, or you can choose to do
nothing.

Find the maximum number of wins your cow can achieve.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le n \le
10^5, 1 \le k \le n ) — the number of cows and your cow's index.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the Cowdeforces rating of the cows. It is guaranteed that
a_i 's are pairwise different.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the maximum number of wins cow k can
achieve if you choose to swap (or do nothing) optimally.

Example

Input

    3
    
    6 1
    
    12 10 14 11 8 3
    
    6 5
    
    7 2 727 10 12 13
    
    2 2
    
    1000000000 1

Output

    1
    2
    0
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal to do nothing. Let a' be the Cowdeforces
rating of the cows in the original order (with your cow's rating bolded), then

  * Initially, a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 14, 11, 8, 3] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 14 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 1 match.

In the second test case, it is optimal to swap your cow to position 3 . Then,
let a' be the Cowdeforces rating of the cows in the order after the swap.

  * Initially, a' = [7, 2, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 2 and wins. a' = [7, \mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * The cow with Cowdeforces rating 7 plays against your cow, and your cow wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 10, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 10 and wins. a' = [\mathbf{12}, 727, 13] . 
  * Your cow plays against the cow with Cowdeforces rating 727 and loses. 

In total, your cow wins 2 matches.

- Program:
import math as m

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(map(int, input().split()))
        (s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])
        ans = 0
        h = s[0]
        j = -1
        for i in s[1:]:
            j += 1
            if h < i:
                break
            else:
                ans += 1
        p = j
        (s[0], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[0])
        ans1 = 0
        (s[p], s[k - 1]) = (s[k - 1], s[p])
        z = 0
        for i in s:
            if i == h:
                if s[0] != h:
                    ans1 += 1
                z = 1
            elif i > h:
                break
            elif z == 1:
                ans1 += 1
        print(max(ans, ans1))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, where `t` represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `s` of `n` distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of the list with the element at index `k-1`. After performing some comparisons and counting operations, it calculates two values, `ans` and `ans1`, and prints the maximum of these two values for each test case. The final output consists of `t` lines, each containing the maximum value between `ans` and `ans1` for the corresponding test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program does not consider the scenario where swapping the cow at position `k` with another cow can potentially allow the cow to win more matches. Here is an example to demonstrate this issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3
4 2
5 3 7 2
4 3
5 3 7 2
4 4
5 3 7 2
```

For the first test case:
- Original order: `[5, 3, 7, 2]`
- Cow at position 2 has a rating of 3.
- Swapping cow at position 2 with cow at position 4 results in: `[5, 2, 7, 3]`
- Cow at position 2 (now with rating 2) wins the first match against cow at position 1 (rating 5).
- Cow at position 2 (still with rating 2) loses the second match against cow at position 3 (rating 7).

So, the cow at position 2 can win 1 match by swapping.

However, the program does not consider this scenario. Instead, it simply swaps the cow at position `k` with the cow at position 1 and checks the number of wins. This approach may miss out on scenarios where swapping with another cow can lead to more wins.

For instance, in the second test case:
- Original order: `[5, 3, 7, 2]`
- Cow at position 3 has a rating of 7.
- Swapping cow at position 3 with cow at position 4 results in: `[5, 3, 2, 7]`
- Cow at position 3 (now with rating 2) loses the first match against cow at position 1 (rating 5).
- Cow at position 3 (still with rating 7) wins the second match against cow at position 2 (rating 3).

So, the cow at position 3 can win 1 match by swapping, but the program incorrectly calculates it as 0.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and fails to maximize the number of wins for the cow at position `k`.
