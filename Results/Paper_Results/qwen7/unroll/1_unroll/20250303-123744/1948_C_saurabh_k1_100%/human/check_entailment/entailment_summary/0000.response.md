Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking specific conditions to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). However, the logic used in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program only checks for certain patterns involving the character '<' in the two input strings and incorrectly concludes whether the robot can reach the target cell.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Pattern Check**: The program checks for pairs of characters where both are '<' at specific positions (either directly adjacent or one position apart). This check is too restrictive and does not account for all possible paths the robot can take through the grid.

2. **Missing Path Traversal Logic**: The program does not simulate the actual movement of the robot through the grid based on the arrows. It only checks for certain patterns without considering the sequence of moves the robot would make.

3. **Early Termination**: The program prints 'No' and breaks out of the loop as soon as it finds a pair of '<' characters under the specified conditions. This premature termination means it might miss valid paths that could lead to the target cell (2, n).

Given these issues, the program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the target cell for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
