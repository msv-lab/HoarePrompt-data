Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks pairs of characters from the two strings at specific positions. If it finds a pair where both characters are '<' at certain positions (either directly adjacent or one position apart), it prints 'No' and stops further checks. Otherwise, after completing the checks for all relevant positions, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses based on the input strings for each test case.**
