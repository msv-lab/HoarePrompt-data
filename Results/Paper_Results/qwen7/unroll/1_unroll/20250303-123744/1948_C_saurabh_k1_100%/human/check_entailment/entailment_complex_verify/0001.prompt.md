You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; each test case consists of two strings of length n, where each character in the strings is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        for i in range(1, n, 2):
            if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
                print('No')
                break
        else:
            print('yes')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses printed to the console. For each value of `n`, the program checks pairs of characters from strings `a` and `b`. If it finds a pair where both characters are '<' at specific positions (either directly adjacent or one position apart), it prints 'No' and stops further checks for that `n`. Otherwise, after completing the checks for all relevant positions, it prints 'Yes'. The exact sequence of 'Yes' and 'No' depends on the input values provided for `a` and `b` for each `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks pairs of characters from the two strings at specific positions. If it finds a pair where both characters are '<' at certain positions (either directly adjacent or one position apart), it prints 'No' and stops further checks. Otherwise, after completing the checks for all relevant positions, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not return any value but prints a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses based on the input strings for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if a robot starting at (1, 1) can reach (2, n) by moving according to the arrows in a 2xN grid.
   - The robot moves to the next cell and then follows the arrow in that cell.
   - The robot cannot move outside the grid.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, the first row of arrows (`a`), and the second row of arrows (`b`).
   - It then checks for a specific condition in the loop:
     - If the current column index `i` is odd and the arrow in the first row is `<` and the arrow in the second row at the corresponding positions is also `<`, the robot would get stuck in an infinite loop.
     - Specifically, if `a[i] == '<'` and `b[i+1] == '<'` or `b[i-1] == '<'`, the robot gets stuck.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The code only checks for the condition where the robot might get stuck due to consecutive `<` arrows.
   - However, this logic is incomplete because it does not account for all possible paths the robot can take.
   - The code fails to handle other scenarios where the robot might still reach (2, n) despite not getting stuck.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     4
     6
     >>><<<
     <<><>>
     ```
   - According to the given logic, the robot would get stuck at column 3 because `a[2] == '>'` and `b[3] == '<'`. However, the robot can still reach (2, 6) via the path: (1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (1, 5) -> (2, 5) -> (1, 6) -> (2, 6).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code is incorrect because it incorrectly identifies some valid paths as invalid.
