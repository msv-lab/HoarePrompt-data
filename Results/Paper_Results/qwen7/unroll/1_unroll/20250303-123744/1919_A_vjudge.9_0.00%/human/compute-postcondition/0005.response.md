Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop variable is `result`, which is taken from the `results` list.
   - The loop body itself is omitted, but the loop will continue as long as there are elements in the `results` list.

2. **Determine the Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
   - `results` is a list containing 1000 elements, where each element is the result of calling `func_1(a, b)`.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. Since the list is guaranteed to have 1000 elements, it will always have at least one element.
   - The value of `result` will be the first element of the `results` list when the loop starts its first iteration.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial state of the `results` list and the value of `result` for the first iteration.

**State:**
- `results` is a list containing 1000 elements.
- `result` is the first element of the `results` list.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `results` is a list containing 1000 elements, `result` is the first element of the `results` list**.
