Output State: **The variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive; the `results` list contains the same 1000 elements, which are the results of calling `func_1(a, b)` for each iteration of the loop with `a` and `b` being integers provided by user input. The loop simply prints each element in the `results` list without modifying it.**
