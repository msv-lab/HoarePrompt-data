State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require adjustment since it is initialized within the loop itself.
- The variable `t` is used as the loop control variable, meaning the loop will run `t` times. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (since `range(t)` requires `t` to be non-negative) and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Thus, the state needs to ensure that `t` is an integer and greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.
