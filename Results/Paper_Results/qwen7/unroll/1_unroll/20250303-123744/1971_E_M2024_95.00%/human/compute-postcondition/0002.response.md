Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed for each query within each test case. For each query, the output is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and the specific query value `ql`. The calculation involves finding the segment in arrays `a` and `b` where `ql` falls, adjusting for the difference between `ql` and the previous element in array `a`, and then using linear interpolation to find the corresponding value in array `b`. Each result is printed on a new line for every query within each test case.
