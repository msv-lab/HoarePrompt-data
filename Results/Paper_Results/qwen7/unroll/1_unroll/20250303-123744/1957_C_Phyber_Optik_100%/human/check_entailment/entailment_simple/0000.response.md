Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of rooks on an \(n \times n\) chessboard after \(k\) moves, where each move is mirrored by the computer. The key aspect is to calculate the number of ways to place rooks such that no two rooks attack each other.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming to precompute the number of configurations for smaller board sizes up to 300,000.
   - The `func_1` function populates the `dp` array using the recurrence relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007\).
   - For each test case, the code reads \(n\) and \(k\), and then calculates the number of valid configurations using the precomputed values in the `dp` array adjusted by the number of invalid positions (positions already occupied by rooks).

3. **Dynamic Programming Transition**:
   - The recurrence relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007\) correctly models the number of ways to place rooks on an \(i \times i\) board without attacking each other.
   - This relation ensures that the configurations are counted correctly, considering the constraints of no two rooks in the same row or column.

4. **Handling Test Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating through them and calculating the result for each.
   - The use of a set `invalid` to track already occupied positions is appropriate and efficient.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the number of invalid positions equals \(n\) (all positions are occupied), resulting in exactly one configuration (`max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)])`).

Given the analysis, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
