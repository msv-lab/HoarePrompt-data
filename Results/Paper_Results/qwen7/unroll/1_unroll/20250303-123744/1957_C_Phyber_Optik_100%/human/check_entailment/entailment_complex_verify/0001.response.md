### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires calculating the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent, and no two rooks can attack each other.
   - The `dp` array is used to store the number of configurations for a given number of available positions.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the `dp` array using a recurrence relation.
   - The main logic in the loop calculates the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions after accounting for the invalid positions (where rooks have been placed).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).
   - This relation correctly models the number of ways to place rooks in a row without attacking each other, considering the previously computed values.
   - The main logic correctly calculates the number of invalid positions and uses the `dp` array to determine the number of configurations for the remaining valid positions.

3. **Recurrence Relation Analysis**:
   - The recurrence relation \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \) is correct and efficiently computes the number of valid configurations.
   - The base cases \( dp[1] = 1 \) and \( dp[2] = 3 \) are also correctly initialized.

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the number of invalid positions is calculated by adding the unique rows and columns where rooks have been placed.
   - The final number of configurations is determined by looking up the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the remaining valid positions (`n - len(invalid)`).
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all positions are invalid, the number of configurations is 1 (no rooks can be placed).
   - The code correctly handles the edge case where no valid positions remain.

6. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The code correctly initializes the `dp` array and uses the recurrence relation to compute the necessary values.
   - The main loop correctly handles the input and computes the final configurations.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the annotated code and the original assessment, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately computes the number of possible final configurations for the chessboard after the specified moves.
