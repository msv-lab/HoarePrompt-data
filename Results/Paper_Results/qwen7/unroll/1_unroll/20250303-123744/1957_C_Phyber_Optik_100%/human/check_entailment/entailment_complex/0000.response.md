Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves calculating the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves where rooks are placed without attacking each other. The moves are mirrored by the computer, and the final configurations are counted modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code sets up a dynamic programming (DP) solution to count the number of valid configurations.
   - The function `func_1` precomputes values for the DP table `dp` up to \(300000\).
   - In the main loop, for each test case, it reads the dimensions \(n\) and \(k\), and the positions of the rooks already placed.
   - It uses a set `invalid` to keep track of the rows and columns that are already occupied.
   - Finally, it prints the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]` which represents the number of valid configurations for the remaining empty cells.

3. **DP Table Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly initializes `dp[1]` to 1 and `dp[2]` to 3.
   - The recurrence relation \(dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007\) is used to fill the DP table.
   - This recurrence relation is derived from combinatorial arguments related to placing non-attacking rooks on a board.

4. **Final Configuration Calculation**:
   - The value `dp[n - len(invalid)]` correctly computes the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining cells, considering the already occupied rows and columns.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result fits within the required constraints.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The code handles the constraints appropriately by precomputing the DP table and using it for each test case.
   - The modulo operation ensures that the result is within the required bounds.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
