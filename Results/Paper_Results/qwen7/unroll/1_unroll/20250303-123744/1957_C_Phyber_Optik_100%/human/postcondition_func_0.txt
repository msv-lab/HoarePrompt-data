The function accepts an integer \( n \) and calculates the values of the array \( dp \) from index 1 to \( n \) using the specified formula. Specifically, \( dp[1] \) is set to 1, \( dp[2] \) is set to 3, and for each \( i \) from 3 to \( n \), \( dp[i] \) is computed as \( (dp[i - 1] + 2 \times (i - 1) \times dp[i - 2]) \mod 1000000007 \). The final state of the program includes the computed values of \( dp[i] \) for all \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
