Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `range(3, n + 1)`.
   - `i` is the loop variable.
   - `n` is the upper bound of the range.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - The loop starts with `i` in the range from 3 to `n + 1`.
   - Initially, `i` is set to 3 (the smallest value in the range).

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` starts at 3, we need to ensure that `i` is 3 when the loop begins.
   - The value of `n` must be such that the loop can start, i.e., `n` must be at least 3.

Given the initial conditions:
- `dp[1]` is 1
- `dp[2]` is 3
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)

We don't need to adjust the values of `dp[1]` or `dp[2]` because they are not part of the loop head. The value of `t` is also not relevant to the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 3
- `n` must be at least 3

So, the final state is:
**State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be at least 3**
