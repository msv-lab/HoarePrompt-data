### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### 1. Problem Understanding:
- We need to calculate the number of different final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after \( k \) moves, where each move consists of placing a white rook and a black rook (mirrored).
- The `dp` array is supposed to store the number of configurations for smaller board sizes.
- The formula used in `func_1` is intended to compute the number of configurations for a board of size \( i \).

#### 2. Code Analysis:
- **Dynamic Programming Initialization:**
  ```python
  dp[1] = 1
  dp[2] = 3
  for i in range(3, n + 1):
      dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
  ```
  This part initializes the `dp` array for small board sizes. However, the formula used here is incorrect for the problem. The formula should account for the number of ways to place rooks in a board of size \( i \) considering the constraints of no two rooks attacking each other.

- **Main Logic:**
  ```python
  t = int(input())
  for _ in range(t):
      (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
      invalid = set([])
      for _ in range(k):
          (r, c) = map(int, input().split())
          invalid.add(r)
          invalid.add(c)
      print(max(1, dp[n - len(invalid)]))
  ```
  - The main logic reads the input and computes the number of valid configurations for a board of size \( n \) after removing the invalid positions (rows and columns occupied by rooks).
  - The `invalid` set stores the rows and columns occupied by rooks.
  - The final print statement outputs the number of configurations for a board of size \( n - \text{len(invalid)} \).

#### 3. Correctness Evaluation:
- **Dynamic Programming Formula:**
  The formula used in `func_1` is incorrect. The correct formula for the number of ways to place rooks in a board of size \( i \) without attacking each other is more complex and involves combinatorial methods.
  
- **Invalid Positions Handling:**
  The program correctly identifies and removes invalid positions from the board. However, the `dp` array is not used effectively to compute the number of configurations for the remaining board.

- **Combinatorial Calculation:**
  To correctly solve the problem, we need to use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of ways to place rooks in the remaining rows and columns. This involves calculating the number of permutations of rows and columns, considering the constraints.

#### 4. Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to calculate the number of different final configurations. The `dp` array is not used correctly, and the formula used in `func_1` is incorrect. The program fails to account for the specific constraints and requirements of the problem.

### Final:
Final: **False**
