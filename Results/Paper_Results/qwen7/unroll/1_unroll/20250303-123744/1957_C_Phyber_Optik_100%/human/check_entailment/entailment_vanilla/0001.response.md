### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of a chessboard after a series of moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent, and no two rooks can attack each other.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The `dp` array is used to store the number of configurations for a given number of available positions.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the `dp` array using a recurrence relation.
   - The main logic in the loop calculates the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions after accounting for the invalid positions (where rooks have been placed).

3. **Recurrence Relation Analysis**:
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).
   - This relation correctly models the number of ways to place rooks in a row without attacking each other, considering the previously computed values.

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the number of invalid positions is calculated by adding the unique rows and columns where rooks have been placed.
   - The final number of configurations is determined by looking up the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the remaining valid positions (`n - len(invalid)`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all positions are invalid, the number of configurations is 1 (no rooks can be placed).
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits.

6. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The code correctly initializes the `dp` array and uses the recurrence relation to compute the necessary values.
   - The main loop correctly handles the input and computes the final configurations.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the solution to the problem. It accurately computes the number of possible final configurations for the chessboard after the specified moves.

### Correctness:
**True**
