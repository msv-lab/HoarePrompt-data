### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves determining the number of possible final configurations of an \( n \times n \) chessboard after a series of moves, where each move is mirrored by the opponent, and no two rooks can attack each other.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The `dp` array is used to store the number of configurations for a given number of available positions.
   - The function `func_1` initializes the `dp` array using a recurrence relation.
   - The main logic in the loop calculates the number of valid configurations for the remaining positions after accounting for the invalid positions (where rooks have been placed).

3. **Recurrence Relation Analysis**:
   - The recurrence relation used in `func_1` is \( dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + 2 \times (i-1) \times dp[i-2]) \mod 1000000007 \).
   - This relation correctly models the number of ways to place rooks in a row without attacking each other, considering the previously computed values.

4. **Main Logic Analysis**:
   - For each test case, the number of invalid positions is calculated by adding the unique rows and columns where rooks have been placed.
   - The final number of configurations is determined by looking up the value in the `dp` array corresponding to the remaining valid positions (`n - len(invalid)`).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all positions are invalid, the number of configurations is 1 (no rooks can be placed).
   - The use of modulo \(10^9 + 7\) ensures that the result fits within standard integer limits.

6. **Implementation Verification**:
   - The code correctly initializes the `dp` array and uses the recurrence relation to compute the necessary values.
   - The main loop correctly handles the input and computes the final configurations.

However, there is a critical issue with the implementation. The function `func_1` is called with an argument of 300000, which is hardcoded. This means that the `dp` array is precomputed for up to 300000 positions, but the problem guarantees that the sum of \( n \) over all test cases does not exceed \( 3 \cdot 10^5 \). This means that the `dp` array might not be fully initialized for some test cases where \( n > 300000 \).

To fix this, the function `func_1` should be called with the actual value of \( n \) for each test case. Additionally, the `dp` array should be dynamically resized to accommodate the maximum possible \( n \) for the test cases.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it precomputes the `dp` array for a fixed size of 300000, which may not cover the maximum possible \( n \) for the test cases. The `dp` array should be dynamically resized based on the input \( n \) for each test case.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
