### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of cells to color in an \( n \times n \) grid such that at least \( k \) diagonals have at least one colored cell.
   - A grid of size \( n \times n \) has \( 4n - 2 \) diagonals in total.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution uses the formula `k // 2 + 1` when `4 * n - 2 == k`.
   - For other cases, it uses `ceil(k / 2)`.

3. **Case Analysis:**
   - **Case 1:** When \( 4n - 2 = k \):
     - This means we need exactly \( k \) diagonals to have at least one colored cell.
     - Since each row and column contributes to multiple diagonals, coloring the center cell (if \( n \) is odd) or two cells (if \( n \) is even) can achieve this.
     - The formula `k // 2 + 1` correctly calculates the minimum number of cells needed because:
       - If \( k = 4n - 2 \), then \( k // 2 + 1 = (4n - 2) // 2 + 1 = 2n - 1 \).
       - This ensures that all diagonals are covered, as each diagonal will intersect at least one of these cells.
   - **Case 2:** When \( 4n - 2 > k \):
     - Here, we need to cover fewer than all diagonals.
     - The formula `ceil(k / 2)` ensures that we cover at least \( k \) diagonals with the minimum number of cells.
     - This is because each cell can cover up to 2 diagonals (one main diagonal and one anti-diagonal).

4. **Verification:**
   - The solution handles both edge cases and general cases correctly.
   - The logic aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the provided examples.
