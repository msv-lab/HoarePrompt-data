Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `4 * n - 2`. According to the problem description, `k` can be up to `4 * n - 2`, but the program attempts to calculate the result using `k / 2` directly without checking this condition. This leads to incorrect results for certain values of `k`.

For example, consider the following input:
- Input: `2 3`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Program Output: `2`

This case works correctly. However, consider another case:
- Input: `2 4`
- Expected Output: `2` (since all diagonals must have at least one colored cell)
- Program Output: `2` (which is incorrect because it should be `2` but the logic does not handle this boundary condition properly)

To fix this, the program should include a check to ensure `k` does not exceed `4 * n - 2` before performing the calculation.
