Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array `b` such that:
     - The sums of elements in both arrays are equal.
     - All elements in `b` are different from the corresponding elements in `a`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

2. **Program Logic Analysis**:
   - The program calculates the prefix sums (`p`) and the count of 1s up to each position (`c`).
   - For each query, it checks if the number of 1s in the subarray (from `a` to `b`) is at least half the length of the subarray. This is not sufficient to determine if the subarray is "good" according to the problem description.

3. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To determine if a subarray is "good", we need to check if it's possible to construct an array `b` that meets the conditions. One way to do this is to ensure that the subarray has enough elements to allow for rearrangement while maintaining the sum and ensuring no elements are the same.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
