Reasoning:
1. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to check if a subarray is "good" according to the problem statement.
2. The solution incorrectly counts the number of `1`s in the subarray and checks if it meets a certain condition, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.
3. The problem requires checking if there exists an array `b` such that:
   - The sums of elements in `a` and `b` are equal.
   - No element in `a` equals the corresponding element in `b`.
   - All elements in `b` are positive.
4. The current implementation does not consider these conditions. Instead, it seems to be checking if the number of `1`s in the subarray is at least half the length of the subarray, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.
5. To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
   - Calculate the sum of the subarray.
   - Check if the subarray can be transformed into another array with the same sum but different elements.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
