Output State: The list `list` will be transformed such that for every element at index `i` (where `1 < i < n-1`), if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, then `list[i]` will be reduced by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i-1]` will be reduced by itself, and `list[i+1]` will be reduced by the value of `list[i-1]`. This process continues until the condition in the while loop is no longer satisfied for any `i`. All other elements in the list will remain unchanged.
