Based on the initial state provided, the precondition describes how the elements of the list `list` will be modified according to certain conditions. However, the specific values of the list elements are not explicitly given. The only thing we know for sure is that after all possible reductions, the function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.

Given this information, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply output the string 'YES'.

Output: **YES**
