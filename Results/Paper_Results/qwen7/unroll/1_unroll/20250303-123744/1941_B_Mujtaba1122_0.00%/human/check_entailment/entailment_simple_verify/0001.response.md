### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations involve choosing an index `i` (2 ≤ i ≤ n-1) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - Each operation reduces the sum of the array by exactly 3.
   - To make all elements zero, the total sum of the array must be divisible by 3.

3. **Implementation Analysis:**
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to perform the operations to reduce the array elements to zero.
     - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2.
     - For each element `a[i]` greater than 1, it ensures that `a[i-1]` is also greater than 0 and `a[i+1]` is greater than 0 before performing the operation.
     - The operation reduces `a[i-1]` by `a[i-1]`, `a[i]` by `2 * a[i-1]`, and `a[i+1]` by `a[i-1]`.

4. **Correctness of `func_2`:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly applies the operations to reduce the array elements.
   - The function prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on whether `func_1` returns `True` after the operations.

5. **Main Function:**
   - The main function reads the input, calls `func_2` for each test case, and prints the result.
   - This approach is correct because it follows the problem requirements and prints the appropriate output for each test case.

6. **Correctness of the Provided Program:**
   - The program correctly implements the logic to check if it is possible to make all elements zero.
   - It uses `func_2` to attempt the operations and then checks with `func_1` to determine the final result.
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, which is the expected output format.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The program prints the correct output for each test case, which meets the problem requirements.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
