Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` if any element is non-zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function performs the operations to potentially make all elements zero.
   - It iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2.
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the specified operations:
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` (which simplifies to `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]` and thus sets `list[i-1]` to 0).
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]` (since `list[i-1]` is now 0, this effectively sets `list[i]` to 0).
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]` (again, since `list[i-1]` is 0, this effectively sets `list[i+1]` to 0).
   - After performing these operations, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Validity**:
   - The operations performed in `func_2` are valid according to the problem statement.
   - Each operation reduces three elements in the array by specific amounts, which is allowed.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where some elements might already be zero before starting the operations.
   - The operations ensure that if an element becomes zero, it remains zero during subsequent operations.

3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The program terminates after checking all indices and performing the necessary operations.
   - If all elements become zero, it correctly prints 'YES'.
   - If any element remains non-zero, it correctly prints 'NO'.

4. **Overall Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that if the operations can make all elements zero, they will be made zero.
   - The use of `func_1` to check the final state is appropriate and ensures correctness.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the given program correctly implements the logic to determine if all elements in the array can be made zero using the specified operations.

**Correctness: True**
