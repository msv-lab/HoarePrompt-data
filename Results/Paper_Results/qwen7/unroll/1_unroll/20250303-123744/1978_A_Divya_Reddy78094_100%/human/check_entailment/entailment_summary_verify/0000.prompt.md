You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice has n books. The 1 -st book contains a_1 pages, the 2 -nd book contains
a_2 pages, \ldots , the n -th book contains a_n pages. Alice does the
following:

  * She divides all the books into two non-empty piles. Thus, each book ends up in exactly one of the two piles.
  * Alice reads one book with the highest number in each pile.

Alice loves reading very much. Help her find the maximum total number of pages
she can read by dividing the books into two piles.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 100
) — the number of books Alice has.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the number of pages in each book.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum number of pages
Alice can read.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    4
    
    2 3 3 1
    
    5
    
    2 2 3 2 2
    
    2
    
    10 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    2
    4
    5
    13
    5
    
Note

In the first test case, Alice can put book number 1 in the first pile, and
book number 2 in the second pile. Then she will read a_1 + a_2 = 1 + 1 = 2
pages.

In the second test case, Alice can put books with numbers 2 and 3 in the first
pile, and books with numbers 1 and 4 in the second pile. Then she will read
the book with the highest number 3 from the first pile, and the book with the
highest number 4 from the second pile. Then she will read a_3 + a_4 = 3 + 1 =
4 pages.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(max(nums[:-1]) + nums[-1])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer t indicating the number of test cases, an integer n indicating the number of books, and a list of n integers representing the number of pages in each book. It then prints the sum of the maximum page number of all but the last book and the page number of the last book for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program always includes the last element in the second pile, which may not maximize the total number of pages Alice can read. For example, consider the input:

```
3
2 3 1
```

According to the problem description, we need to divide the books into two non-empty piles such that the sum of the maximum page numbers in both piles is maximized. However, the current implementation always pairs the largest number with the second-largest number, which might not be optimal. 

A correct approach would involve finding the two largest numbers and ensuring they are placed in different piles. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
        max1 = max(nums)
        nums.remove(max1)
        max2 = max(nums)
        print(max1 + max2)
```

This corrected version ensures that the two largest numbers are placed in different piles, thus maximizing the total number of pages Alice can read.
