Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; `n` is an unknown integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive); a list of `n` integers representing the number of pages in each book has not yet been defined.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, updating the value of `t`. The value of `n` and the list of integers representing the number of pages in each book have not been defined yet, so they remain as part of the precondition.
