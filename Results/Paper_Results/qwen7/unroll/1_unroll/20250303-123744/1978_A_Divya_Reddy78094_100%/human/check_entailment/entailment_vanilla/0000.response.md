### Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the highest page numbers from two non-empty piles of books.
2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of page numbers `nums`.
   - It then prints the sum of the maximum value from the first `n-1` elements and the last element of `nums`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If we consider the example where `nums = [1, 1]`, the solution prints `max([1]) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2`. This is correct because the maximum total pages read is indeed 2.
   - For the example `nums = [2, 3, 3, 1]`, the solution prints `max([2, 3, 3]) + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4`. This is also correct as the maximum total pages read is 4.
   - However, the solution does not ensure that the division of books into two piles results in both piles being non-empty. The last element is always included in one of the piles, but the rest of the books might not be optimally divided.

4. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To maximize the total number of pages read, we should ideally place the largest page number in one pile and the next largest in the other pile.
   - The current implementation does not guarantee this optimal division.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While the provided solution works for some edge cases, it does not guarantee the optimal solution for all cases. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the division of books results in both piles being non-empty and optimally chosen.
