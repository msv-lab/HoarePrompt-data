Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size \(n \times m\) where \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers between 1 and 500, and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function determines whether it is possible to traverse from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid such that every step moves only to adjacent cells and maintains the same color. If such a traversal is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.**
