Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it checks only two conditions to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, but it fails to consider other configurations that could still allow all squares to be the same color.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```

In this case, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because the top-left and bottom-right corners are different colors (`B` and `W`), and the horizontal and vertical checks also fail. However, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:

1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 1) to make all squares in the first column black.
2. Select positions (1, 3) and (3, 3) to make all squares in the third column black.

After these operations, all squares in the grid will be black. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it incorrect.
