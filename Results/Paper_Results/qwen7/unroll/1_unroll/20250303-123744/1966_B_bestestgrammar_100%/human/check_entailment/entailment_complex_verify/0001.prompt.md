You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

    #State: Output State: t is an input integer; for each tc in range(t), n and m are integers read from input, gr is a list of n strings read from input, ans is initially set to 'YES', and after processing the grid, ans is printed as either 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size \(n \times m\) where \(n\) and \(m\) are positive integers between 1 and 500, and each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function determines whether it is possible to traverse from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid such that every step moves only to adjacent cells and maintains the same color. If such a traversal is possible, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all squares in an \( n \times m \) grid the same color using the given operations. An operation allows selecting two squares of the same color and changing the color of all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the top-left corner square and the bottom-right corner square have different colors, it's impossible to make all squares the same color because any operation would only affect a subrectangle that includes both corners.
   - If the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color, we need to check if there are any other conflicting colors in the grid.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \), and the grid itself.
   - It initializes `ans` to `'YES'`.
   - It checks if the top-left and bottom-right corners have the same color. If they don't, it sets `ans` to `'NO'` and exits.
   - If the corners have the same color, it further checks if there are any other conflicting colors in the grid by examining the first row and the last column. If any of these checks fail, it sets `ans` to `'NO'`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic correctly identifies the impossible scenario where the top-left and bottom-right corners have different colors.
   - The additional checks for the first row and last column ensure that no conflicting colors exist, which is necessary for making all squares the same color.
   - The implementation handles all given constraints and examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Therefore, the program is correct.
