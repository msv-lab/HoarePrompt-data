Output State: **`l` is the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12.**

Explanation: The code calls the function `func_1(n, k)` and assigns its return value to the variable `l`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states. The exact value of `l` depends on the implementation of `func_1`, but it is guaranteed to be the return value of that function.
