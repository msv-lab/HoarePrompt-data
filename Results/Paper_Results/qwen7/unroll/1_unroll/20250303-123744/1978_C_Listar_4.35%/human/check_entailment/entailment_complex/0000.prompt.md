Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let's call the Manhattan value of a permutation^{\dagger} p the value of the
expression |p_1 - 1| + |p_2 - 2| + \ldots + |p_n - n| .

For example, for the permutation [1, 2, 3] , the Manhattan value is |1 - 1| +
|2 - 2| + |3 - 3| = 0 , and for the permutation [3, 1, 2] , the Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

You are given integers n and k . Find a permutation p of length n such that
its Manhattan value is equal to k , or determine that no such permutation
exists.

^{\dagger} A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct
integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a
permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array),
and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^{4} ) — the number of test cases. The description
of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^{5}, 0 \le k \le 10^{12} ) — the length of the permutation and the
required Manhattan value.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^{5} .

Output

For each test case, if there is no suitable permutation, output "No".
Otherwise, in the first line, output "Yes", and in the second line, output n
distinct integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — a suitable
permutation.

If there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    8
    
    3 4
    
    4 5
    
    7 0
    
    1 1000000000000
    
    8 14
    
    112 777
    
    5 12
    
    5 2

Output

    Yes
    3 1 2
    No
    Yes
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7
    No
    Yes
    8 2 3 4 5 6 1 7
    No
    Yes
    5 4 3 1 2
    Yes
    2 1 3 4 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the permutation [3, 1, 2] is suitable, its Manhattan
value is |3 - 1| + |1 - 2| + |2 - 3| = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 .

In the second test case, it can be proven that there is no permutation of
length 4 with a Manhattan value of 5 .

In the third test case, the permutation [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is suitable, its
Manhattan value is |1-1|+|2-2|+|3-3|+|4-4|+|5-5|+|6-6|+|7-7|=0 .

    #State: Output State: `l` is a list where the elements are rotated to the left by `k` positions. If `k` is greater than the length of the list, the rotation wraps around. The list initially contains integers from 1 to `n` inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `n` (an integer between 1 and 200,000) and `k` (an integer between 0 and 1,000,000,000,000), and returns a list of integers from 1 to `n` inclusive, rotated to the left by `k` positions. If `k` is greater than `n`, the rotation wraps around.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^{5} and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}.
def func_2():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (k % 2) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two zeros (0, 0)
    #State: `n` is an integer obtained from the first number input, `k` is an integer obtained from the second number input, and `k` is even
    if (n % 2) :
        max_k = (n ** 2 - 1) // 2
    else :
        max_k = n ** 2 // 2
    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer. If `n` is odd, `max_k` is set to `n`. If `n` is even, `max_k` is also set to `n`.
    if (max_k < k) :

    #State: Postcondition: `n` is an integer, `k` is an even integer. `max_k` is set to `n`.
    return n, k
    #The program returns n and k, where n is an integer and k is an even integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the user. It then checks if \( k \) is even and if \( n \) is odd or even, setting a maximum value for \( k \) based on \( n \). If \( k \) exceeds this maximum value, it returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \). The function can return either (0, 0) or (n, k), where \( n \) is an integer and \( k \) is an even integer.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l is a list of integers representing a valid permutation of length n such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to k.
def func_3(l):
    print('YES')
    #This is printed: YES
    for i in l:
        print(i, end=' ')
        
    #State: The elements of the list l printed in the same order, separated by spaces.
    print()
    #This is printed: ''
    return
    #The program returns nothing
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `l` of integers representing a valid permutation of length `n` such that the Manhattan value of the permutation is equal to `k`. It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces. After printing, the function returns nothing.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: (n, k) are integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= k <= 10^12.
def func_4():
    n, k = func_2()
    if (n == 0) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
        return
        #The program returns None
    #State: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 10^12. `n` is not equal to 0
    l = func_1(n, k)
    func_3(l)
    return
    #The program returns the result of calling function `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and returns either `None` or the result of calling `func_3(l)`, where `l` is the result of the function call `func_1(n, k)`. If `n` is 0, the function prints 'NO' and returns `None`. Otherwise, it proceeds to call `func_1(n, k)` with the given constraints on `n` and `k`, then calls `func_3(l)` with the result of `func_1(n, k)`, and returns the result of this call.
