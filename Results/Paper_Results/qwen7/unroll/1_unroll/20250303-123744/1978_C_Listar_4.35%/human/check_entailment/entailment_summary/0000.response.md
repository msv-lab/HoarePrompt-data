### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) from the input.
   - It checks if \( k \) is even and if \( n \) is odd or even.
   - It calculates the maximum possible Manhattan value for a permutation of length \( n \) and ensures \( k \) does not exceed this maximum value.
   - If \( k \) is odd or exceeds the maximum possible value, it returns (0, 0).
   - Otherwise, it returns \( n \) and \( k \).

2. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function takes \( n \) and \( k \) as inputs.
   - It initializes a list `l` with integers from 1 to \( n \).
   - It performs rotations on the list `l` to achieve a specific Manhattan value.
   - The rotations are designed to ensure that the resulting permutation has the desired Manhattan value.

3. **Function `func_3(l)`**:
   - This function takes a list `l` as input.
   - It prints "YES" followed by the elements of the list `l` separated by spaces.
   - It returns nothing.

4. **Function `func_4()`**:
   - This function calls `func_2()` to get \( n \) and \( k \).
   - If \( n \) is 0, it prints 'NO' and returns.
   - Otherwise, it calls `func_1(n, k)` to generate the permutation and then calls `func_3(l)` to print the result.

### Analysis:
- The overall logic of the program is to first validate the inputs using `func_2()`.
- If the inputs are valid, it generates a permutation using `func_1()` and prints the result using `func_3()`.
- If the inputs are invalid, it correctly prints 'NO'.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the program correctly handles the inputs, validates them, and generates the appropriate output based on the constraints provided.

### Conclusion:
The program is designed to meet the problem requirements accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
