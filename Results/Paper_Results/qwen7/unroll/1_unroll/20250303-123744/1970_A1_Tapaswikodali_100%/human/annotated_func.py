#State of the program right berfore the function call: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence.
def func_1(infoA, infoB):
    if (infoA.balance != infoB.balance) :
        return infoA.balance - infoB.balance
        #The program returns the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance, where both infoA and infoB are objects with an attribute balance that is an integer.
    #State: infoA and infoB are objects that have attributes `balance` and `position`, where `balance` is an integer and `position` is an integer representing the position of a character in a balanced parentheses sequence. The balance of `infoA` is equal to the balance of `infoB`.
    return infoB.position - infoA.position
    #The program returns the difference between the position attribute of infoB and the position attribute of infoA, where both infoA and infoB have equal balance attributes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects containing attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). Depending on the values of these attributes, the function returns either the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance, or the difference between infoB's position and infoA's position. If the balances are different, it returns the balance difference; if the balances are equal, it returns the position difference.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string s is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_2(s):
    n = len(s)
    balance_info = []
    balance = 0
    for i in range(n):
        balance_info.append(BalanceInfo(balance, i, s[i]))
        
        if s[i] == '(':
            balance += 1
        else:
            balance -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is a list of `BalanceInfo` objects where each object contains the balance, index, and character from `s` at that index; `balance` is 0.
    balance_info.sort(key=lambda x: (x.balance, -x.position))
    result = ''.join(info.character for info in balance_info)
    print(result)
    #This is printed: result (a string composed of characters from `s` based on the sorting rules of `balance_info`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")", calculates the balance of parentheses at each position, sorts the characters in `s` based on their balance and position, and prints a new string composed of these characters. The final state of the program includes the original string `s`, its length `n`, a sorted list of `BalanceInfo` objects, and a printed string `result` composed of characters from `s` based on the sorting rules.
