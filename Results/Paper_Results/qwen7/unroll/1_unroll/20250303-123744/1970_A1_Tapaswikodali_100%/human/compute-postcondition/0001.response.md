Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `balance_info`. This does not affect the values of `s` or `n`. Therefore, the length of `s` remains `n`, and `s` remains a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The new information is that `balance_info` is now an empty list.
