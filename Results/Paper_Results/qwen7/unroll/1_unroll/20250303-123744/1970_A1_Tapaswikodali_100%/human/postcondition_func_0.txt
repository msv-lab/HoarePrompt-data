The function accepts two parameters, infoA and infoB, which are objects containing attributes `balance` (an integer) and `position` (an integer). Depending on the values of these attributes, the function returns either the difference between infoA's balance and infoB's balance, or the difference between infoB's position and infoA's position. If the balances are different, it returns the balance difference; if the balances are equal, it returns the position difference.
