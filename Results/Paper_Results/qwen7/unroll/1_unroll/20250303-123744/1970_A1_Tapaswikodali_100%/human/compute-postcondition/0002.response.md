Output State: **`s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `balance_info` is an empty list; `balance` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `balance` to 0. This does not affect the values of `s`, `n`, or `balance_info`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `balance` is updated to 0.
