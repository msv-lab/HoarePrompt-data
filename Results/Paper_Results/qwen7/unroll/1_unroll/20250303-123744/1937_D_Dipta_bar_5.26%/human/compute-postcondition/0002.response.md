Output State: **`s` is a string of length `n`; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `A` is an empty list; `idx_A` is an empty list.**

The code `idx_A = []` creates a new empty list and assigns it to the variable `idx_A`. The initial values of `s`, `n`, and `A` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still a string of length `n`, `n` is still the length of the string `s`, `A` is still an empty list, and `idx_A` is now an empty list.
