### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball's movement depends on the direction (`<` or `>`) at each cell, and the direction changes after each move.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the grid `n` and the string `s` representing the directions.
   - The function `func_1(s)` is defined to process the string `s`.

3. **Function `func_1(s)`**:
   - It calculates two arrays `A` and `B` which store the cumulative distances traveled by the pinball when it moves right and left respectively.
   - `A` array is built by iterating from left to right, and `B` array is built by iterating from right to left.
   - The logic for building these arrays seems to be correct as it accounts for the changing directions and the cumulative distances.
   - The main loop in `func_1(s)` then uses these arrays to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid from each starting cell.

4. **Main Loop Logic**:
   - The main loop iterates through each cell and uses the precomputed arrays `A` and `B` to determine the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid.
   - The logic for computing the time taken seems to correctly handle the changing directions and the cumulative distances.
   - However, upon closer inspection, there are several issues with the main loop logic:
     - The calculation of `x` in the `if l < r` block is incorrect. The formula `x = r - (l + 2)` does not accurately represent the number of intermediate cells that need to be subtracted.
     - The handling of the boundary conditions and the cumulative sums is complex and error-prone. The code attempts to adjust the cumulative sums based on the positions of `>` and `<` characters, but the logic is overly complicated and prone to errors.
     - The use of `l` and `r` indices in the main loop is not straightforward and may lead to off-by-one errors or incorrect results.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles edge cases where the pinball starts at the boundaries of the grid.
   - However, the overall logic for handling the cumulative distances and the changing directions is flawed, leading to potential incorrect results.

6. **Output**:
   - The output is printed correctly for each test case and for each starting cell, but the underlying logic for calculating the time taken is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic for calculating the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid is fundamentally flawed. The main loop logic and the way cumulative distances are handled are incorrect, leading to potentially wrong results.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
