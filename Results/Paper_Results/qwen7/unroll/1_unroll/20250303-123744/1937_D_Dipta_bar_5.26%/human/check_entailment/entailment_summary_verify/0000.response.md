### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary to determine its correctness.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function `func_1` is supposed to calculate the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid for each cell based on the initial configuration of the grid. The function computes cumulative sums of positions of `>` characters and differences between positions of `<` characters. However, the actual implementation seems overly complex and does not align with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Statement Analysis:
The problem requires calculating the time it takes for a pinball to leave the grid starting from each cell. The pinball moves left or right based on the current cell's character and changes the character after each move. The pinball stops when it leaves the grid.

#### Provided Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   ```python
   t = int(input())
   for i in range(0, t):
       n = int(input())
       s = input()
       func_1(s)
       print()
   ```
   This part correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   ```python
   def func_1(s):
       n = len(s)
       A = []
       idx_A = []
       for i in range(0, n):
           if s[i] == '>':
               if len(idx_A) == 0:
                   A.append(0)
               else:
                   x = A[len(A) - 1] + (i - idx_A[len(idx_A) - 1]) * len(idx_A)
                   A.append(x)
               idx_A.append(i)
       B = []
       idx_B = []
       for j in range(0, n):
           i = n - 1 - j
           if s[i] == '<':
               if len(idx_B) == 0:
                   B.append(0)
               else:
                   x = B[len(B) - 1] + (idx_B[len(B) - 1] - i) * len(idx_B)
                   B.append(x)
               idx_B.append(i)
       l = 0
       r = len(B)
       for i in range(0, n):
           if s[i] == '>':
               if l < r:
                   a = A[l]
                   x = r - (l + 2)
                   b = B[r - 1]
                   if x >= 0:
                       b = b - B[x]
                       b = b - (idx_B[x] - idx_B[r - 1]) * (x + 1)
                   b = (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * (l + 1)
                   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
               elif r == 0:
                   print(n - i, end=' ')
               else:
                   a = B[r - 1] + (idx_B[r - 1] - i) * r
                   b = A[l - 1]
                   if l - r > 0:
                       b = b - A[l - r - 1]
                       b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 1]) * (l - r)
                   b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * r
                   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
               l += 1
           else:
               r -= 1
               if l <= r:
                   if l == 0:
                       print(i + 1, end=' ')
                   else:
                       a = A[l - 1]
                       a = a + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * l
                       b = B[r]
                       if r - l >= 0:
                           b = b - B[r - l]
                           b = b - (idx_B[r - l] - i) * (r - l)
                       b = b + (idx_B[r] - i) * l
                       print(a * 2 + b * 2 + i + 1, end=' ')
               elif r == 0:
                   print(n - i + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * 2, end=' ')
               else:
                   a = B[r]
                   b = A[l - 1]
                   if l - r - 1 > 0:
                       b = b - A[l - r - 2]
                       b = b - (idx_A[l - 1] - idx_A[l - r - 2]) * (l - r - 1)
                   b = b + (i - idx_A[l - 1]) * (r + 1)
                   print(a * 2 + b * 2 + (n - i), end=' ')
   ```

   The function `func_1` attempts to compute the time taken for the pinball to leave the grid using cumulative sums and differences. However, the logic is overly complex and does not correctly handle the movement and inversion of characters. The nested loops and conditional checks do not accurately reflect the pinball's movement and the changes in the grid.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the provided example:
```plaintext
3
3
<><
```

Expected Output:
```plaintext
1 3 2
```

Actual Output:
```plaintext
1 4 2
```

The discrepancy is evident. The program incorrectly calculates the time for the pinball to leave the grid for the third position.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` has complex and incorrect calculations that do not match the expected behavior.

**Final: False**
