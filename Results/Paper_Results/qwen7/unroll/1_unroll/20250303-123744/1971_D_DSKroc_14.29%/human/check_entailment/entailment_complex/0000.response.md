Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of positions where a digit is greater than the next digit in the binary string and then adding one to this count. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of cuts required to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Here's why the provided solution is incorrect:
1. The logic `if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):` checks if the current digit is greater than the next digit, which is not relevant to the problem. Instead, we need to find the points where the sequence of zeros and ones changes from increasing to decreasing.
2. The correct approach would be to count the number of transitions from '0' to '1' in the string. Each transition indicates a point where a cut could be made to separate a block of '0's from a block of '1's.
3. If there are no transitions (i.e., the string is already sorted), then no cuts are needed, and the answer is 1.
4. If there are transitions, the number of cuts needed is equal to the number of transitions.

Given these points, the provided solution will not yield the correct results for most cases. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
