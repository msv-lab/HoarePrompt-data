Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input does not affect its value. Therefore, `t` retains its initial condition of being an integer between 1 and 10^4, while `n_cases` is set to the integer input provided by the user.
