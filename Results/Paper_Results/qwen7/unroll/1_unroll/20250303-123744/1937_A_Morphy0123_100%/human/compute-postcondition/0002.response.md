Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each `i` from `0` to `n_cases-1`, the program processes an input `n` and prints either `1`, `2 ** power`, where `power` is the smallest integer such that `2 ** power` is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n`, depending on the value of `n`.
