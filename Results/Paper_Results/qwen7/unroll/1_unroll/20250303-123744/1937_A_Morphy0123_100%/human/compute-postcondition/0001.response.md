State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0** 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the variables involved in the loop head: The loop head involves `i` and `n_cases`.
2. Determine the initial value of `i`: The loop starts with `i` initialized to 0.
3. Determine the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute as long as `i < n_cases`.
4. Ensure `n_cases` is valid: Since `i` starts at 0, for the loop to execute at least once, `n_cases` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
