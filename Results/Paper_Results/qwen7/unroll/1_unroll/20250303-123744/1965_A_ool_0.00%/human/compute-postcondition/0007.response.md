Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(set_)):`.
   - The variables involved in this loop head are `i` and `set_`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables:**
   - From the given state before the loop starts: `A` is False; `arr[0]` is 1; `set_` is [1]; `not_c` is True.
   - We need to focus on adjusting the initial state of `i` and `set_`.

3. **Understand the Condition for the Loop to Execute:**
   - The loop `for i in range(1, len(set_)):` will execute if `len(set_)` is greater than 1.
   - This means that `set_` must have more than one element for the loop to start.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - Since `set_` is initially [1], it has exactly one element. Therefore, the loop will not execute as written because `len(set_)` is 1, and the range starts from 1.
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `set_` must have more than one element.

5. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - Adjust `set_` to have at least two elements (e.g., `[1, 2]`).
   - The variable `i` will be initialized to 1 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`A` is False, `arr[0]` is 1, `set_` must have at least 2 elements, `not_c` is True, `i` is 1**
