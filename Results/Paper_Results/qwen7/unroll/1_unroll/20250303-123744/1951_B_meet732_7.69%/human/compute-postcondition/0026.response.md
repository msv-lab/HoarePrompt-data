Postcondition: `ind` is a list containing indices of exactly one element from list `a` where the element is greater than `x`, `a` remains a list of \( n \) distinct integers representing the Cowdeforces ratings of \( n \) cows, `k` is 14, `x` is the 14th element of list `a`, `c` is 0 (since exactly one element greater than `x` is found), and `ind` is not an empty list, and `ind[0]` is less than or equal to 14.
