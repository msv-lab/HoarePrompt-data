Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `a` as input.
   - It identifies indices of at most two elements in `a` that are greater than the `k`-th element of `a`.
   - Based on certain conditions, it returns a specific value.

2. **Conditions in `func_1`**:
   - If no elements are greater than `a[k]`, it returns `n - 1`.
   - If there is exactly one element greater than `a[k]` and its index is 0, it returns `k - 1`.
   - If the index of the first greater element is greater than `k`, it returns the index of this greater element minus 1.
   - If the index of the first greater element is less than or equal to `k`, it returns the maximum of the differences between `k` and the first greater element's index, or between the first greater element's index and 1.
   - If there are two greater elements, it returns the minimum value between the second greater element's index minus 1 and 13, or the maximum difference between the first and second greater element's indices, or the maximum difference between the first greater element's index and `k`.

3. **Comparison with Expected Behavior**:
   - The execution summary correctly describes how the function behaves under various conditions.
   - The logic in the function matches the expected behavior as described in the problem statement and examples.
   - The function handles all edge cases and conditions mentioned in the problem statement.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as per the given problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
