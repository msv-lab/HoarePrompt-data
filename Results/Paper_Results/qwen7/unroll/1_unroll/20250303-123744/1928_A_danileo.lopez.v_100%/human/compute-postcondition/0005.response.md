Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). For each pair, it checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If so, it further checks if half of the even number matches the other number. If the condition is met, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. If both numbers are odd, it always prints 'No'. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the printed outputs.**
