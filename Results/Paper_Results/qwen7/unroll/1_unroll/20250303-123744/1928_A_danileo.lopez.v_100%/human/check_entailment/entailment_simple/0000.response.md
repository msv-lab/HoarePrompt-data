Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If either dimension is even, it divides the rectangle into two equal smaller rectangles and checks if the dimensions of these smaller rectangles can form a new rectangle that is different from the original.
3. **Conditions for 'Yes'**:
   - If `a` is even, it divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `a//2` by `a//2`. If `a//2` is not equal to `b`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - If `b` is even, it divides the rectangle into two smaller rectangles of size `b//2` by `b//2`. If `b//2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'Yes'.
4. **Conditions for 'No'**: If neither `a` nor `b` is even, or if the conditions for 'Yes' are not met, it prints 'No'.
5. **Output Consistency**: The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case based on the conditions provided, which matches the expected behavior.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` is consistent with the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
