Output State: **The program returns the list 'ans' which contains the cumulative product of the list 'arr' from the end to the start**

This means that the program returns a list where each element is the product of all the elements from that position to the last element of the original list 'arr'. For example, if `arr = [2, 3, 4, 5]`, then `ans` would be `[120, 60, 20, 5]` because:
- The last element (5) remains as it is.
- The second last element (4) is multiplied by 5, resulting in 20.
- The third last element (3) is multiplied by 20, resulting in 60.
- The first element (2) is multiplied by 60, resulting in 120.
