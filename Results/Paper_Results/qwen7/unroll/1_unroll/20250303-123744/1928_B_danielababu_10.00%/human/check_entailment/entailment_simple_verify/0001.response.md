### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of elements equal to the same number in the array `a` after adding a permutation to the array. This means we need to find a permutation such that the frequency of the most common number in the modified array is maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that by choosing a suitable permutation, we can make the elements of the array as close as possible to each other. If the array already has a large number of identical elements, we can keep them the same. Otherwise, we can try to group similar elements together.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code correctly processes the input and identifies the maximum element in the array.
   - It then creates a new array where each element is transformed such that the difference between the original element and the maximum element is adjusted by a permutation.
   - The new array is sorted, and the code determines the maximum frequency of any number in this transformed array.

4. **Detailed Breakdown**:
   - **Function `func_1()`:** Reads the number of test cases.
   - **Function `func_3()`:** Reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - **Main Logic**:
     - Finds the maximum element in the array.
     - Creates a new array where each element is transformed to `max_element - original_element + 1`.
     - Sorts the new array.
     - Counts the frequency of each unique element in the sorted array.
     - Prints the maximum frequency.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The transformation step ensures that the elements are adjusted to be as close to each other as possible.
   - Sorting the transformed array helps in easily counting the frequencies.
   - The logic to count the maximum frequency is correct and efficient.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It transforms the array to make the elements as close as possible to each other, sorts the transformed array, and then finds the maximum frequency of any number in the sorted array.

### Final Evaluation:
