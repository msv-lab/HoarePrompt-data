Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads the values of \( n \) and \( k \), and a list \( s \) of \( n \) distinct integers. It then swaps the first element of \( s \) with the element at index \( k-1 \). After this swap, it counts the number of elements in \( s \) that are greater than or equal to the first element and stores this count in \( ans \). Next, it swaps the element at index \( p \) (where \( p \) is the position found during the first count) with the element at index \( k-1 \) again, and counts the number of elements in \( s \) that are greater than or equal to the first element after this second swap and stores this count in \( ans1 \). Finally, it prints the maximum value between \( ans \) and \( ans1 \).**
