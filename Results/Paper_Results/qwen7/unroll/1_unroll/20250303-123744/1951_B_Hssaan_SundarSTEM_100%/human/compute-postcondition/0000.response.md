Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable since we don't need to use its value inside the loop.

2. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - Since the loop is controlled by `int(input())`, the number of iterations of the loop is determined by the input.
   - We need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is within the specified range, i.e., `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.

3. **State Before the Loop Starts:**
   - The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
   - For the loop to execute, `t` must be within this range.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `t`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
