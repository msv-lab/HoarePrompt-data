Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case when the hour is `12`. According to the 12-hour format, `12:00` in the 24-hour format should be `12:00 PM`, but the program incorrectly prints `00:00 PM` for `12:00`.

To fix this, the condition for checking if the hour is `12` should be handled separately:

```python
def func_1():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        s = input()
        h = s[:2]
        if h == '12':
            print('12', end='')
        elif h == '00':
            print('12', end='')
        elif int(h) <= 12:
            print(h, end='')
        else:
            print('0{}'.format(int(h) - 12), end='')
        print(s[2:], ['AM', 'PM'][int(h) >= 12])
```

This corrected version ensures that `12:00` is correctly printed as `12:00 PM`.
