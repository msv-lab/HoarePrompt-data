Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the logic and ensure it aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Understanding**: 
   - We need to split a problem of difficulty \( x \) into \( n \) sub-problems such that the sum of the difficulties equals \( x \).
   - The goal is to maximize the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of these \( n \) sub-problems' difficulties.
   
2. **Key Insight**:
   - If we can find a divisor \( d \) of \( x \) such that \( x = d \cdot k \) and \( k \geq n \), then the GCD of the difficulties can be at least \( d \).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over potential divisors \( i \) from 1 to \( \sqrt{x} \).
   - For each divisor \( i \):
     - It checks if \( x - n \cdot i \geq 0 \) and if \( x - n \cdot i \) is divisible by \( i \).
     - It also checks if \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \geq 0 \) and if \( x - n \cdot (x // i) \) is divisible by \( x // i \).
   - The maximum value found during these checks is stored in `ans` and printed at the end.

4. **Examples Verification**:
   - **Example 1**: \( x = 10 \), \( n = 3 \)
     - Possible splits: \( (4, 2, 4) \) with GCD 2.
   - **Example 2**: \( x = 5 \), \( n = 5 \)
     - Only possible split: \( (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) \) with GCD 1.
   - **Example 3**: \( x = 420 \), \( n = 69 \)
     - Possible split: \( (6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6,
