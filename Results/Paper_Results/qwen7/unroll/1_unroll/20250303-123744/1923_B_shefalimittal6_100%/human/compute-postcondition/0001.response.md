Output State: **`n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of `n` monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second, and `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted by the absolute value of the corresponding elements in `x`.**

Explanation: The code sorts the indices of the list `x` based on the absolute value of the elements in `x`. This means that `sorted_indices` will contain the indices of the elements in `x` arranged in ascending order of their absolute values. The lengths and contents of lists `a` and `x`, and the value of `k`, remain unchanged.
