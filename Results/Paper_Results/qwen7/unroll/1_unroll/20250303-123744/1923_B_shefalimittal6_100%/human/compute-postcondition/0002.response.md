Output State: **`distance` is 0, `n` is the length of list `a`, `a` is a list of non-negative integers representing the health of `n` monsters, `x` is a list of integers representing the initial positions of `n` monsters, `k` is a non-negative integer representing the number of bullets that can be fired per second, and `sorted_indices` is a list of indices from `range(n)` sorted by the absolute value of the corresponding elements in `x`.**

The code initializes the variable `distance` to 0. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
