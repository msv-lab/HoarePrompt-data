Reasoning:

1. The program should determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle.
2. The program logic needs to be carefully analyzed to ensure it correctly implements the rules provided in the problem statement.

Let's break down the logic of the program:

- **Case 1:** Both \(a\) and \(b\) are even.
  - The program correctly prints 'yes' in this case, as an even-sized rectangle can always be divided into smaller even-sized rectangles, allowing for the formation of a new rectangle.

- **Case 2:** The difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is equal to \(-a\) or \(-b\).
  - The program incorrectly handles this condition. It should check if \(a - b = a\) or \(b - a = b\), which simplifies to checking if either \(b = 0\) or \(a = 0\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers, this condition is never true. Therefore, the current implementation will always print 'no' for this case, which is incorrect.

- **Case 3:** The difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd.
  - The program incorrectly prints 'yes' in this case. According to the problem statement, if the difference between \(a\) and \(b\) is odd, it does not guarantee that a new rectangle can be formed. For example, a \(3 \times 2\) rectangle can be divided into two \(3 \times 1\) rectangles, but those cannot be recombined to form a new distinct rectangle. Thus, the program should print 'no' for this case.

- **Case 4:** All other cases.
  - The program incorrectly prints 'no' in these cases. According to the problem statement, if neither of the above conditions is met, it is possible to form a new rectangle. For example, a \(2 \times 6\) rectangle can be divided into two \(2 \times 3\) rectangles and recombined to form a \(4 \times 3\) rectangle.

Given the analysis, the program logic is flawed and does not correctly implement the rules provided in the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
