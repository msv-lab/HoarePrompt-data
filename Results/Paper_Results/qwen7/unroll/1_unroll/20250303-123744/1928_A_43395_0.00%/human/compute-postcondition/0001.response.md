Output State: The output consists of 'yes' or 'no' based on the conditions evaluated for each pair of integers (a, b) entered during the iterations. For each test case, if both a and b are even, it prints 'yes'. If the difference between a and b is equal to the negative of either a or b, it prints 'no'. If the difference between a and b is odd, it prints 'yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.
