Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases through a loop where each test case consists of three integers: t, a, and b. For each test case, it checks if t is within the range of 1 to 10^4, and if a and b are within the range of 1 to 10^9. It then processes these values according to some unspecified logic and returns results for each test case.**

Given the constraints and the lack of specific logic in the provided code snippet, the function appears to validate the input values for each test case and proceed with further processing or return specific outputs based on the values of t, a, and b. However, without additional details on the logic inside the function, the exact nature of the return values cannot be specified.
