Reasoning:

The given program attempts to determine whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by analyzing the parity of \(a\) and \(b\) and their difference. However, there are several issues with the logic in the provided code:

1. **Incorrect Condition for Even Parity**: The condition `if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:` correctly identifies when both \(a\) and \(b\) are even. However, the subsequent conditions do not logically follow from this check.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Differences**: The conditions involving differences (`(a - b == -a, a)` and `(b - a == -b, b)`) are incorrectly formatted and do not make sense. These should be simple comparisons like `if a - b == -a` and `if b - a == -b`.

3. **Redundant and Incorrect Conditions**: The condition `elif (a - b) % 2 > 0 or (a - b) % 2 < 0:` is redundant and incorrect. The modulus operation `%` will always return a non-negative result, so `(a - b) % 2 > 0` and `(a - b) % 2 < 0` are mutually exclusive and never true simultaneously.

4. **Logical Flow**: The logic flow is flawed. The conditions should be structured to correctly determine whether another rectangle can be formed based on the given rules.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
