Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` takes the value at index `idx` in the `data` list, converts it to an integer using `int()`, and assigns it to `t`. Since `idx` is initially 0, `t` becomes the integer value of `data[0]`. After this assignment, `idx` is incremented to 1 because the next element in the list would be accessed.
