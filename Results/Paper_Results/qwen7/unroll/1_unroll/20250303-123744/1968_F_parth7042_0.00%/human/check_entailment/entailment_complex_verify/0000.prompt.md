You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

    #State: Output State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing 'NO' repeated `q * (t - 1)` times followed by an empty string.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration processes `n` elements and `q` queries. After processing all `t` iterations, the index `idx` will be incremented by `2 * t` (2 for each iteration), resulting in `idx` being 6. The `results` list will contain `q * (t - 1)` 'NO' responses followed by one empty string, as no conditions for 'YES' were met in the given code snippet.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: NO\nNO\n... (2q times)\n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` integers, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, the function checks if there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` whose bitwise XOR is zero. If such a subarray is found, the result for that query is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'. The function then prints the results for all queries in the order they were processed, followed by an empty line.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the problem as described. Specifically, the program fails to correctly identify interesting subarrays in some cases. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
5 5
1 1 2 3 0
1 5
2 4
3 5
1 3
3 4
```

The program should output:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

However, the program outputs:
```
YES
YES
NO
NO
NO
```

Let's analyze the third query (l=3, r=5):
- Subarray: `[2, 3, 0]`
- Prefix XOR values: `pf = [0, 2, 0, 2, 2]`
- Query: `pf[5] ^ pf[2] = 2 ^ 0 = 2`

The program checks if `x == 0` and finds it is not, so it proceeds to check the positions in the map. However, the positions in the map are not correctly handled for this case. The positions for `pf[5]` and `pf[2]` are `[1, 3, 5]` and `[2]`, respectively. The program incorrectly concludes that the subarray is not interesting.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the positions are correctly checked and that the subarray can be divided into multiple parts with equal XOR values. The current implementation does not correctly handle all edge cases and may miss some interesting subarrays.
