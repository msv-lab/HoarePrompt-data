You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and q are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2⋅10^5; a is a list of n integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < 2^{30}; for each query, l and r are integers such that 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        q = int(data[idx + 1])
        
        idx += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        
        mp = {(0): [0]}
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[idx])
            idx += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            if pf[i] not in mp:
                mp[pf[i]] = []
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[idx])
            r = int(data[idx + 1])
            idx += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp.get(pf[r], [])
            v2 = mp.get(pf[l - 1], [])
            it1 = bisect.bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect.bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] <= r and v2[it2] >= l:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
        results.append('')
        
    #State: Output State: `idx` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing 'NO' repeated `q * (t - 1)` times followed by an empty string.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `t` times, and each iteration processes `n` elements and `q` queries. After processing all `t` iterations, the index `idx` will be incremented by `2 * t` (2 for each iteration), resulting in `idx` being 6. The `results` list will contain `q * (t - 1)` 'NO' responses followed by one empty string, as no conditions for 'YES' were met in the given code snippet.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: NO\nNO\n... (2q times)\n
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t`, followed by `n` and `q` integers, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query consists of two integers `l` and `r`. For each test case, the function processes the queries and returns the results of these queries.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
