Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
2. It processes each test case individually, extracting `n`, `q`, the array `a`, and the queries.
3. For each test case, it calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) values for the array `a`.
4. It uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each prefix XOR value to the indices where it occurs.
5. For each query, it determines the XOR value of the subarray `[l, r]` using the prefix XOR values.
6. If the XOR value is zero, it directly appends 'YES' to the results.
7. Otherwise, it checks if there exist indices in the mapped lists that satisfy the conditions for the subarray to be interesting.
8. The program handles multiple test cases and queries correctly, printing the results with the required format.

Given the detailed explanation and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the logic correctly as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
