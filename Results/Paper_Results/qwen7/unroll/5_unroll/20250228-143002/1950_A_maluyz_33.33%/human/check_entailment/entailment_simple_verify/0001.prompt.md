You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a == b == c:
            print('NONE')
        elif max(a, b, c) == b:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of strings printed during each iteration of the loop based on the comparison of three integers (`a`, `b`, and `c`) entered for each iteration. Specifically, for each line of input, if `a < b < c`, it prints 'STAIR'; if `a == b == c`, it prints 'NONE'; if `max(a, b, c) == b`, it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. This process repeats `t` times, where `t` is the initial integer input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each case.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `a < b < c`. If this condition is true, it prints 'STAIR'.
   - The program checks if `a == b == c`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NONE'. This is a correct check for the case where all three digits are the same.
   - The program checks if the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c` is `b`. If this condition is true, it prints 'PEAK'.
   - For any other case, it prints 'NONE'.

### Issues with the Program:
- The condition `elif a == b == c:` is redundant because if `a == b == c`, it cannot be a stair or a peak. Therefore, this condition should not be included.
- The condition `elif max(a, b, c) == b:` is not sufficient to determine a peak. It only checks if `b` is the maximum value, but it does not ensure that `a < b > c`.

### Correct Conditions:
- To correctly identify a stair, the condition should be `a < b < c`.
- To correctly identify a peak, the condition should be `a < b > c`.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has issues with the conditions used to determine a peak. Based on the analysis, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
