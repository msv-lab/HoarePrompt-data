Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. All other variables remain in their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered by the user, converted to an integer, and it must be within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `n` and `a` (which are defined later in the code) remain unchanged from their initial state.
