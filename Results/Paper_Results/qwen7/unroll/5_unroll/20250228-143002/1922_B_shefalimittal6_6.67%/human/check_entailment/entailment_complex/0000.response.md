Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle.
2. A non-degenerate triangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side.
3. Given the lengths of the sticks are \(2^{a_i}\), the condition for forming a triangle translates to the condition that for any three sticks with lengths \(2^{a_1}\), \(2^{a_2}\), and \(2^{a_3}\), the following must hold: \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} > 2^{a_3}\), \(2^{a_1} + 2^{a_3} > 2^{a_2}\), and \(2^{a_2} + 2^{a_3} > 2^{a_1}\).
4. Since \(2^x\) is an increasing function, this condition simplifies to ensuring that no single stick is longer than the sum of the other two sticks. This means we need to ensure that for any three indices \(i < j < k\), \(2^{a_i} + 2^{a_j} > 2^{a_k}\).
5. The provided code attempts to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks that satisfy this condition by counting the frequency of each stick length and then using combinatorial calculations.
6. However, the logic in the code does not correctly account for the triangle inequality condition. Specifically, the code counts combinations without checking if the selected sticks can actually form a triangle.
7. The code should iterate through the sorted unique stick lengths and check the triangle inequality condition for every combination of three sticks.

Given the above reasoning, the provided code is incorrect because it does not properly implement the logic to check the triangle inequality condition.

Correctness: **False**
