Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Minimum Invitations**: The program attempts to find a specific pattern (`p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`) to decide the minimum number of invitations needed. This logic is overly simplistic and does not cover all possible scenarios where the minimum number of invitations required could be 2 or 3.

2. **Index Handling**: The loop `while i <= n - 1:` is problematic because it should iterate through the list `l` properly without assuming a fixed step size. Also, the condition `p[i] == i + 2 and p[i + 1] == i + 1` is too restrictive and may miss valid cases where the minimum number of invitations is 2.

3. **Handling All Test Cases**: The program does not handle all test cases correctly. For example, in the third test case where `n=2` and `p=[2, 1]`, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`.

Given these issues, the program does not accurately determine the minimum number of invitations required for each test case.

Correctness: **False**
