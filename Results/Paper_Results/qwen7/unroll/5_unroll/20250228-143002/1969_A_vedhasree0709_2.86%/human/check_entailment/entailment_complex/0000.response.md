Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The program only checks for a specific condition (`p[i] == i + 2` and `p[i + 1] == i + 1`) which is not the general solution to the problem.
3. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. The given solution does not account for all possible configurations of the `p` list.
4. The program should iterate over all possible pairs of friends and check if sending invitations to those pairs results in at least 2 friends coming to the party. The current implementation only checks for a single pair and always prints 2 or 3 without considering the actual constraints and requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
