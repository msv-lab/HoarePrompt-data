Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider scenarios where no two consecutive elements in the list satisfy the condition `l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1`. For example, in the third test case where `n = 2` and `p = [2, 1]`, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`. In this case, Monocarp can invite both friends 1 and 2, and both will attend. However, the program logic does not account for this scenario properly.
