### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.
   - Fireworks from the first installation are launched every `a` minutes.
   - Fireworks from the second installation are launched every `b` minutes.
   - Each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes after launch.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.
   - It calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period of `m` minutes using the formulas:
     \[
     A = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
     \[
     B = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1
     \]
   - The code then prints the sum `A + B`.

3. **Overlap Consideration**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the sum `A + B` overcounts the overlapping fireworks.
   - To avoid overcounting, we need to subtract the number of overlapping fireworks, which is given by:
     \[
     \text{Overlaps} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{LCM}(a, b)} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Therefore, the correct formula should be:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 1 - \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{LCM}(a, b)} \right\rfloor
     \]

4. **Code Implementation**:
   - The given code does not implement the correct formula. Instead, it simply sums `A` and `B` without subtracting the overlaps.
   - This means the code will overestimate the number of fireworks that can be seen simultaneously.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The given code does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The given code does not correctly solve the problem due to the lack of consideration for the overlap of fireworks from both installations.
