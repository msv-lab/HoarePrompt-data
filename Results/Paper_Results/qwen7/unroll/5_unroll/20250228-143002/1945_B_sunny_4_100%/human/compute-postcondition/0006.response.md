Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) (where \(1 \leq a, b, m \leq 10^{18}\)), calculates the value of \(ans\) as \(\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor + 2\), and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the calculated values for each case.**
