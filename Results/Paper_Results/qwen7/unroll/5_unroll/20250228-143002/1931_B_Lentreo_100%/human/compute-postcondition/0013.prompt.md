You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, where the length of nums is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5) and the sum of the integers in nums is divisible by n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^9).
def func_1(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total = sum(nums)
    if (total % n != 0) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `nums` is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, `n` is the length of `nums`, `total` is the sum of all elements in `nums`. The total sum of `nums` is divisible by `n`.
    mean = total // n
    curr = 0
    for i in range(n):
        curr += nums[i] - mean
        
        if curr < 0:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: curr is -n, nums is a list of integers representing the amounts of water in each container, n is the length of nums, total is the sum of all elements in nums, and mean is the integer division of total by n.
    #
    #Explanation: After iterating through all elements in `nums`, `curr` accumulates the difference between each element and the mean. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. If the loop completes without returning, `curr` will be the sum of all differences from the mean, which is equivalent to `-n` because each element in `nums` contributes to making `curr` less than 0 exactly once before the loop ends.
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 'YES' if it's possible to partition the list into `n` non-empty parts such that the sum of each part is equal, otherwise it returns 'NO'.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'NO'

Case_2: The program returns 'YES'


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
