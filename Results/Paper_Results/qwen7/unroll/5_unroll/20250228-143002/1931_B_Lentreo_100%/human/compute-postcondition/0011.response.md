The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. The length of `nums` is `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), and the sum of the integers in `nums` is divisible by `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9). 

The function returns 'NO' in Case_1 and 'YES' in Case_2.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions, though the specific conditions leading to 'YES' or 'NO' are not detailed here.
