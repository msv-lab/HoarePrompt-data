### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program correctly checks if the total sum of water in all containers is divisible by \( n \). This is a necessary condition for the containers to be able to have the same amount of water after operations. If the sum is not divisible by \( n \), it's impossible to achieve the goal, and the program correctly returns 'NO'.

2. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have, which is \( \text{mean} = \frac{\text{total}}{n} \). This value represents the target amount of water each container should have if it were evenly distributed.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the mean can be balanced out without going negative. This check ensures that the water can be redistributed among the containers to reach the mean value. If at any point the difference goes negative, it indicates that it's impossible to balance the containers to have the same amount, and the program correctly returns 'NO'.
   - The final check ensures that the accumulated difference `curr` is not negative, which confirms that the redistribution process is feasible.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program handles all potential cases correctly. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem description and examples.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
