Output State: **`len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically, and `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is reversed compared to its original position in `unique_chars`; `decoded` is a string obtained by mapping each character in `encoded` using the `char_map`**.

Explanation: The code creates a new string `decoded` by mapping each character in `encoded` using the `char_map` dictionary. The `char_map` dictionary is constructed such that the first character in `unique_chars` maps to the last character, the second character maps to the second last character, and so on. The lengths and contents of `unique_chars` and `char_map` remain unchanged, but a new variable `decoded` is introduced, which contains the decoded string based on the mapping defined in `char_map`.
