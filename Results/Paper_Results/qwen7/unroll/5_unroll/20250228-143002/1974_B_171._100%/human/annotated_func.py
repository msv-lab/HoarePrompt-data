#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s using the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`, `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters from `encoded`, sorted alphabetically, and `char_map` is a dictionary where each key-value pair is reversed compared to its original position in `unique_chars`. Specifically, the first character in `unique_chars` maps to the last character, the second character maps to the second last character, and so on.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string `decoded` which is obtained by mapping each character in `encoded` using the `char_map` dictionary, where the keys and values of `char_map` are reversed compared to their original positions in the sorted list `unique_chars`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` and returns a new string `decoded`. This `decoded` string is generated by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding character based on a dictionary `char_map`, where the keys and values of `char_map` are reversed compared to their original positions in the sorted list of unique characters from `encoded`.
