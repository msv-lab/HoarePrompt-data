Reasoning:
1. The program correctly separates the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists.
2. It checks if both `letters` and `digits` are sorted in non-decreasing order.
3. It ensures that there are no lowercase letters followed immediately by a digit.
4. If any of these conditions fail, the program correctly returns 'NO'.
5. If all conditions pass, the program correctly returns 'YES'.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the annotated program, the program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
