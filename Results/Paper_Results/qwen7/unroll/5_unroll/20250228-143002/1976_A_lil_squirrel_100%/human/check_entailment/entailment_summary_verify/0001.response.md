Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the password `n` and the password itself.
3. It separates the characters into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
4. It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
5. It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it returns 'NO'.
6. It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter. If this condition is violated, it returns 'NO'.
7. If all conditions are satisfied, it returns 'YES'.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the conditions specified for a strong password as per the problem description. Let's break down the function and the overall logic:

- The function separates the characters into `letters` and `digits` lists.
- It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- It iterates through the password to ensure that no digit comes after a letter.

Given the function summary and the implementation, the program indeed verifies the password according to the specified conditions. The original assessment accurately describes the functionality and the correctness of the program.

Final: **True**
