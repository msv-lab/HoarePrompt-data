Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` because `range(len(password) - 1)` generates values from `0` to `len(password) - 2`.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < len(password) - 1`.

4. **Check the state of `password`**: Since `password` is a string of length `n` (where `1 <= n <= 20`), the maximum value of `len(password) - 1` is `19` (since `n` can be at most `20`).

5. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should start at `0` and the length of `password` should be at least `1` (so that `len(password) - 1` is a valid non-negative integer).

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:
- `i` should be `0`.
- `password` should be a string of length at least `1`.

Since the state of `letters`, `digits`, and `n` does not directly affect the loop's execution, they do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`i` is 0, password is a string of length at least 1**.

So, the answer is:
State: **`i` is 0, password is a string of length at least 1**.
