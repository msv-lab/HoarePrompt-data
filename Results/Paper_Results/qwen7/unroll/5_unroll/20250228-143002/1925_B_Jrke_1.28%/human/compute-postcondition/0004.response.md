Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three integers \( t \), \( x \), and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum divisor of \( x \) that is less than or equal to \( x // n \). If \( x // n = 1 \), it prints 1. Otherwise, it iterates through possible divisors of \( x \), checks if they are valid based on the condition, and keeps track of the maximum valid divisor. Finally, it prints the maximum valid divisor found for each test case.**
