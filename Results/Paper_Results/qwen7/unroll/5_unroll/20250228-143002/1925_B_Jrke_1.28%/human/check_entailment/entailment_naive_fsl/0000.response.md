Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n` is greater than `x`. In such a case, the GCD of the difficulties cannot be greater than 1 because the only divisors of a prime number are 1 and itself. However, the program does not ensure that the GCD is maximized under these conditions.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
7 3
```
The program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `7` because the only way to split 7 into 3 parts is `[1, 1, 5]` or `[1, 5, 1]` or `[5, 1, 1]`, and the GCD of these parts is 1, which is not the maximum possible balance.

To fix this, the program needs to handle the case where `x` is a prime number and `n > x` by setting the GCD to `x` directly.
