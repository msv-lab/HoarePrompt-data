Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program sets `l` to `'YES'` as soon as it finds a character in `a` and `b` that does not match the corresponding character in `c`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not ensure that both `a` and `b` match the template while `c` does not.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4
2
aa
bb
ab
```

The program will output "YES", but according to the problem description, there is no template that satisfies the conditions for this input. Both `a` and `b` would need to match the template, and `c` would need to not match it. In this case, if we use the template "AA", both `a` and `b` match, but `c` also matches, so the program incorrectly outputs "YES".

To fix this, the program needs to check if both `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not match the template after constructing the template based on the characters in `a`, `b`, and `c`.
