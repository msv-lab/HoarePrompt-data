Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, it compares the characters at each index of strings a, b, and c. If for any index i, the characters in a and c are different and the characters in b and c are also different, it sets the variable l to 'YES'. Otherwise, it sets l to 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it prints the value of l for each test case.
