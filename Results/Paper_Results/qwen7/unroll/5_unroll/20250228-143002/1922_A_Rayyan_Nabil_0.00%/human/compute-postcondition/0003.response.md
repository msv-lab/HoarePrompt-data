Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is determined by the loop execution, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `l` will be set to 'NO' if for every string `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. If there exists at least one index `i` where both conditions fail, then `l` remains 'YES'. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` do not change during the loop execution.
