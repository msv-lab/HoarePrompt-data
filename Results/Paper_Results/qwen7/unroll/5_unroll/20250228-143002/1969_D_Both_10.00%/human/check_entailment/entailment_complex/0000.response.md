Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
   - It correctly initializes the variables needed for processing each test case.
   - The function is correctly implemented to read the number of test cases and return it as an integer.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads and returns the values of \( n \) and \( k \) for each test case.
   - It also reads and returns the lists \( a \) and \( b \).
   - The function is correctly implemented to read and process the input for each test case.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - This function calculates the sum of the differences between the prices for Alice and Bob for the items in `main_ar` where the difference is non-negative.
   - The logic in `func_3` is correct and aligns with the problem statement.
   - However, the function name suggests it might be used in a different context within the main program, but its implementation is correct.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program processes each test case by:
     - Reading \( n \) and \( k \).
     - Reading the lists \( a \) and \( b \).
     - Sorting the items based on \( b_i \).
     - Using a heap to manage the items that Bob will take for free.
     - Calculating the maximum possible profit for Alice by considering different scenarios.
   - The logic for managing the heap and calculating the profit is correct and follows the problem constraints.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate Alice's profit under the given conditions. The functions are correctly implemented and the main logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
