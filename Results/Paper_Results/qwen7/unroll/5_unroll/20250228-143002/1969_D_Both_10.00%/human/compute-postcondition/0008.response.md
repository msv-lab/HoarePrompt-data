Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers, both of the same length. It calculates the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0, and returns this sum.**
