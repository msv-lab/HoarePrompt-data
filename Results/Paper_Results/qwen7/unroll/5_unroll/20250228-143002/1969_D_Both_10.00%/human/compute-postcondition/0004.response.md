Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for val_b in main_ar`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `val_b` and `main_ar`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `sub_summ` is the sum of the first element of each sublist in `sec_arr`. This information is not directly relevant to the loop head but rather to the loop body.
   - `main_ar` is the list being iterated over, and `val_b` is the variable that takes on the value of each element in `main_ar` during each iteration.

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `main_ar` must contain at least one element. If `main_ar` is empty, the loop will not execute.
   - The variable `val_b` will take on the value of the first element in `main_ar` during the first iteration.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `main_ar` and `val_b`.

**State:**
- `main_ar` must contain at least one element.
- `val_b` must be initialized to the first element of `main_ar`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`main_ar` must contain at least one element, `val_b` is the first element of `main_ar`**.
