To determine if the given program is correct, let's analyze the logic step-by-step and compare it with the problem description.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - Each test case contains `n` and `k`.
   - Followed by `n` values for `a_i` and `n` values for `b_i`.

2. **Objective**:
   - Alice wants to maximize her profit.
   - Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
   - If Alice buys less than `k` items, Bob can take all of them for free.
   - Otherwise, Bob takes `k` items for free and pays for the remaining items.

3. **Profit Calculation**:
   - Alice's profit is calculated as `profit = ∑ b_i - ∑ a_j`, where `S` is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and `T` is the set of items Alice buys from the shop.

### Given Program Analysis

The provided code seems to have some issues and is incomplete. Here is a breakdown of the functions:

1. **func_1()**: This function is supposed to read an integer from input. However, the implementation is incomplete and uses `putin()` which is not defined.
2. **func_2()**: This function is supposed to read multiple integers from input. Similar to `func_1`, it uses `putin()` which is not defined.
3. **func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)**: This function is supposed to calculate a sum based on the input arrays. However, the logic inside this function does not align with the problem description.

### Correct Approach

Given the complexity of the problem, a more appropriate approach would involve:

1. **Sorting the Items**: Sort the items based on the difference `b_i - a_i` in descending order.
2. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - If `k` is 0, Alice can maximize her profit by buying all items and selling them to Bob.
   - If `k` is greater than 0, Alice should buy items such that the total cost `a_i` is minimized while maximizing the benefit `b_i`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import heapq

def solve(n, k, a, b):
    # Calculate the difference b_i - a_i
    differences = sorted((b[i] - a[i], i) for i in range(n))
    
    # Calculate the maximum profit
    max_profit = 0
    if k == 0:
        max_profit = sum(b)
    else:
        # Take the top k items with the highest b_i - a_i
        k_items = [(-diff, i) for diff, i in differences[:k]]
        heapq.heapify(k_items)
        
        # Calculate the cost of the remaining items
        remaining_cost = sum(a[i] for _, i in differences[k:])
        
        # Calculate the benefit of the k items
        k_benefit = sum(b[i] for _, i in k_items)
        
        max_profit = k_benefit - remaining_cost
    
    return max_profit

# Reading input
t = int(input())
results = []

for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results.append(solve(n, k, a, b))

# Output results
for result in results:
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion

The given program is **incorrect** because it does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

**False**
