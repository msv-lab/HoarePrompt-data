You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game in the shop. There are n items in the shop;
each item has two parameters: a_i (item price for Alice) and b_i (item price
for Bob).

Alice wants to choose a subset (possibly empty) of items and buy them. After
that, Bob does the following:

  * if Alice bought less than k items, Bob can take all of them for free; 
  * otherwise, he will take k items for free that Alice bought (Bob chooses which k items it will be), and for the rest of the chosen items, Bob will buy them from Alice and pay b_i for the i -th item. 

Alice's profit is equal to \sum\limits_{i \in S} b_i - \sum\limits_{j \in T}
a_j , where S is the set of items Bob buys from Alice, and T is the set of
items Alice buys from the shop. In other words, Alice's profit is the
difference between the amount Bob pays her and the amount she spends buying
the items.

Alice wants to maximize her profit, Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit. Your
task is to calculate Alice's profit if both Alice and Bob act optimally.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ; 0 \le k \le n ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n (1 \le b_i \le 10^9 ).

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases doesn't
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — Alice's profit if both Alice and
Bob act optimally.

Output

Note

In the first test case, Alice should buy the 2 -nd item and sell it to Bob, so
her profit is 2 - 1 = 1 .

In the second test case, Alice should buy the 1 -st, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd
item; then Bob takes the 1 -st item for free and pays for the 2 -nd and the 3
-rd item. Alice's profit is (3+2) - (1+2+1) = 1 . Bob could take 2 -nd item
for free instead; this does not change Alice's profit. Bob won't take the 3
-rd item for free, since this would lead to a profit of 2 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    return int(putin())

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    return map(int, putin().split())

#Function 3:
def func_3(main_ar, sec_arr):
    sub_summ = 0
    for val_a in sec_arr:
        sub_summ += val_a[0]
    for val_b in main_ar:
        if val_b[0] + val_b[1] >= 0:
            sub_summ += val_b[0] + val_b[1]
    return sub_summ



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers, both of the same length. It calculates the sum of the first and second elements of each tuple in `main_ar` where their sum is greater than or equal to 0, and returns this sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_3` does not handle the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob as required.

The function `func_3` seems to be attempting to calculate a sum based on some conditions, but it does not address the core logic of the game. Here’s why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Strategy for Alice**: The function `func_3` does not consider the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize her profit. It simply sums up certain values without considering the constraints and the interaction between Alice and Bob.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Bob's Actions**: The function does not account for Bob's actions, such as taking items for free or paying for items based on the number of items Alice buys. It does not implement the logic where Bob can take up to `k` items for free if Alice buys fewer than `k` items.

3. **Lack of Dynamic Programming or Greedy Approach**: The problem requires a more sophisticated approach to solve optimally, such as using dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to consider all possible subsets of items Alice could buy and the corresponding profits.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to implement a more complex algorithm that considers all possible choices Alice can make and the corresponding outcomes based on Bob's actions. This involves evaluating different scenarios and choosing the one that maximizes Alice's profit.

Since the provided code does not implement the necessary logic, it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
