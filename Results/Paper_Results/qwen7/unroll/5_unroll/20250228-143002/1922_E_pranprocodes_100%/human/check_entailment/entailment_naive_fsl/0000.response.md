Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences specified by \(X\). Instead, it attempts to construct an array using a pattern based on maximum and minimum values, which does not guarantee the correct number of increasing subsequences.

For instance, consider the input \(X = 3\):

- The program will output an array like \([-1, 0, 0]\), which does not have exactly 3 increasing subsequences. The possible increasing subsequences are \([-1], [0], [0]\), totaling 3, but the construction method does not ensure this specific count.

Another example is \(X = 5\):

- The program might output \([-1, -1, 0, 0]\), which again does not necessarily have exactly 5 increasing subsequences.

The program fails to address the core requirement of constructing an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences, making it incorrect.
