Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic for calculating the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. The current implementation uses `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which does not guarantee that the next year is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

The correct calculation should be:
- First sign occurs in year 3.
- Second sign occurs in year 4 (after the first sign).
- Third sign occurs in year 8 (after the second sign).
- Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (after the third sign).
- Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (after the fourth sign).
- Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (after the fifth sign).

However, the program's logic might incorrectly calculate the next year, leading to an incorrect result. For instance, if `last_year` is 3 and `a[i]` is 2, the program calculates the next year as 6 instead of 4, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should use a more straightforward approach to ensure the next year is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence. A correct approach would be to simply add `a[i]` to `last_year` for each subsequent sign, ensuring the next year is always strictly after the previous one.
