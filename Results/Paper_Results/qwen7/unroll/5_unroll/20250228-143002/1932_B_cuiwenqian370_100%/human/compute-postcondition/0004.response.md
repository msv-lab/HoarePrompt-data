Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the list `data` at position `index`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` was set to 1, so after executing this line, `index` becomes 2. The values of `T`, `n`, and `t` remain unchanged.
