Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the year when all signs will occur sequentially. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Next Year:**
   - The current implementation calculates the next year using `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which is not necessary and can be simplified.
   - Instead, you should simply add `a[i]` to `last_year` until `last_year` is a multiple of `a[i]`.

2. **Logic Simplification:**
   - For each sign, you need to find the smallest year that is a multiple of its periodicity and greater than or equal to the previous year plus one.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = 0
        for i in range(n):
            next_year = last_year + a[i]
            while next_year % a[i] != 0:
                next_year += 1
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

This corrected version ensures that the next year is correctly calculated as the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
