Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input for multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it initializes the variable `last_year` with the first value of the list `a`.
3. It then iterates through the remaining values in the list `a`, calculating the next year when the sign would occur based on the current `last_year` and the next value in the list. This calculation ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.
4. The program correctly updates `last_year` to the calculated next year and repeats this process until all signs are considered.
5. Finally, it appends the last calculated year to the results list and outputs these results.

Given the logic and steps followed in the program, it aligns with the problem statement and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
