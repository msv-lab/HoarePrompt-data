Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. Input reading is now done using `sys.stdin.read`.**

Explanation: The line `input = sys.stdin.read` replaces the built-in `input()` function with `sys.stdin.read()`. This changes how input is read from standard input, but does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of these variables remain unchanged.
