Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the standard input (using `input()`) and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace (`split()`). The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, but `data` is now a list of strings resulting from the split operation.
