You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then calculates a sequence of numbers based on the initial number in the list and the subsequent numbers, updating the last number in the sequence iteratively. After processing all test cases, it writes the final calculated number for each test case to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, the logic for calculating the next year when a sign will occur is flawed. The current implementation uses `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`, which does not guarantee that the next year is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```

The correct calculation should be:
- First sign occurs in year 3.
- Second sign occurs in year 4 (after the first sign).
- Third sign occurs in year 8 (after the second sign).
- Fourth sign occurs in year 10 (after the third sign).
- Fifth sign occurs in year 18 (after the fourth sign).
- Sixth sign occurs in year 36 (after the fifth sign).

However, the program's logic might incorrectly calculate the next year, leading to an incorrect result. For instance, if `last_year` is 3 and `a[i]` is 2, the program calculates the next year as 6 instead of 4, which is incorrect.

To fix this, the program should use a more straightforward approach to ensure the next year is strictly after the previous sign's occurrence. A correct approach would be to simply add `a[i]` to `last_year` for each subsequent sign, ensuring the next year is always strictly after the previous one.
