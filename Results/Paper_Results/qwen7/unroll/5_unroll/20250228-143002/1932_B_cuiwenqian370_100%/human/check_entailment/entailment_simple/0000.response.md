### Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading and Parsing:**
   - The program reads input from stdin using `sys.stdin.read`, which is a common approach to handle multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It splits the input into tokens and uses an index to keep track of the current position in the data.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - The variable `last_year` is initialized with the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculation of Next Year:**
   - The logic for calculating the next year when the next sign will occur is correct. Specifically, the line:
     ```python
     next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
     ```
     This ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

4. **Updating `last_year`:**
   - After calculating `next_year`, `last_year` is updated to this new value, ensuring that the next iteration waits for the correct year.

5. **Appending Results:**
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list as a string representation of the final `last_year`.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, the results are joined by newlines and written to stdout.

Given that the logic for determining the next year and updating the `last_year` is correct, and the overall structure of the program handles the input and output as specified, the program should work correctly for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
