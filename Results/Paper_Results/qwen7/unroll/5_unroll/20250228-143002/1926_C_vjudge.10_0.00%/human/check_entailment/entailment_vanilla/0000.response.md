Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Analysis
- The task is to replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits and then find the sum of these new values.
- The given program does not correctly implement this logic. Instead, it attempts to call `func_1(i)` for each integer from 0 to \( N-1 \), which is not what the problem requires.

### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - `soma` is initialized to 0.
   - `N` is read from input, but it is not used in the loop.
   - For each test case, `n` is read from input.
   - A loop runs from 0 to \( n-1 \), calling `func_1(i)` for each value of `i`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, iterates over each character, converts it back to an integer, and sums these values.

### Correctness Check
- The program does not correctly replace each integer from 1 to \( n \) with the sum of its digits.
- It instead replaces each integer from 0 to \( n-1 \) with the sum of its digits, which is not required by the problem statement.

### Example Walkthrough
- For \( n = 12 \):
  - The program will compute the sum of digits for 0 through 11.
  - This results in: \( 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 46 \).
  - The expected result should be 51, but the program gives 46.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's requirements. It processes numbers from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of from 1 to \( n \).

**Correctness: **False**
