Output State: **`ans` is an empty string, `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is the length of `s`.**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `ans` as an empty string. The initial conditions for `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, `s` is still a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")", and it is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000; `n` is still the length of `s`.
