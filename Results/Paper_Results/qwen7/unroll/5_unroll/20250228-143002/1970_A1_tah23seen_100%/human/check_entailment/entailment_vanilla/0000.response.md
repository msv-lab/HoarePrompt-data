Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Function Call**:
   - The program reads an input string `s` which is a balanced parentheses sequence.
   - It calls a function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes a string `s` as input.
   - It initializes an empty string `ans` to store the final result.
   - It uses a dictionary `d` to keep track of the balance at each position.
     - `d[0] = 0` initializes the balance at the start.
     - For each character in the string, it updates the balance:
       - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
       - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
     - After processing all characters, it removes the entry for the last position `n` from the dictionary.
   - It sorts the dictionary items based on the balance values (in ascending order) and positions (in descending order).
   - Finally, it constructs the result string `ans` by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions.

### Checking the Correctness

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The balance calculation is correctly implemented. The dictionary `d` keeps track of the balance at each position, which is essential for the next steps.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The sorting logic is almost correct but needs a small adjustment. The current implementation sorts the dictionary items using `sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))`. However, the keys should be sorted in increasing order of balance and then in decreasing order of position. The current implementation sorts in the opposite order for the position part (`-x[0]`).

3. **Constructing the Result**:
   - The construction of the result string `ans` by iterating over the sorted dictionary is correct. It appends the characters at the sorted positions to `ans`.

### Corrected Sorting Logic

To fix the sorting issue, the lambda function in the `sorted` call should be adjusted to sort by balance in ascending order and by position in descending order. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {0: 0}
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]), reverse=True)
    for (i, _) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans
```

### Final Conclusion

After reviewing the code and making the necessary adjustments, the original program is almost correct but requires a minor change in the sorting logic. Therefore, the original program is **not fully correct** due to the sorting issue.

### Correctness: **False**
