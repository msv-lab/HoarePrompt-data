Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners.
2. The solution correctly processes multiple test cases.
3. For each test case, it reads four points and stores them in a list `a`.
4. It extracts the x-coordinates into a list `x` and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
5. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the distance between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates will be equal to the side length of the square. Therefore, squaring this difference gives the area of the square.
6. The solution does not consider the y-coordinates, but since the square is aligned with the axes, the side length is determined solely by the x-coordinates, and the same logic applies to the y-coordinates.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
