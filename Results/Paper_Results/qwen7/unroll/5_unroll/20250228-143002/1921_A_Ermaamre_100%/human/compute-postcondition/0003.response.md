Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list of coordinates representing the vertices of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, given four lines of input for each test case, each containing two integers x_i, y_i such that -1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000, and it is guaranteed that the given points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area.**

This means the function is expected to process input data for multiple test cases, where each test case provides four points (x_i, y_i) forming a square. The function should then determine and return the coordinates of the vertices of this square.
