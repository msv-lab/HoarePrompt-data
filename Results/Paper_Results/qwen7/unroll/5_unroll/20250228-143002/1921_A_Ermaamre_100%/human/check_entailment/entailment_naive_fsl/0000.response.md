Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners. It extracts the x-coordinates and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which gives the side length of the square. Squaring this difference gives the area of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates will always equal the difference in y-coordinates, ensuring the correct area calculation. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
