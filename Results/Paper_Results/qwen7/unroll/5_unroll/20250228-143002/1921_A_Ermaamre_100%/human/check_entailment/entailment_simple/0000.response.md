Reasoning:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Extracting Coordinates**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates (each pair representing a corner of the square) and stores them in a list `a`.
3. **Finding the Side Length**: It extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`). This difference represents the side length of the square.
4. **Calculating Area**: The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx` and printed.

Given that the problem guarantees that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, the method of finding the side length by computing the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates is valid. Since the area of a square is simply the side length squared, the solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
