You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a = [[int(x) for x in input().split()] for i in range(4)]
        x = [p[0] for p in a]
        dx = max(x) - min(x)
        print(dx * dx)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four points forming a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. For each test case, it calculates and prints the area of the square by computing the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the given points.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the coordinates of the four corners. It extracts the x-coordinates and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates, which gives the side length of the square. Squaring this difference gives the area of the square. Since the square's sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, the difference in x-coordinates will always equal the difference in y-coordinates, ensuring the correct area calculation. Given the constraints and guarantees in the problem description, the program handles all potential cases correctly.
