You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

- Program:
n_test = int(input())
answers = [None] * n_test
for test in range(n_test):
    (n, m) = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    array = input().split()
    total_digits = 0
    zeros = []
    for item in array:
        total_digits += len(item)
        if func_1(item) > 0:
            zeros.append(func_1(item))
    zeros = sorted(zeros, reverse=True)
    subtract_zero = 0
    for i in range(0, len(zeros), 2):
        subtract_zero += zeros[i]
    if abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1:
        answers[test] = 'Sashah'
    else:
        answers[test] = 'Anna'
for answer in answers:
    print(answer)

def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
    return counter



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the count of zeros from the end of the list until the first non-zero element. If there are no zeros at the end, it returns zero.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic for determining the winner of the game based on the given rules and problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n_test`.
   - It initializes an array `answers` to store the results for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`.
   - It then reads the list of integers from the input and splits it into individual strings (which are treated as numbers).

3. **Calculating Total Digits and Counting Leading Zeros:**
   - It calculates the total number of digits in the list.
   - It counts the number of leading zeros in each number using the function `func_1`.

4. **Sorting and Processing Leading Zeros:**
   - It sorts the count of leading zeros in descending order.
   - It processes pairs of leading zeros, subtracting their counts from the total digit count.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - It checks if the absolute difference between the total digit count and the subtracted zero count is greater than or equal to `m + 1`.
   - If true, it assigns 'Sasha' to the result for that test case.
   - Otherwise, it assigns 'Anna'.

6. **Outputting Results:**
   - It prints the results for each test case.

### Function `func_1` Analysis
- The function `func_1` counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of a number.
- This function is used to count leading zeros in the context of the main logic.

### Correctness Check
- **Logic for Determining the Winner:**
  - The logic in the program seems to be checking if the remaining length of the numbers after removing leading zeros is sufficient to form a number greater than \(10^m\).
  - This is a simplified version of the logic required to determine the winner, but it does not fully capture the complexity of the game's rules.

### Issues Identified
1. **Incorrect Functionality:**
   - The function `func_1` counts trailing zeros, not leading zeros.
   - The logic for processing leading zeros and determining the winner is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the game's rules where players can reverse digits and concatenate numbers.

2. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented:**
   - The program does not simulate the game properly. It does not account for the actual moves of reversing digits and concatenating numbers.
   - The logic to determine the winner based on the game rules is not implemented correctly.

### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner based on the game rules. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
