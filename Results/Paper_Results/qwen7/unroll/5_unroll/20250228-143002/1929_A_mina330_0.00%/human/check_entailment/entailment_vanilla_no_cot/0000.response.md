Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program aims to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting the array and then pairing the smallest half with the largest half, but this approach does not always yield the maximum beauty.

To find the maximum beauty, we should consider the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The goal is to maximize the sum of these differences. The optimal strategy is to sort the array and then pair the smallest element with the second-largest element, the third-smallest with the second-smallest, and so on. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - i - 1] - a[i]
        if n % 2 != 0:
            kq -= a[n // 2]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This corrected program correctly calculates the maximum beauty by considering the differences between pairs of elements in the sorted array.
