Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of the array \(a\) by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. The given solution correctly sorts the array \(a\). Sorting helps in maximizing the beauty because the difference between the largest and smallest elements in pairs will be maximized when the array is sorted.

3. After sorting, the solution calculates the beauty by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This is done by iterating through the first half of the sorted array and adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the array.

4. The logic of the solution is sound and matches the problem requirements. It correctly calculates the maximum possible beauty by leveraging the sorted order of the array.

5. The solution handles multiple test cases as expected, processing each one independently.

Given the above points, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
