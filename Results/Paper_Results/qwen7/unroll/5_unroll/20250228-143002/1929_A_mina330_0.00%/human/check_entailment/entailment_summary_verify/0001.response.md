### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array \( a \).
   - It calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the largest elements are paired with the smallest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.
   - By pairing the largest element with the smallest, the second largest with the second smallest, and so on, we ensure that the sum of the differences is maximized.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, the solution correctly pairs them.
   - If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element does not participate in the pairing, but this does not affect the maximization of the beauty since the middle element is either the largest or the smallest in the sorted array.

5. **Verification**:
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement confirm the correctness of the solution.

However, upon closer inspection, the given solution does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. The issue lies in how the differences are being summed. The current implementation sums the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.

For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. The current solution would sort the array to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and then calculate the beauty as:
\[ (100 - 43) + (90 - 54) + (80 - 80) = 57 + 36 + 0 = 93 \]

However, the optimal arrangement to maximize the beauty would be `[100, 54, 90, 80, 43]`, which gives:
\[ (100 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (80 - 43) = 46 + 10 + 37 = 93 \]

But the current solution only considers the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs, which does not always yield the maximum beauty.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly maximize the beauty, we should pair the largest element with the second smallest, the second largest with the third smallest, and so on. This can be achieved by sorting the array and then summing the differences between the elements at positions \(i\) and \(i+1\) for all \(i\) from 0 to \(n-2\).

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) - 1, 1):
            kq = kq + a[i + 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the given solution does not correctly maximize the beauty of the array. The provided solution only pairs the largest and smallest elements in pairs, which does not always yield the maximum beauty.

**Final: False**
