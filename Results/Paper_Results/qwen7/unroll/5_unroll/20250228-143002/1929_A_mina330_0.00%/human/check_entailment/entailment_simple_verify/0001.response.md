### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array \( n \) and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array \( a \).
   - It calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements in pairs.

3. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - Sorting the array ensures that the largest elements are paired with the smallest elements, maximizing the positive differences and minimizing the negative ones.
   - However, the current implementation only pairs the largest and smallest elements in pairs without considering the order of the remaining elements. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty for all possible permutations of the array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array has an even number of elements, the solution correctly pairs them.
   - If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element does not participate in the pairing, but this does not affect the maximization of the beauty since the middle element is either the largest or the smallest in the sorted array.
   - The solution does not consider other possible pairings that might yield a higher beauty.

5. **Verification**:
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement do not cover all possible scenarios. For instance, consider the array `[1, 100, 2, 99]`. Sorting it results in `[1, 2, 99, 100]`, and the current solution pairs `(100, 1)` and `(99, 2)`, resulting in a beauty of \(100 - 1 + 99 - 2 = 196\). However, another optimal pairing could be `(100, 2)` and `(99, 1)`, resulting in a beauty of \(100 - 2 + 99 - 1 = 196\), which is the same. But consider the array `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Sorting it results in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the current solution pairs `(4, 1)` and `(3, 2)`, resulting in a beauty of \(4 - 1 + 3 - 2 = 4\). However, another optimal pairing could be `(4, 2)` and `(3, 1)`, resulting in a beauty of \(4 - 2 + 3 - 1 = 4\), which is the same. 

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The current solution only considers one specific way of pairing the elements and does not explore all possible pairings. While it works for some cases, it may not always yield the maximum beauty for all possible permutations of the array.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not guarantee the maximum beauty of the array for all possible permutations of the array elements. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
