You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer array a of length n .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
take any element of the array a , which is at least 10 , delete it, and
instead insert the digits that element consisted of in the same position, in
order they appear in that element.

For example:

  * if we apply this operation to the 3 -rd element of the array [12, 3, 45, 67] , then the array becomes [12, 3, 4, 5, 67] . 
  * if we apply this operation to the 2 -nd element of the array [2, 10] , then the array becomes [2, 1, 0] . 

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted in non-
descending order using the aforementioned operation any number of times
(possibly zero). In other words, you have to determine if it is possible to
transform the array a in such a way that a_1 \le a_2 \le \dots \le a_k , where
k is the current length of the array a .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ). 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 99 ). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it is possible to make a sorted in non-
decreasing order using the aforementioned operation; otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as a positive answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    4
    
    12 3 45 67
    
    3
    
    12 28 5
    
    2
    
    0 0

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, you can split the first element, then the array becomes
[1, 2, 3, 45, 67] .

In the second example, there is no way to get a sorted array.

In the third example, the array is already sorted.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    for p in range(1, len(list1)):
        if not func_1(list1):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
    if func_1(list1):
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50.
def func_1(lst):
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    return lst == sorted_lst
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'lst' is sorted in ascending order or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) as input, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. After sorting the list in ascending order, it checks if the original list is equal to the sorted list. If the lists are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the original list was already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns `False`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the elements of the array starting from the second element (`p`).
   - It checks if the function `func_1` returns `False` (which means the array is not sorted).
   - If the previous element (`list1[p - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`list1[p]`) and the previous element is at least 10, it performs the operation to split the previous element into its digits and inserts them back into the array.

3. **Checking if the Array is Sorted:**
   - After potentially performing the operation, it checks if the array is sorted by calling `func_1(list1)`.
   - If the array is sorted, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function checks if the given list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it with its sorted version.
   - If the original list matches the sorted list, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Logic in Main Loop:**
   - The main loop should check if the array is already sorted before attempting to modify it. The current logic incorrectly assumes that the array needs modification even if it is already sorted.
   - The function `func_1` is called after every iteration of the main loop, which is unnecessary and inefficient.

2. **Splitting Operation Implementation:**
   - The splitting operation is implemented correctly but is only applied when the previous element is greater than the current element and the previous element is at least 10.
   - However, the logic to handle the splitting and insertion is not robust enough to ensure the array can be made sorted.

3. **Edge Cases Not Handled:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases such as arrays with leading zeros or arrays that cannot be sorted by the given operations.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Attempt to sort the array by splitting elements
    while True:
        sorted_list = sorted(list1)
        if list1 == sorted_list:
            print('Yes')
            break
        modified = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                a = list1[p - 1]
                list1.pop(p - 1)
                list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)
                list1.insert(p, a % 10)
                modified = True
                break
        if not modified:
            print('No')
            break
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical issues and inefficiencies. The corrected program ensures that the array is checked for being sorted before attempting modifications and handles the splitting operation correctly.
