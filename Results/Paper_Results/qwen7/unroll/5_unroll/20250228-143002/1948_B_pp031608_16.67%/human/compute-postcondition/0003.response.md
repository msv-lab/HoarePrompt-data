Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) as input, where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. After sorting the list in ascending order, it checks if the original list is equal to the sorted list. If the lists are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the original list was already sorted in ascending order; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
