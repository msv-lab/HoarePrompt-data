Reasoning:

1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Specifically, the logic inside the `for` loop that attempts to sort the array using the defined operation is flawed.

2. The main issue is with the line `if not func_1(list1):`. This line checks if the list is already sorted, but it should only be used as a final check after all operations are attempted.

3. The logic inside the `for` loop incorrectly modifies the list without considering the full problem constraints. It only checks if the previous element is greater than the current element and greater than 10, and then splits the element, which is not sufficient to ensure the array can be sorted.

4. The function `func_1` simply checks if the list is sorted, which is not the correct approach for solving the problem. The function should simulate the operations and check if the array can be sorted through these operations.

5. The program does not handle cases where the array cannot be sorted even if it starts with elements greater than 10. For example, the array `[12, 28, 5]` cannot be sorted using the given operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
