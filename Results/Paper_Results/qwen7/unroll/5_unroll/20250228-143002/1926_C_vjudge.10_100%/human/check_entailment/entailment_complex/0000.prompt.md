Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

# Annotated Program:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0
        
        for x in str(i):
            sum_value_digits += int(x)
        
        values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, `t` is an input integer, and for each iteration, `value` is set to an integer read from input and then the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` list is printed. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`. The function initializes a list `values` to store these cumulative sums up to 200,000. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the required cumulative sums for each test case.
