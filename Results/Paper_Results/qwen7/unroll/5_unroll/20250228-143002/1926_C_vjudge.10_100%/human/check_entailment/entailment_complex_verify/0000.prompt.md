You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Please note that the time limit for this problem is only 0.5 seconds per test.

Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n , inclusive, on the board. Then he
replaced each integer with the sum of its digits.

What is the sum of the numbers on the board now?

For example, if n=12 then initially the numbers on the board are:

Then after the replacement, the numbers become:

The sum of these numbers is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51 . Thus, for n=12 the
answer is 51 .

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the largest number Vladislav writes.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers at the
end of the process.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func_1():
    inf = 2 * 10 ** 5 + 1
    t = int(input())
    values = [0] * inf
    for i in range(1, inf):
        sum_value_digits = 0

    #State: Output State: `t` is an input integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001, `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`.
    for _ in range(t):
        value = int(input())
        
        print(values[value])
        
    #State: Output State: `values` is a list where each index `i` (from 1 to 200000) contains the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `i`, `t` is an input integer, and for each iteration, `value` is set to an integer read from input and then the corresponding cumulative sum from the `values` list is printed. The variable `n` remains unchanged and is not affected by the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and prints the cumulative sum of the digit sums from 1 to `n`. The function initializes a list `values` to store these cumulative sums up to 200,000. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the required cumulative sums for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to precompute the sum of the digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) and store them in an array `values`. However, this approach is inefficient and unnecessary for solving the problem as described.

The problem requires calculating the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case. The given implementation uses a large fixed-size array `values` which is not needed and can lead to issues with large inputs. Instead, the program should directly compute the sum of digit sums for the range from 1 to \(n\) for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def sum_of_digit_sums(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum_value_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
        total_sum += sum_value_digits
    return total_sum

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(sum_of_digit_sums(n))
```

This corrected program directly computes the sum of the digit sums for the range from 1 to \(n\) without using any precomputed values, making it more efficient and correct according to the problem description.
