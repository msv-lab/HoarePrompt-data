Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable mentioned here is `_`, but it is typically used as a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop's execution directly. The key variable that controls the loop's execution is `t`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider other states**: The other variables mentioned in the state before the loop (`n`, `inf`, and `values`) are not part of the loop head and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this reasoning, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
