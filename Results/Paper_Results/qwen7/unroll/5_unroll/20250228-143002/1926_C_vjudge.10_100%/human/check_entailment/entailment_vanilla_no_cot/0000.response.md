Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as intended. The approach used in `func_1` precomputes the sum of digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \cdot 10^5\) and stores them in the `values` array. While this approach works for the specific problem, it is not efficient in terms of space complexity due to the large array size. 

However, the main issue is that the problem requires processing multiple test cases, but the code only handles one test case at a time without resetting the state between test cases. Additionally, the input handling and output formatting need to be adjusted to match the problem statement requirements.

A more efficient and correct approach would be to directly compute the sum of digit sums for each number within the range specified for each test case without precomputing all values. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            sum_value_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            total_sum += sum_value_digits
        
        print(total_sum)

func_1()
```

This version reads all inputs at once, processes each test case individually, and computes the required sum of digit sums directly for the range specified in each test case.
