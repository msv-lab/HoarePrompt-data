Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes two integers: `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5. The function does not return any value directly but implies processing or validating these integers within its body.**

Note: The actual return value or output is not specified in the given information, so the focus is on the parameters and their constraints.
