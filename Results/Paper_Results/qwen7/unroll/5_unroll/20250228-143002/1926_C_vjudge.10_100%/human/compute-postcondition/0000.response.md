Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001**.

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `inf` with the value `2 * 10 ** 5 + 1`, which evaluates to 200001. This assignment does not affect the values of `t` or `n`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `n`, while introducing the new variable `inf` with its specific value.
