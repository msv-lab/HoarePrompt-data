Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a string of length \( n \) made up of '.', '@', or '*'. It counts the number of times the character '@' appears before encountering two consecutive '*' characters in each string. If two consecutive '*' characters are found, the counting stops early. The function outputs the count for each test case.**
