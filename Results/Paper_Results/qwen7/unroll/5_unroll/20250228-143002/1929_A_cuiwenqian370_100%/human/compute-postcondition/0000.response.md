Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 representing the length of the array; `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]; `results` is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of the existing variables but instead reassigns the `input` identifier to refer to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This means that the `input` function is now being pointed to `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `array`, and `results`) remain unchanged.
