Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

### Provided Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. Sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is calculated as:
\[ |54 - 43| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \]

But the optimal arrangement could be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]` which would give:
\[ |90 - 100| + |80 - 90| + |54 - 80| + |43 - 54| = 10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57 \]

So, sorting is not the best approach here.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The main issue here is that `func_1` is not designed to find the optimal arrangement of the array to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply calculates the beauty of the sorted array, which is not always the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it only considers the beauty of the sorted array, which is not guaranteed to be the maximum possible beauty. The correct solution would involve finding the optimal arrangement of the array elements to maximize the sum of differences.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
