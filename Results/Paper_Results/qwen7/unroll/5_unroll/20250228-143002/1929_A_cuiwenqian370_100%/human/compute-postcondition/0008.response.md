Output State: **index is t * (n + 1), results is a list containing the printed results of func_1 for each test case based on the arrays provided in the input data.**

Explanation: The loop simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element. Since printing does not modify the elements of the list or the value of `index`, the `index` remains unchanged at `t * (n + 1)`. Each element in the `results` list is printed but the list itself remains the same.
