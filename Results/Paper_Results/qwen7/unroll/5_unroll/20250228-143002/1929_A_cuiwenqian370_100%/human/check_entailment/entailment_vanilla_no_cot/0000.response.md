Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` calculates the beauty of the array as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, but it does not account for the fact that the array can be rearranged to maximize the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array in ascending order and then pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(len(array) // 2):
        beauty += array[-(i + 1)] - array[i]
    if len(array) % 2 != 0:
        beauty += array[-(len(array) // 2 + 1)]
    return beauty

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version of `func_1` properly rearranges the array to maximize the beauty, ensuring that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.
