Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 representing the length of the array; array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]; results is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case.** 

Note: The function `func_1` is assumed to be defined elsewhere and is responsible for calculating the maximum beauty of the array. The precondition for `func_1` would involve the array passed to it, but since the function signature is not provided, we only describe the preconditions relevant to the variables in the given function.
