You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). To maximize this, we should aim to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

### Provided Code Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
```python
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty
```

This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements. However, sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. Sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, and the beauty is calculated as:
\[ |54 - 43| + |80 - 54| + |90 - 80| + |100 - 90| = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \]

But the optimal arrangement could be `[100, 90, 80, 54, 43]` which would give:
\[ |90 - 100| + |80 - 90| + |54 - 80| + |43 - 54| = 10 + 10 + 26 + 11 = 57 \]

So, sorting is not the best approach here.

#### Function `func_2`
```python
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The main issue here is that `func_1` is not designed to find the optimal arrangement of the array to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply calculates the beauty of the sorted array, which is not always the maximum possible beauty.

### Conclusion
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem because it only considers the beauty of the sorted array, which is not guaranteed to be the maximum possible beauty. The correct solution would involve finding the optimal arrangement of the array elements to maximize the sum of differences.

### Correctness
Correctness: **False**
