You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers where 2 <= len(array) <= 100 and 1 <= array[i] <= 10^9 for all valid i.
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements in the `array`.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements in the array.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, sorts the list, calculates the sum of absolute differences between every pair of adjacent elements, and returns this sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 representing the length of the array; array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]; results is a list to store the maximum beauty for each test case.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []

        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: index is t * (n + 1), t is the number of test cases, results is a list containing the result of func_1 for each test case based on the arrays provided in the input data.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: index is t * (n + 1), results is a list containing the printed results of func_1 for each test case based on the arrays provided in the input data.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, calculating the maximum beauty for each case based on an array of integers provided in the input data. It stores the results in a list and prints the result for each test case.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the `func_1` function calculates the beauty of the array as the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements, but this approach does not guarantee the maximum possible beauty after rearranging the elements.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
100 54 80 43 90
```
The provided solution sorts the array and calculates the beauty as:
```
|54 - 100| + |80 - 54| + |43 - 80| + |90 - 43| = 46 + 26 + 37 + 47 = 156
```
However, the maximum beauty can be achieved by rearranging the elements to maximize the positive differences. One optimal arrangement could be `[43, 90, 100, 80, 54]`, which gives:
```
|90 - 43| + |100 - 90| + |80 - 100| + |54 - 80| = 47 + 10 + 20 + 26 = 103
```
Thus, the program does not always find the maximum possible beauty, making it incorrect.
