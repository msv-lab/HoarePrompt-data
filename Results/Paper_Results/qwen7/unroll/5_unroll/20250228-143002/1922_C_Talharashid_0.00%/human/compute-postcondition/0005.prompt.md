You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5, and for each query, x_i and y_i are integers such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i.

    #State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing an integer result from the given code snippet. For each iteration `i` (where `0 <= i < t`), the result is calculated based on the input list `lst` and the number of queries `m`. The result for each query is the minimum value of `s1` and `s2`, where `s1` is the sum of differences calculated from the left side of the list and `s2` is the sum of differences calculated from the right side of the list, for the specified subarray defined by `start` and `end`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), for each test case, an integer n (such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, an integer m (such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and for each query, two integers x_i and y_i (such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i). The function returns results based on the queries provided.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
