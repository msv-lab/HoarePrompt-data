Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including an integer t (such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), for each test case, an integer n (such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list of n integers a where 0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9, an integer m (such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5), and for each query, two integers x_i and y_i (such that 1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n and x_i ≠ y_i). The function returns results based on the queries provided.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each with its own set of integers and queries. It processes these inputs and returns outputs based on the specified queries.
