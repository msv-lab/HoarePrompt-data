Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \) and \( k \), and the array \( a \) of length \( 2n \).
3. It initializes arrays \( l \) and \( r \) to store the selected elements.
4. It counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of the array \( a \) and the second half separately.
5. It attempts to form the arrays \( l \) and \( r \) such that their XOR values are equal, using the counts of occurrences.
6. The logic for forming \( l \) and \( r \) seems to handle the constraints correctly:
   - It first tries to use pairs of elements from the first half of \( a \) (where each element appears exactly twice).
   - If not enough pairs are available, it uses single occurrences from the first half to complete the required count.
   - Finally, it ensures the XOR condition is met by possibly using elements from the second half of \( a \).

Given the problem statement and the provided logic, the program should work correctly under the given constraints. The program handles the formation of \( l \) and \( r \) arrays according to the problem requirements and ensures the XOR condition is met.

Correctness: **True**
