Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`. 

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop condition directly.
   - The expression `int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to a variable (let's call this variable `num_cases`). This variable determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `num_cases` is greater than 0. Therefore, the loop will execute at least once if `num_cases` is 1 or more.

4. **Adjust the initial state**: Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), and considering that `t` represents the number of test cases, we need to ensure that `num_cases` (the value read from `input()`) is at least 1. Since `t` is given as a positive integer, we can assume that `num_cases` will be set to `t`.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should include the fact that `num_cases` must be at least 1, and `t` is within its given range.

**Final State**:
State: **`num_cases` must be at least 1, and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000**
