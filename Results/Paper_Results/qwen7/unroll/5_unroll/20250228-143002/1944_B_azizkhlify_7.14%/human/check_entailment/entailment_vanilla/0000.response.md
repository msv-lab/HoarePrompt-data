Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the array `a`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Arrays `l` and `r` are initialized with zeros.
   - Variables `re`, `ul`, and `ur` are initialized to zero.
   - An empty list `res` is created to store elements for the second part of the solution.

3. **Counting Elements in `l` and `r`**:
   - The program counts the occurrences of each element in the first half of the array (`l`) and the second half of the array (`r`).

4. **Constructing `l`**:
   - The program attempts to construct `l` by selecting pairs of elements from the first half of `a` that occur exactly twice. This is done using the condition `if l[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
   - If `ul` (the number of elements added to `l`) reaches `k * 2`, the loop breaks.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements for `l`**:
   - After constructing as many pairs as possible, the program tries to add single elements from the first half of `a` to `l` until `ul` reaches `k * 2`.

6. **Printing `l`**:
   - The program prints the constructed `l` and stores the remaining elements in `res`.

7. **Constructing `r`**:
   - The program constructs `r` by selecting pairs of elements from the second half of `a` that occur exactly twice. This is done using the condition `if r[a[i] - 1] == 2`.
   - If `ul` equals `ur` (the number of elements added to `r`), the loop breaks.

8. **Printing `r`**:
   - The program prints the constructed `r`.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Construction of `l` and `r`**:
   - The program assumes that the first half of `a` will always have enough pairs to form `l` and the second half will always have enough pairs to form `r`. However, this is not guaranteed. The program should ensure that the XOR values match after constructing `l` and `r`.

2. **Handling Single Elements**:
   - The program incorrectly handles single elements. It should ensure that the XOR of `l` matches the XOR of `r` after adding single elements.

3. **XOR Calculation**:
   - The program does not explicitly calculate the XOR of `l` and `r` to verify if they match. This is crucial to ensure the solution is correct.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
