Output State: **max_val is 1.**

Explanation: The given loop iterates over possible divisors of `x` in descending order from `x-1` to `2`. If a divisor `y` satisfies `2 * y >= x`, it returns `y`. Otherwise, it updates `max_val` to `y`. Since the initial value of `max_val` is 1 and the loop does not provide any mechanism to change this value unless a condition is met (which is not guaranteed for any arbitrary `x`), the final value of `max_val` remains 1.
