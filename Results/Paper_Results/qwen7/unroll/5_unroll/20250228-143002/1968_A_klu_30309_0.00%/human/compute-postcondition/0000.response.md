Output State: **The function to find the optimal y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y is defined but no value for x is provided, therefore, x is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**

Explanation: The code defines a function that aims to find the value of `y` that maximizes the expression `gcd(x, y) + y`. However, the function body is not provided, so no variables are actually updated or assigned new values. The initial state of `x` being an integer between 2 and 1000 remains unchanged.
