Output State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007**

The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the values of `YES` and `NO`, which remain as their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `MOD` and retains the initial states of `YES` and `NO`.
