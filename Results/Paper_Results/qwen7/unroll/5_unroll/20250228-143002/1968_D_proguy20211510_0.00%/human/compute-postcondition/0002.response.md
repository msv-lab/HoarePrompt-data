Output State: **`YES` is 'YES', `NO` is 'NO', `MOD` is 1000000007, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**

The code initializes the variable `alpha` with the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. This assignment does not affect the values of `YES`, `NO`, or `MOD`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
