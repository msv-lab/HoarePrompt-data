Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position for the road is exactly at `mid`. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the scenario where the optimal position is exactly at the midpoint, causing it to choose the wrong side in such cases. For example, consider the input:

```
3
101
```

The program should output `2`, but it incorrectly outputs `1` because it does not correctly handle the case where the optimal position is exactly at the midpoint. This can be seen from the logic in the program where it checks if `left == 0` or `right == n` without considering the exact midpoint case.
