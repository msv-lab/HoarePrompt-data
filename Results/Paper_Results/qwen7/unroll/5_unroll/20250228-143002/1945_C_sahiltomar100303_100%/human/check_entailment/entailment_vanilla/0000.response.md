### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates through each test case, reading the number of houses `n` and the binary string `s`.

2. **Midpoint Calculation:**
   - The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`, which is a good starting point for checking the balance of houses on both sides.

3. **Initial Counting:**
   - The initial counts of zeros and ones on both sides are calculated correctly using two loops. This ensures that the counts are updated as the midpoint is moved.

4. **Left Side Adjustment:**
   - The loop to adjust the left side (`while left > 0`) correctly updates the counts of zeros and ones as the midpoint is moved towards the left. This ensures that the counts are updated dynamically as the midpoint changes.

5. **Right Side Adjustment:**
   - Similarly, the loop to adjust the right side (`while right < n`) correctly updates the counts of zeros and ones as the midpoint is moved towards the right.

6. **Final Decision:**
   - The final decision-making logic checks whether the current position is optimal by comparing the distances from the center. If the current position is closer to the center or equal but smaller, it is chosen.

7. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles edge cases such as when the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house. It also ensures that the correct position is printed when there are multiple optimal positions.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the code, it appears that the logic is sound and correctly implements the requirements of the problem. The code handles all necessary conditions and edge cases appropriately.

### Correctness:
**True**
