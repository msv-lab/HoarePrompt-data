Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program does not check if the chosen sticks can form a triangle (i.e., if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick). Instead, it simply counts the combinations of sticks regardless of whether they can form a triangle.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 2
```

The program will output `4`, but the correct output should be `4` because there are 4 ways to choose 3 sticks of length 2 (since any combination of 3 sticks of the same length can form a degenerate triangle, which does not meet the requirement of being non-degenerate). However, the program does not handle the condition for forming a non-degenerate triangle, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that the chosen sticks can form a non-degenerate triangle.
