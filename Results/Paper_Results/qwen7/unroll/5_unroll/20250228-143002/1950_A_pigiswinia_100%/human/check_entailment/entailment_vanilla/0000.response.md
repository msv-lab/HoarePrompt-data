### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs**: For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The program checks if `a < b < c` and prints "STAIR" if this condition is met.
   - It then checks if `a < b > c` and prints "PEAK" if this condition is met.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where the digits do not form either a stair or a peak correctly by printing "NONE".
   - It also handles the case where the same digit is repeated (e.g., `0 0 0`) correctly by printing "NONE".

Given that the program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem statement and handles all possible cases as described, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
