Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE', based on the comparison of integers `a`, `b`, and `c` provided by the user for each iteration of the loop. The value of `t` is determined by the initial integer input, and for each line, the output depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` entered during that iteration.
