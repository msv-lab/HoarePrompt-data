Reasoning:
1. The function correctly processes multiple test cases.
2. It constructs a template string based on the comparison between `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template uses the character from `a` (or `b`). If they are different, the template uses the uppercase version of the character from `a`.
3. It then checks if both `a` and `b` match this template:
   - For lowercase letters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are exactly the same as the template.
   - For uppercase letters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding characters in `a` and `b` are different from the lowercase version of the template.
4. It also checks if `c` does not match the template:
   - For lowercase letters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is different from the template.
   - For uppercase letters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` is the lowercase version of the template.
5. The function correctly prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the above points, the function appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
