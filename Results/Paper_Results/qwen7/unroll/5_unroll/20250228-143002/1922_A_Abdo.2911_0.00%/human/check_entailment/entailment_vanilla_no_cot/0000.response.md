Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a template `t` such that the strings `a` and `b` match it, while the string `c` does not. Let's break down the correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.

2. **Template Construction**: For each character in the strings `a` and `b`, if they are the same, the template takes that character; otherwise, it takes the uppercase version of `a[i]`. This ensures that both `a` and `b` can match the template.

3. **Validation**:
   - It checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
   - It also checks if `c` does not match the template.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The logic in the program accurately follows the problem statement and handles all given examples correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
