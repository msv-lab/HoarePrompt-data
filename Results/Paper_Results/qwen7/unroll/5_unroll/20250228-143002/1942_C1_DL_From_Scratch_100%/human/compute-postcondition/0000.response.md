Output State: **`T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, indicating the number of test cases. Each test case will consist of integers `n`, `x`, and `y` with the given constraints, and a list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**

This means that the variable `T` now holds the number of test cases, and for each test case, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` will be read from input, along with a list of `x` distinct integers. The initial value of `t` is no longer relevant, and the constraints for `n`, `x`, and `y` are maintained.
