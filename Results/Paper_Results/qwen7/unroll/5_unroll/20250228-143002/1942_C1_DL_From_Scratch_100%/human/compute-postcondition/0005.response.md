Functionality: **The function processes up to 10,000 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( x \), and \( y \), and a list of \( x \) distinct integers from 1 to \( n \). It then calculates the number of gaps of size 1 between consecutive elements in the sorted list of integers and adds \( x - 2 \) to this count. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.**
