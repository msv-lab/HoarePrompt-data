Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the chosen vertices can form triangles directly without needing additional vertices. The program only checks the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices and does not consider the possibility of forming triangles using the chosen vertices themselves.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
8 4 0
1 6 2 5
```
The program outputs `2`, but the correct answer should be `3`. Here's why:
- The chosen vertices are 1, 2, 5, and 6.
- We can form triangles with these vertices directly:
  - Triangle with vertices 1, 2, 5
  - Triangle with vertices 1, 2, 6
  - Triangle with vertices 5, 6, 2

The program only counts the gaps between the vertices, which misses the direct triangles formed by the chosen vertices. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
