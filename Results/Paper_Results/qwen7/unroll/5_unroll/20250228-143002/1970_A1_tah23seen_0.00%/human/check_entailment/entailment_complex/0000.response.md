Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and passes it to the function `func_1`.
2. The function `func_1` initializes an empty string `ans` and a dictionary `d` to store the balance of parentheses up to each index.
3. It iterates through the string `s` and updates the dictionary `d` to reflect the balance at each index.
4. The dictionary `d` is then sorted based on the balance values, breaking ties by position in descending order.
5. A new string `ans` is constructed by concatenating characters from `s` using the sorted indices from `d`.
6. The function returns the string `ans`.

Given the problem description and the steps taken in the function, the program appears to correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. The sorting step ensures that the resulting string maintains the required properties of a balanced shuffle.

Correctness: **True**
