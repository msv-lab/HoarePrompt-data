#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list where each element represents the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a string consisting of all characters from `s` in the order specified by the indices in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters from `s` in the order specified by the indices in `d`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of characters "(" and ")`, ensuring it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It constructs a dictionary `d` to track the balance of parentheses up to each index in `s`. After processing, it sorts the dictionary items based on their balance values and constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating characters from `s` according to the sorted indices. Finally, it returns the string `ans` containing characters from `s` in the order specified by the sorted indices.
