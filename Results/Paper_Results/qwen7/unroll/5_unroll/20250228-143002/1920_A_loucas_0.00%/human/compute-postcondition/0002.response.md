Output State: The output state depends on the specific input values for each test case, including the value of `loop` and the constraints provided. The final output will be the smallest integer `i` that is greater than all elements in `big` and less than all elements in `less`, excluding any elements in `no`. If no such integer exists, the output will be undefined for that particular test case.
