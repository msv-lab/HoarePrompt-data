Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in `b` is mapped to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of characters in `b`. Specifically, the character with the highest frequency or the last character in the sorted set of `b` will be mapped to 'z', the next one to 'y', and so on until the first character in the sorted set of `b` is mapped to 'a'.
