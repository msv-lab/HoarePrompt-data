Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the encoded string `b` and the string `b` itself.
3. The function `func_1` is responsible for decoding the string `b`:
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` to map each unique character in the sorted set of `b` to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the position of the character in the sorted set.
   - This mapping is done by iterating over the sorted unique characters of `b` and assigning them corresponding characters from 'z' to 'a'.
   - Then, it constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.
4. The function returns the decoded string `s`.

Given the problem description and the provided states, the logic in the function `func_1` accurately reverses the encoding process described. The steps taken to create the `char_map` and decode the string `b` are consistent with the encoding process described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
