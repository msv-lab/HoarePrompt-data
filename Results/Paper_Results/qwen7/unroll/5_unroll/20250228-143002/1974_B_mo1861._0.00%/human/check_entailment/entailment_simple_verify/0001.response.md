### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires decoding an encoded string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` in sorted order and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding character from the end of `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` should reverse the encoding process.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in `b` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of `r`.
   - For each character in `b`, it uses this map to find the original character in `s`.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly sorts the unique characters of `b` and maps each character to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list.
   - The mapping logic is correct because it uses the index of the character in the sorted list to determine its position from the end.
   - The decoding process iterates through each character in `b` and uses the `char_map` to construct the original string `s`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles strings of varying lengths and compositions correctly.
   - The use of `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` ensures that the mapping is done correctly, considering the zero-based index.

5. **Output Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement match the expected outputs when decoded using the given function.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the `char_map` creation. The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the mapping is done correctly by mapping each character in `b` to its corresponding character from the end of the sorted list. This is not the correct approach for decoding the string.

In the encoding process, each character in `s` is replaced by its symmetric character from the string `r`. Therefore, to decode, we need to map each character in `b` to its corresponding character in `r` from the start, not from the end.

### Corrected Implementation:
To correctly decode the string, we should create the `char_map` such that each character in `r` (sorted unique characters of `s`) is mapped to its corresponding character in `b` from the start. Here is the corrected implementation:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    for (i, c) in enumerate(r):
        char_map[c] = b[i]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Final Evaluation:
- The original assessment incorrectly assumed that the mapping was done from the end of the sorted list, which is not correct for decoding.
- The corrected implementation ensures that each character in `b` is mapped to its corresponding character in `r` from the start, which is the correct approach for decoding.

Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate.

**Final: False**
