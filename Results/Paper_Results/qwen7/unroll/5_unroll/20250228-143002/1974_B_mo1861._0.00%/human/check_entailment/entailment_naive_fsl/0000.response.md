Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string. Specifically, the issue lies in the `char_map` construction. The program incorrectly maps each character in the sorted set of the encoded string `b` to its symmetric character. The mapping should be based on the position of each character in the sorted set, but the current implementation uses the length of the encoded string `b` to determine the symmetric position, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "serofedsoc"`. The sorted unique characters in `b` are `cdefors`, and their symmetric positions should be:

- 'c' -> 's'
- 'd' -> 'r'
- 'e' -> 'e'
- 'f' -> 'd'
- 'o' -> 'o'
- 'r' -> 'c'

However, the current implementation incorrectly maps these characters. For instance, the character 'c' in the sorted set is mapped to the character at position `len(b) - 1 - 0` (which is 9), resulting in 's'. This is incorrect because 'c' should map to 's', not 's'.

To fix this, the mapping should be constructed based on the index of each character in the sorted set, not the length of the encoded string. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    sorted_unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for i, c in enumerate(sorted_unique_chars):
        char_map[c] = sorted_unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

This corrected function will properly decode the encoded string according to the problem description.
