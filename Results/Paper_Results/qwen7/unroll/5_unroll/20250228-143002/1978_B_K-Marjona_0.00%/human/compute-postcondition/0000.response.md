Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used to determine the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` is the number of test cases.

3. **Adjust the State for the Loop to Execute**: For the loop to execute, the input value (which determines the number of iterations) must be a positive integer within the specified range. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that the input value is valid for the loop to proceed.

Given this, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, which should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute as expected, with `t` representing the number of test cases.
