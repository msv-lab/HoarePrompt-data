Output State: The output state consists of a series of values printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( b \leq a \), the output is \( a \times n \). Otherwise, the output is \(\frac{(b + (b - k + 1))}{2} \times k + (n - k) \times a\), where \( k = \min(n, b - a) \).

This means for each test case, the output will either be a simple multiplication of \( a \) and \( n \) if \( b \) is less than or equal to \( a \), or a more complex calculation involving \( a \), \( b \), and \( n \) if \( b \) is greater than \( a \).
