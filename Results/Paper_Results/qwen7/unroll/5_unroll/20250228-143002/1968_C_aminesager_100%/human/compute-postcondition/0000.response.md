Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and it is the input integer from the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` retains this property and is now the specific integer input by the user. The values of `n` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not involved in this particular code snippet.
