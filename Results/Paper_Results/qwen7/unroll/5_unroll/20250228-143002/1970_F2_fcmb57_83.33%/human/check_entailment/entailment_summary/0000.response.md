Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to simulate a Quidditch game according to the problem statement.
2. The program correctly initializes the field, players, goals, and the Quaffle.
3. The program processes each move step-by-step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
4. The program handles player eliminations, scoring, and updates the final score correctly.
5. The function `func_1` is used to update the position of players based on their movement commands, and it seems to work as intended without using the first parameter `a`.
6. The program prints the appropriate events in the correct order and format.
7. The final score is printed correctly at the end of the game.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the logic and requirements specified in the problem statement accurately.

Correctness: **True**
