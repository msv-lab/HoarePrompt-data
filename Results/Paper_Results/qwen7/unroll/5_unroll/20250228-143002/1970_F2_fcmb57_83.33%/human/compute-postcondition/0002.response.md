Output State: **The program returns x + b[0] and y + b[1]**.

This means that the program returns two values: the first is the value of `x` (which is also the value of `a`) plus the first element of list `b` (`dx`), and the second is the value of `y` (which is also part of `a`) plus the second element of list `b` (`dy`).
