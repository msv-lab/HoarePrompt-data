Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
1. **Function `func_1` is not used correctly**: The function `func_1` is defined but not called correctly in the main loop. The line `players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])` should call `func_1` with the correct arguments. However, the function is not called, leading to incorrect player movements.

2. **Bludger Handling**: The logic for handling the Bludger is incomplete. When a Bludger hits a player, the player should be eliminated, but the code does not handle this scenario properly. Specifically, the code should check if a player is on the same cell as a Bludger and eliminate the player accordingly.

3. **Quaffle Movement and Scoring**: The logic for scoring when the Quaffle is thrown into a goal is almost correct but needs to ensure that the Quaffle returns to the middle of the field correctly. The line `if quidditch[1] == k:` should be checking if the player is carrying the Quaffle (`quidditch[1] == k`) before eliminating the player.

4. **Elimination Logic**: The elimination logic for players is not fully implemented. When a player is eliminated, the player should be removed from the `players` dictionary, and the Quaffle should be placed back in the middle of the field.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
(n, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
players = dict()
goals = {'B': [], 'R': []}
mouvements = {'L': (-1, 0), 'R': (1, 0), 'U': (0, -1), 'D': (0, 1)}
middle = ((m + 1) // 2, (n + 1) // 2)
quidditch = [middle, '']
(pointsb, pointsr) = (0, 0)
for y in range(n):
    s = input().split()
    for x in range(m):
        if s[x] == '..':
            continue
        elif s[x] == '.Q':
            quidditch[0] = (x, y)
        elif s[x] == 'RG':
            goals['R'].append((x, y))
        elif s[x] == 'BG':
            goals['B'].append((x, y))
        else:
            players[s[x]] = (x, y)
moves = int(input())
for i in range(moves):
    mo = input().split()
    if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
        (x, y) = players[mo[0]]
        (dx, dy) = mouvements[mo[1]]
        new_x, new_y = x + dx, y + dy
        if 0 <= new_x < m and 0 <= new_y < n:
            players[mo[0]] = (new_x, new_y)
            if '.B' in players:
                for (k, v) in players.items():
                    if k != '.B' and v == players['.B']:
                        print(i, k, 'ELIMINATED')
                        if quidditch[1] == k:
                            quidditch = [v, '']
                        del players[k]
    elif mo[1] == 'C':
        quidditch[1] = mo[0]
    elif mo[1] == 'T':
        if quidditch[1] in players:
            if players[quidditch[1]] in goals['R']:
                pointsb += 1
                print(i, 'BLUE GOAL')
                quidditch = [middle, '']
            if players[quidditch[1]] in goals['B']:
                pointsr += 1
                print(i, 'RED GOAL')
                quidditch = [middle, '']
        quidditch[1] = ''
print('FINAL SCORE:', pointsr, pointsb)
```

This corrected version ensures that the player movements, eliminations, and scoring are handled correctly.
