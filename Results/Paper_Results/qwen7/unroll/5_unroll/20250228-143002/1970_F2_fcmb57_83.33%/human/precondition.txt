N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters. The field contains goals for two teams, players for both teams, exactly one Quaffle, and optionally one Bludger. The number of players per team P satisfies 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. The number of steps T satisfies 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.
