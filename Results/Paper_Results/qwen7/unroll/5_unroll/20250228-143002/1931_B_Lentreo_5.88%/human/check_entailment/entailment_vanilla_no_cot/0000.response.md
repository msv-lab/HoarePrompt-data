Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the sum of differences between each element and the last element is zero, which is not a valid approach to solve the problem.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among all containers. This can be done by checking if the average amount of water per container (total water divided by the number of containers) is an integer. If it is, then it is possible to distribute the water equally among all containers.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if the average water per container is an integer
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

This corrected program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it can be evenly distributed among the containers. If the total water is divisible by the number of containers, it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
