Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers is zero. However, this approach is flawed. The correct solution should check if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water between containers, which is equivalent to checking if the total amount of water divided by the number of containers (n) is an integer and remains consistent throughout the operations.

Here's why the given program is incorrect:
- The program calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers but does not correctly reflect the redistribution of water.
- The logic for determining if it's possible to equalize the water in all containers is flawed because it doesn't account for the redistribution process.

The correct approach would be to verify if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (n), ensuring that each container can potentially end up with the same amount of water.

Correctness: **False**
