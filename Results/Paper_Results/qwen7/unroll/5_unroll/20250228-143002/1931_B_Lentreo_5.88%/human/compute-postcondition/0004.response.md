Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data through standard input. It reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and then reads `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function ensures the sum of `a_i` in each test case does not exceed 2⋅10^9 and is divisible by `n`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the result for each case.**

This functionality describes a function that takes no direct parameters but handles multiple test cases via standard input, where each test case involves reading an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_i`, ensuring certain conditions are met, and then performing some unspecified operation or calculation based on this input.
