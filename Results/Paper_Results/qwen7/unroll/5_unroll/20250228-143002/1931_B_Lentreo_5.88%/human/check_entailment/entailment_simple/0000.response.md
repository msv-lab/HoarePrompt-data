### Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero elements in the list is zero. This approach is flawed because it does not correctly address the problem's requirements.

Here's the correct approach to solving the problem:
- The key observation is that since the total amount of water is divisible by \( n \), if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same, that amount must be the average of the total water divided by \( n \).
- To achieve this, we need to check if the sum of water in all containers is evenly distributed among the \( n \) containers. This means that the sum of water in all containers should be divisible by \( n \), and each container should end up with the same amount of water, which is the total sum divided by \( n \).

However, the current implementation does not correctly check these conditions. Instead, it checks the cumulative sum of differences between consecutive non-zero elements, which is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Implementation:
A correct solution would involve:
1. Calculating the total sum of water in all containers.
2. Checking if the total sum is divisible by \( n \).
3. If it is, then it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, which is the total sum divided by \( n \).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        
        # Check if the total water is divisible by n
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed logic in the original program, the provided solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
