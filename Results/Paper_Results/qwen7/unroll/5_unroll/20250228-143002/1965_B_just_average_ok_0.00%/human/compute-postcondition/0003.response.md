Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000), and for each t, two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^6, 1 <= k <= n) are processed. The function returns a result based on the conditions given for n and k, without explicitly showing how the function operates internally.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing values for t, n, and k, and returns results based on the specified constraints and relationships between these parameters.
