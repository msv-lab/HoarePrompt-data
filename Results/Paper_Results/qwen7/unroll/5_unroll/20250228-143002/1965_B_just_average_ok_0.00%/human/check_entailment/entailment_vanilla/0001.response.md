Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program initializes a list `nums` with powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\) (since \(2^{24} > 10^9\)).
   - It finds the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes it from the list.
   - It appends `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` to the list, where `idx` is the index of the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.
   - Finally, it removes the largest power of 2 from the list.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the modified list `nums`.
   - It then prints the elements of the list `nums`.

### Verification Against Problem Constraints and Requirements:

1. **Sequence Size:**
   - The sequence `nums` is constructed to have at most 25 elements, which satisfies the constraint \(1 \le m \le 25\).

2. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By removing the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and ensuring that `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1` are included, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because any subsequence that includes `k - nums[idx]` will include a power of 2 that makes the sum exactly `k`.

3. **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values:**
   - The remaining elements in `nums` cover a wide range of values, ensuring that every value from 1 to `n` except `k` can be formed as a subsequence sum. This is due to the inclusion of powers of 2 and the additional elements added to ensure coverage.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases well, such as when `k` itself is a power of 2, by ensuring that the necessary adjustments are made to avoid including `k` in any subsequence sum.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly generates a sequence that meets all the specified conditions of the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
