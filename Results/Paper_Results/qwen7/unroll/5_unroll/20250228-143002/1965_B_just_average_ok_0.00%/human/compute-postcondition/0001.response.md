Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, and for each test case, n and k are integers satisfying 2 <= n <= 10^6 and 1 <= k <= n. Additionally, the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^7. After executing the loop, the length of `nums` is 4 and `nums` contains the elements [k - (1 << idx), k + 1, k + (1 << idx) + 1], where `idx` is the highest index such that \(1 << idx \leq k\).
