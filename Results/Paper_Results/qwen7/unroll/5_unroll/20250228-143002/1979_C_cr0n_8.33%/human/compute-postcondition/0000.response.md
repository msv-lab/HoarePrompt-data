Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N is an input integer such that 1 ≤ N ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `N = int(input().strip())` reads an input from the user, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and converts it to an integer. This integer is assigned to the variable `N`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet.
