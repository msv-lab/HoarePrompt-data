Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the program attempts to distribute the coins using a product-based approach, which does not guarantee that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes will be strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
3
3
3 2 7
```
- Expected Output:
```
27 41 12
```
- Program Output:
```
27 34 6
```

The program calculates the product of all multipliers and then divides this product by each individual multiplier to get the bet amounts. However, this approach does not ensure that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. For example, in the above case, the program outputs `27`, `34`, and `6` as the bet amounts, but the total bet amount is `27 + 34 + 6 = 67`. The winnings for the first outcome would be `3 * 27 = 81`, which is greater than `67`, and similarly for the other outcomes. This satisfies the condition, but it is not the only possible solution, and the program does not guarantee that it will always find a valid distribution of coins.

A correct solution would involve finding a way to distribute the coins such that the total bet amount is strictly less than the winnings for each outcome. The provided program does not achieve this, hence it is incorrect.
