Reasoning:

1. The given program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements.
2. The main issues are:
   - The `func_1` function processes each test case but does not check if the resulting array is sorted after performing the operations.
   - The variable `b` is used to store results, but it is not initialized before use.
   - The logic inside `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly simulate the described operation.
   - The program does not read the actual array elements properly.
   - The program does not handle the operations of splitting numbers into their digits and inserting them back into the array.
   - The program does not check if the array can be made sorted after performing the operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
