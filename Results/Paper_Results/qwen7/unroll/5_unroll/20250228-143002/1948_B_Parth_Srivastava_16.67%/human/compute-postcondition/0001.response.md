Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, k is an input integer, a is an input string**

Explanation: The variable `a` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user, which is treated as a string since no conversion to an integer or any other type is specified. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.
