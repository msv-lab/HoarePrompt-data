Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two integers n and k within each test case where 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts `n` and `k` through a test case structure, where `n` and `k` are integers with specific constraints, and returns a value determined by their relationship.
