Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4\), this condition is preserved. The other variables remain unaffected, and the only change is that `t` now holds the value of the input integer within the specified range.
