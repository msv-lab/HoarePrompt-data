Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the \( k \)-th card laid down by Vladislav based on a specific sequence.
2. The annotated program correctly implements the logic to find the \( k \)-th card. Here's a breakdown of the logic:
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the position of the \( k \)-th card using the formula \((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m\).
   - The variables `s` and `m` are used to keep track of the cumulative count of cards laid down and the multiplier for the current group of cards, respectively.
   - The loop breaks when the current group of cards (determined by the multiplier `m`) contains the \( k \)-th card.
3. The provided code matches the problem description and the example test cases. It correctly handles the constraints and the logic for determining the \( k \)-th card.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
