Output State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each input pair `(n, k)`, the output is calculated based on the given logic inside the loop. The final state of `t` remains unchanged, but the outputs for each `(n, k)` pair are printed according to the formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`.
