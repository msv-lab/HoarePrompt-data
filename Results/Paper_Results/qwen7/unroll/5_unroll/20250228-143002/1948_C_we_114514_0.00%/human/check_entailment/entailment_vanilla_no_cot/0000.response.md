Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, and for each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and the two rows of arrows.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The function `func_1` checks if the robot can reach the target cell (2, n) by iterating through each column and updating the reachability status of the first and second rows based on the direction of the arrows.
   - If the arrow in the first row points to the right (`>`), the robot can move to the next column in the first row. If it reaches the last column, it means it can potentially move to the second row.
   - If the arrow in the first row points to the left (`<`), the robot cannot stay in the first row and must move to the second row if the corresponding arrow in the second row points to the right.
   - The same logic applies to the second row, where the robot can only move to the right or potentially to the first row if the arrow points to the left.

3. **Output Generation**: The program appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on whether the robot can reach the target cell (2, n).

Given the constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the reachability of the target cell for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **True**.
