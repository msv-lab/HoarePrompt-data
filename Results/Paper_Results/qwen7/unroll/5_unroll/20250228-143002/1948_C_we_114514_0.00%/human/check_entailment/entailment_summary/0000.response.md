Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and initializes a list to store the test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n`, the first row of arrows (`row1`), and the second row of arrows (`row2`).
3. The function `func_1` processes each test case to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the movement rules.
4. The logic within `func_1` checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row using the arrows. Specifically:
   - It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if it can reach the end of the row or if moving to the second row with an arrow pointing right allows it to progress.
   - If the robot reaches the second row, it continues checking if the arrows allow it to move to the end of the second row.
5. The program correctly appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the results list based on whether the robot can reach the target cell `(2, n)`.

Given the execution summary and the analysis above, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
