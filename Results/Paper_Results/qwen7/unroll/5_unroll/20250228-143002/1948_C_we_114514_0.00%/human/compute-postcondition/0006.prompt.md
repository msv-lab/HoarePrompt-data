You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and test_cases is a list of test case descriptions. Each test case description is a tuple containing an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, n is even) and two strings, each of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        n, (row1, row2) = test_case
        
        reachable_first_row = True
        
        reachable_second_row = False
        
        for j in range(n):
            if reachable_first_row:
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
                else:
                    reachable_first_row = False
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable_second_row = True
            if reachable_second_row:
                if row2[j] == '>':
                    if j == n - 1:
                        reachable_second_row = True
        
        if reachable_second_row:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If `reachable_second_row` becomes `True` for a test case, 'YES' is appended to `results`; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If 'reachable_second_row' becomes True for a test case, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 2 and 2⋅10^5, inclusive, and even), and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function returns a list named 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second string can be reached from the first string following certain rules. If the condition for reaching the second string is met, 'YES' is appended to the results list; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list named 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If 'reachable_second_row' becomes True for a test case, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
