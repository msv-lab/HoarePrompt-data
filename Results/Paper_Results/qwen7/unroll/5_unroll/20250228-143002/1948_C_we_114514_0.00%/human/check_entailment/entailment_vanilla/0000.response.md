Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two rows of arrows.
2. **Test Case Storage**: The test cases are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the size of the grid `n` and a pair of strings representing the two rows of arrows.
3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1` with the parsed test cases and stores the results.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each test case.
   - It initializes flags `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track the robot's progress.
   - It checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row using the arrows.
   - If the robot reaches the last column in the second row (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot cannot reach the last column in the second row, it sets the result to `NO`.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The logic for determining if the robot can reach the last column in the second row is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1:` is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the last column.
- The logic does not properly handle the movement of the robot based on the arrows and the grid boundaries.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving until it reaches the last column in the second row.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable = False
        for j in range(n):
            if j == 0:  # Start at (1, 1)
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable = True
                    elif j == n - 1:
                        reachable = True
            else:
                if reachable:
                    if row2[j - 1] == '>':
                        if j == n - 1:
                            reachable = True
                    else:
                        reachable = False
                else:
                    if row1[j] == '>':
                        if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                            reachable = True
                        elif j == n - 1:
                            reachable = True
        if reachable:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

With this corrected logic, the program should correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **False**
