Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `test_case` which iterates over the `test_cases` list.

2. **Determine the necessary conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `test_cases` list.
   - When the loop starts, `test_case` will be set to the first element of the `test_cases` list.

3. **Adjust the states**:
   - `results` is an empty list and does not affect the loop execution directly.
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), but this does not affect the loop execution either.
   - `test_cases` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are related to the `test_cases` list. Specifically, `test_cases` must have at least one element for the loop to execute.

**Final State:**
State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `test_cases` is a list of test case descriptions that must have at least one element**
