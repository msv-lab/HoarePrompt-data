Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, inclusive, and even), and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. The function returns a list named 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second string can be reached from the first string following certain rules. If the condition for reaching the second string is met, 'YES' is appended to the results list; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.**
