You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

    #The program returns a list named 'results' that contains either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the second row can be reached from the first row following the rules defined in the loop. If 'reachable_second_row' becomes True for a test case, 'YES' is appended; otherwise, 'NO' is appended.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (between 2 and 2⋅10^5, inclusive, and even), and two strings of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and/or '>'. It processes each test case to determine if the second string can be reached from the first string following specific rules. If the second string can be reached, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. The function returns the resulting list of 'YES' and 'NO' values.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input for the number of test cases `t`, the size of the grid `n`, and the two rows of arrows.
2. **Test Case Storage**: The test cases are stored in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the size of the grid `n` and a pair of strings representing the two rows of arrows.
3. **Function Call**: The program calls `func_1` with the parsed test cases and stores the results.
4. **Function Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each test case.
   - It initializes flags `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` to track the robot's progress.
   - It checks if the robot can move from the first row to the second row using the arrows.
   - If the robot reaches the last column in the second row (`j == n - 1`), it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
   - If the robot cannot reach the last column in the second row, it sets the result to `NO`.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The logic for determining if the robot can reach the last column in the second row is flawed. Specifically, the condition `if j == n - 1:` is not sufficient to ensure the robot can reach the last column.
- The logic does not properly handle the movement of the robot based on the arrows and the grid boundaries.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then continue moving until it reaches the last column in the second row.

Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        reachable = False
        for j in range(n):
            if j == 0:  # Start at (1, 1)
                if row1[j] == '>':
                    if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                        reachable = True
                    elif j == n - 1:
                        reachable = True
            else:
                if reachable:
                    if row2[j - 1] == '>':
                        if j == n - 1:
                            reachable = True
                    else:
                        reachable = False
                else:
                    if row1[j] == '>':
                        if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                            reachable = True
                        elif j == n - 1:
                            reachable = True
        if reachable:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

With this corrected logic, the program should correctly determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n).
