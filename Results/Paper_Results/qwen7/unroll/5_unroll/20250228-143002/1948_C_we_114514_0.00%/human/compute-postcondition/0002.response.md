Output State: `results` is a list where each element is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether the second row can be reached from the first row based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if it's possible to move from the first row to the second row by following '>' characters, the corresponding list element is 'YES'; otherwise, it is 'NO'.
