Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The function correctly initializes variables and reads the number of test cases `t`, followed by processing each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint `mid` is calculated as `n // 2`, which is used to split the string into two halves. This is correct.

3. **Counting Zeros and Ones**: The function counts the number of zeros (`leftZero`, `rightZero`) and ones (`leftOne`, `rightOne`) on both sides of the midpoint. This is done correctly using two loops.

4. **Adjusting Indices**: The function uses two while loops to adjust the indices `left` and `right` to find the optimal split point. It correctly updates the counts of zeros and ones as it moves the split point. 

5. **Optimal Split Point Determination**: The function determines the optimal split point by checking the conditions for both sides of the split and choosing the one that minimizes the absolute difference from the center. This logic is correct.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the split is before the first house (`left == 0`) or after the last house (`right == n`). It also handles the case where multiple optimal points exist by choosing the one closer to the center.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
