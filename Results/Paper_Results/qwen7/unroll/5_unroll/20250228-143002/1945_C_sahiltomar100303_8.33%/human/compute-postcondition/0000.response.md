Output State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code.**

This means that `t` now holds the value entered as an integer from the input, constrained within the specified range, while `n` and `a` retain their initial states as defined in the precondition.
