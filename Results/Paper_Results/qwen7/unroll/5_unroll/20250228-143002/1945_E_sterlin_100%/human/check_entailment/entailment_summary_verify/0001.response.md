### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` after performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is defined correctly in the problem statement. It starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, and it continues until `r - l = 1`. Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `m` and updates `l` or `r` based on whether `p[m] <= x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is correctly described and implemented in the problem statement. The key point is to ensure that after the binary search, `p[l] == x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**: To ensure `p[l] == x` after the binary search, we need to place `x` at the correct position. This can be achieved by:
   - Finding the index of `x` in the permutation.
   - Placing `x` at position `l` (initially 1) using at most 2 swaps.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not contain the actual logic for solving the problem. Instead, it defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) which are typically used for reading input in Python.
   - There is no function that implements the logic to find the correct swaps to make `p[l] == x`.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the provided code does not implement the required logic to solve the problem. The utility functions alone do not suffice to solve the problem as stated.

6. **Function Summaries**:
   - The function summaries provided describe how the input is processed but do not indicate any implementation of the solution logic. This further supports the conclusion that the provided code is incomplete.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incomplete and does not implement the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

**Correctness: **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
