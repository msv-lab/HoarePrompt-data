Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects in the loop head: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `n`.
2. Determine the initial state of these variables:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute: The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the loop can start executing. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0**
