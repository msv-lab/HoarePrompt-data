The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times b \) or the rounded value of \( a \times \frac{c}{2} \), where \( c \) is derived from the input. It then prints the result for each test case. The final state of the program consists of a series of outputs, each representing the calculated value for the respective test case.
