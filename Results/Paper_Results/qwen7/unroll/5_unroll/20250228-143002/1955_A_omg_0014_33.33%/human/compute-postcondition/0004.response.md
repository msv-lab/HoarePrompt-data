Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, a, and b. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30, it does some unspecified processing and returns a result based on these inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing four integers: t, n, a, and b, with specific constraints on their values. The function then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result accordingly.
