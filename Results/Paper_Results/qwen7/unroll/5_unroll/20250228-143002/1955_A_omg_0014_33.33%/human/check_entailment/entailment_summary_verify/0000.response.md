### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements and the given examples.

1. **Problem Description and Requirements**:
   - Maxim needs to buy exactly \( n \) yogurts.
   - The price for one yogurt is \( a \) burles.
   - The price for two yogurts is \( b \) burles.
   - The goal is to minimize the total cost.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it calculates either \( a \times b \) or the rounded value of \( a \times \frac{c}{2} \), where \( c \) is derived from the input.
   - It then prints the result for each test case.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( n \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
   - It calculates \( d = \frac{c}{2} \), where \( c \) is not defined in the code, but it seems to be intended to be \( b \).
   - It compares \( a \times b \) with \( a \times d \) (which should be \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \)).
   - If \( a \times b \) is less than \( a \times d \), it prints \( a \times b \); otherwise, it prints the rounded value of \( a \times d \).

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - In the third test case (3 5 11):
     - The program calculates \( \frac{11}{2} = 5.5 \) and rounds it to 6.
     - It then prints \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \).
     - However, the correct approach is to buy 2 yogurts at the promotion price (11 burles) and 1 yogurt at the regular price (5 burles), resulting in a total cost of 15 burles.
   - The program fails to account for the optimal strategy of buying some yogurts individually and some in pairs.

5. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment is correct. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for buying the yogurts because it does not consider the optimal strategy of buying some yogurts individually and some in pairs.
   - The program always uses the rounded value of \( a \times \frac{b}{2} \) without considering other possible combinations that might yield a lower cost.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not account for the optimal strategy of buying some yogurts individually and some in pairs, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.
