The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of two lists. The first list contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the existing problems, and the second list contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the expected difficulties, with `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a_i, b_i <= 10^9`. After processing, the function returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the difficulties of the existing problems, and the second list contains `n` non-decreasing integers representing the expected difficulties, but both lists are sorted in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of two lists containing non-decreasing integers representing difficulties and expected difficulties. It returns a list of two lists where both lists are sorted in descending order.**
