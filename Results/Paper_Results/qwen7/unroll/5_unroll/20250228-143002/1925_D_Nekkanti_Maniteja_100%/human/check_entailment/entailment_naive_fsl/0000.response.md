Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions if the pair is chosen again. 

The program calculates `c` as the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs `(n * (n - 1) // 2)` modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but it does not properly incorporate the increasing friendship values into the calculation. Instead, it seems to attempt to use `c` and `m` in a way that does not reflect the problem's requirements.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

```
3
4 3 2
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
1 4 4
5 4 2
1 2 1
2 3 2
3 4 3
4 5 4
1 5 5
```

For the first test case (4 children, 3 pairs, 2 excursions):
- The pairs are (1,2), (2,3), and (3,4) with friendship values 1, 2, and 3 respectively.
- The expected value of the sum of friendship values for the two excursions would be calculated as follows:
  - For the first excursion, the expected value is the average of the friendship values of all pairs, which is \(\frac{1+2+3+4+5}{5} = 3\).
  - For the second excursion, if the same pair is chosen, the friendship value increases by 1, so the expected value would be adjusted accordingly.
- However, the program does not correctly handle this increase in friendship values and simply uses the initial friendship values without accounting for the increments.

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not meet the problem's requirements for calculating the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
