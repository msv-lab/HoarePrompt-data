Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5⋅10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each of the next m lines contains three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i such that a_i ≠ b_i, 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ n, and 1 ≤ f_i ≤ 10^9. After executing the loop, s is calculated as \(s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} (c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a)\) where \(c\) is the modular inverse of \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\), and a is the sum of all f_i values from the edges. The final value of s is then printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
