Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare it with the problem statement and the function summary to determine the accuracy of the original assessment.

### Problem Statement Analysis

1. **Objective**: Calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions.
2. **Key Points**:
   - If a pair of friends is chosen, their friendship value increases by 1 for all subsequent excursions.
   - The friendship value of a non-friend pair remains 0 and does not change.

### Function Summary Analysis

The function summary describes the process of reading input, calculating the modular inverse `c`, and then computing the sum `s` using the formula:
\[ s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\right) \mod M \]
where:
- \( c = \left(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\right)^{-1} \mod M \)
- \( a \) is the sum of all friendship values \( f_i \)

### Program Code Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).

2. **Calculating \( c \)**:
   - \( c \) is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of unique pairs \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This step is correct.

3. **Summing Friendship Values**:
   - The program sums up all the friendship values \( f_i \) into `a`. This part is also correct.

4. **Calculating \( s \)**:
   - The formula used in the program is:
     \[ s = \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \left(c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a\right) \mod M \]
   - Let's break down this formula:
     - \( c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m \) represents the contribution of each excursion to the expected value, considering the number of pairs \( m \) and the modular inverse \( c \).
     - \( c \cdot a \) represents the contribution of the initial friendship values.
   - This formula correctly accounts for the fact that the friendship value of a chosen pair increases by 1 for each subsequent excursion.

### Verification

Given the problem statement and the function summary, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The formula used in the program accurately reflects the expected value calculation, taking into account the increasing friendship values for chosen pairs.

### Conclusion

The original assessment stated that the program does not correctly calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values because it does not account for the increasing friendship values. However, upon closer inspection, the program does correctly handle this aspect through the formula used.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
