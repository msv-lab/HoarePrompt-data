Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - `M` is set to \(10^9 + 7\), which is used as the modulus.
   - `c` is calculated as the modular inverse of the total number of pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(M\).

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - `s` is initialized to 0.
   - `a` is initialized to 0 and is used to accumulate the sum of friendship values from all pairs of friends.
   - For each of the `m` pairs of friends, the program reads the indices `u`, `v`, and the friendship value `f`.
   - It adds the friendship value `f` to `a`.

4. **Expected Value Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values for `k` excursions.
   - It uses the formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` to update `s` for each excursion.
   - Finally, it prints the result modulo \(M\).

### Issues Identified:

1. **Modular Inverse Calculation:**
   - The line `c = pow(n * (n - 1) // 2, -1, M)` assumes that the total number of pairs \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) is coprime with \(M\). This is not necessarily true for all values of `n` and `M`. The modular inverse might not exist if \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) and \(M\) are not coprime.

2. **Incorrect Formula:**
   - The formula `s = s + c * i * c * m + c * a` is incorrect. The expected value calculation should consider the probability of picking each pair and the effect of the friendship value increasing over time.
   - Specifically, the expected value for each pair of friends being chosen in `k` excursions should be calculated correctly, taking into account the probability of being chosen and the increase in friendship value.

### Correct Approach:

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for each pair of friends being chosen in `k` excursions. The correct approach involves calculating the probability of each pair being chosen and updating the expected value accordingly.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
