### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array `arr` is already sorted in non-decreasing order using the condition `all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns `'Yes'`.
- Otherwise, it checks if there is any pair of consecutive elements where the current element is greater than the next element using `any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))`.
  - If there is such a pair, it returns `'No'`.
  - If there is no such pair, it implicitly returns `'Yes'`.

The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is at least one pair of elements that are out of order. It does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through valid splits and swaps to make it non-decreasing.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles the input reading and processing, but the logic in `func_1` is still flawed.

#### Example Test Case Analysis:
Consider the example test case provided in the problem description:

- **Test Case 1:** `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`
  - The array is not sorted, and there is no way to split and swap to make it sorted.
  - `func_1` returns `'No'` correctly.

- **Test Case 2:** `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`
  - The array can be split and swapped to become sorted.
  - By splitting into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]` and swapping, we get `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`.
  - This array can be further adjusted by another swap to achieve a sorted array `[2, 2, 3, 7, 9]`.
  - However, `func_1` returns `'No'` because it does not recognize this possibility.

- **Test Case 3:** `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The array is already sorted.
  - `func_1` returns `'Yes'` correctly.

Based on the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle all potential cases correctly, as demonstrated by the example test case.
