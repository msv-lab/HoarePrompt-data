### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to determine if an array can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them. `func_1` should check if the array is already non-decreasing. If not, it should use `func_2` to process multiple test cases.

2. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - The function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order using `all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))`.
   - If the array is sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
   - If the array is not sorted, it uses `any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)))` to check if there is at least one pair of elements where the current element is greater than the next one.
     - If such a pair exists, it returns 'No'.
     - If no such pair exists, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and prints the results.
   - It reads the total number of test cases (`t`), then for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It calls `func_1` for each array and appends the result to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it prints the results, one per line.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - `func_1` correctly identifies if an array is already sorted or if it can be sorted by a single swap operation.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results.

Given the problem statement and the implementation, the functions appear to be correct.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
