Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into a prefix and a suffix and swapping them.
- The provided code has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted or if there is at most one place where the array is out of order. This is because if the array is already sorted, no operation is needed. If there is exactly one place where the array is out of order, we can split the array at that point and swap the parts to sort the array.
- `func_2` reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, `func_1` correctly identifies if an array can be sorted by the described operation. `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and uses `func_1` appropriately.
- Therefore, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
