Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as described. The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, but this is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping as described. 

To correctly solve the problem, you need to check if there exists a way to split the array such that the resulting concatenated array is non-decreasing. The current implementation of `func_1` does not account for the possibility of rearranging parts of the array through the specified operation.

Here's a corrected approach:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    # Find the index where the array breaks the non-decreasing order
    break_index = -1
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            break_index = i
            break
    
    if break_index == -1:
        return 'Yes'
    
    # Check if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting at break_index
    left_max = max(arr[:break_index + 1])
    right_min = min(arr[break_index + 1:])
    
    # Check if the left part's maximum is less than or equal to the right part's minimum
    if left_max <= right_min:
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'

# Function 2 remains the same
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

This corrected version of `func_1` checks if there is a valid split point where the left part's maximum value is less than or equal to the right part's minimum value, which would allow the array to be rearranged into a non-decreasing order.
