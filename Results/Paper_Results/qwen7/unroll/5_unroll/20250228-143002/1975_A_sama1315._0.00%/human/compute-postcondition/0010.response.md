Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the array), and a list arr (containing n integers). For each test case, it checks the conditions on t, n, and arr and performs operations based on these conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing a number of test cases (t), the length of an array (n), and the array itself (arr). It validates the input according to specified constraints and then proceeds to perform operations for each test case.
