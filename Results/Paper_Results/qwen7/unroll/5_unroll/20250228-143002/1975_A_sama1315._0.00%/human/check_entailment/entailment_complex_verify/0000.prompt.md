You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers of length n where 2 <= n <= 50 and each element in the list satisfies 1 <= arr_i <= 10^6.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: arr is a list of positive integers of length n where 2 <= n <= 50 and each element in the list satisfies 1 <= arr_i <= 10^6, and there exists at least one index i such that arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No' if no element in the list `arr` is greater than the next element, otherwise it returns 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `arr` with a length between 2 and 50, inclusive, and each element in the list is between 1 and 10^6, inclusive. It checks if any element in the list is greater than the next element. If such an element is found, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. arr is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, representing the elements of the array a.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 6, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1` on each array slice defined by `data[index:index + n]`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of calling func_1 on each slice of data from index 6 to n, separated by newlines
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the array), and a list arr (containing n integers). For each test case, it calls `func_1` on the array arr, stores the result, and collects all results in a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is already non-decreasing, but it does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through valid splits and swaps.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
5
7 9 2 2 3
3
1 2 3
```

Expected Output:
```
No
Yes
Yes
```

However, the provided program would output:
```
No
No
Yes
```

This is incorrect because for the second test case `[7, 9, 2, 2, 3]`, the program fails to recognize that the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. Specifically, splitting into `x = [7]` and `y = [9, 2, 2, 3]` and then swapping them results in `[9, 2, 2, 3, 7]`, which is not sorted but can be further adjusted by another swap to achieve a sorted array.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
