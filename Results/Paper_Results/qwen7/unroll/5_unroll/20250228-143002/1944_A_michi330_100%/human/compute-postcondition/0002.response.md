Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either "1" or the value of `n` depending on whether `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` for each iteration of the loop. Since `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, there will be between 1 and 10^3 lines in the output, each containing either "1" or the value of `n` from the corresponding input.
