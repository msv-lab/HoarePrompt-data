Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where destroying fewer than \(n-1\) bridges still isolates some islands from island 1. Specifically, consider the following scenario:

- For \(n = 4\) and \(k = 1\), the program incorrectly outputs 4 instead of 3. If Dominater destroys one bridge, say between islands 2 and 3, Everule can still visit islands 1, 2, and 4 by going through island 1 to island 2 and then to island 4, or directly to island 4. However, the program does not account for this scenario and always outputs the maximum possible value of \(n\).

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the minimum number of islands that can be isolated from island 1, which involves more complex logic than simply checking if \(k \geq n-1\).
