Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer t and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}. For each test case, it sorts the 2n integers, selects every second element from the sorted list, sums these elements, and repeats this process t times. Finally, it prints the sum of every second element for each test case, repeated t times.**
