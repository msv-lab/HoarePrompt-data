Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` is an input string, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

Explanation: The code `num = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `num`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code. The value of `n` is not directly assigned by this line of code; it is inferred that `n` will be an integer read in the subsequent lines of the code, but its exact value is not known at this point.
