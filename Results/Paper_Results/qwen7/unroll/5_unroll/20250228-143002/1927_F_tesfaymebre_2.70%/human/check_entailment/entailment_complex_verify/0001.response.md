### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly reads the number of vertices `n` and edges `m` for each test case.
   - It reads the edges and stores them in a graph representation using an adjacency list.

2. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This is crucial for the next steps.

3. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components.
   - For each edge, it checks if the two vertices belong to the same component. If they do, it merges them and updates the minimum edge weight in the component.
   - If they don't, it merges them without updating the minimum edge weight.

4. **Finding the Minimum Edge Cycle:**
   - After processing all edges, it identifies the component with the smallest minimum edge weight.
   - It then uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a cycle starting from the vertex with the smallest minimum edge weight.
   - The DFS ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices).

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is correctly represented using an adjacency list.

2. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in reverse order, which is necessary to ensure that the first cycle found is the one with the minimum lightest edge.

3. **DSU Operations:**
   - The DSU operations are correctly implemented to merge components and update the minimum edge weight.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The DFS correctly finds a simple cycle starting from the vertex with the smallest minimum edge weight.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the required format, including the weight of the lightest edge, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices themselves.

### Detailed Verification

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using a dictionary where each key is a vertex, and the value is a list of tuples containing adjacent vertices and their corresponding edge weights. This is correct and efficient for the given problem.

2. **Edge Sorting:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order based on their weights. This ensures that the first cycle found will have the minimum lightest edge, which is a critical requirement.

3. **DSU Operations:**
   - The DSU class is correctly implemented. It uses path compression and union by size to efficiently manage connected components and update the minimum edge weights. This ensures that the component with the smallest minimum edge weight is identified correctly.

4. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The DFS function correctly detects cycles and ensures that the cycle is simple. It uses a `colors` array to keep track of visited nodes and avoids revisiting nodes, ensuring the cycle is simple.

5. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints the weight of the lightest edge in the cycle, the number of vertices in the cycle, and the vertices themselves in traversal order. This matches the required output format.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic is sound and follows the problem requirements correctly. The program handles all aspects of the problem, including reading input, sorting edges, using DSU to manage components, and finding the desired cycle.
