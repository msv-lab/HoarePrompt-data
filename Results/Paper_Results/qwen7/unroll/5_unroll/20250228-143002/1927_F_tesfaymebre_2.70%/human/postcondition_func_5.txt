The function processes an undirected graph represented by its number of vertices (`n`), number of edges (`m`), and adjacency list (`graph`). It then finds the minimum-weight cycle in the graph using a union-find data structure and depth-first search (DFS). Finally, it prints the weight of the minimum-weight cycle and the nodes involved in this cycle.
