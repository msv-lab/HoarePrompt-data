test_cases is an integer such that 1 ≤ test_cases ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and m such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2⋅10^5), followed by m lines, each containing three integers u, v, and w representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6.
