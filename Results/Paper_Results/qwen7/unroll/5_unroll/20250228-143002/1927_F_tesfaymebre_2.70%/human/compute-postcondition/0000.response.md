Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `test_cases` ≤ 10^4 after being assigned the value returned by `func_1()`.**

Explanation: The code `test_cases = func_1()` assigns the value returned by the function `func_1()` to the variable `test_cases`. The initial condition for `test_cases` is that it is an integer within the range 1 to \(10^4\). After executing this line, `test_cases` retains its property of being an integer within this range, but its specific value is now determined by the return value of `func_1()`. All other variables remain in their initial state as no other assignments or changes are made in the given code snippet.
