Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, it processes two integers n and m, where 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ ⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋ and m ≤ 2⋅10^5. It then processes m lines, each containing three integers u, v, and w, representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The function does not return any specific value but processes the input data according to the described structure.**
