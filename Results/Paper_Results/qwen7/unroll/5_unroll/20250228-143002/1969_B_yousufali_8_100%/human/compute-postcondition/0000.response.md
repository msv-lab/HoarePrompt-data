Output State: **`t` is an input integer, and for each test case, a binary string `s` is provided on a new line with 2 <= |s| <= 2 * 10^5, where each character in `s` is either '0' or '1'.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, a binary string `s` is expected to be provided on a new line. The initial state of `t` being an integer representing the number of test cases is updated to the actual input integer value. The precondition regarding the binary strings remains unchanged.
