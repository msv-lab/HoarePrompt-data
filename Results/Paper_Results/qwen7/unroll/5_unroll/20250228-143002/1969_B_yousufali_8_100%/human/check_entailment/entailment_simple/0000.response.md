Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The annotated program consists of two functions:
   - `func_1()`: This function processes a single binary string and calculates the cost of making it sorted.
   - `func_2()`: This function handles multiple test cases by calling `func_1()` for each test case.

3. For a single binary string, the logic in `func_1()` is as follows:
   - It iterates through the string and counts the number of '1's (`n`) before encountering a '0'.
   - If a '0' is found and there have been at least one '1' before it, it adds `n + 1` to the total cost (`ans`).
   - This logic correctly calculates the cost of the minimum number of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string because each '0' that comes after a sequence of '1's needs to be moved past those '1's, which costs `n + 1`.

4. The logic in `func_2()` is as follows:
   - It reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - It calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - Since `func_1()` does not modify any global state except for printing the result, and it correctly computes the cost for each test case, the overall solution is correct.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
