### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

#### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made, so the number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each card number.
   - However, the logic inside `func_1` does not correctly handle the problem requirements. Specifically, it reduces the count of any card number to `k` if it exceeds `k`, which is not necessary for solving the problem.

4. **Finding Minimum Cards:**
   - After calculating the frequencies, the program checks if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary.
     - If `k` is in the values, it prints `k - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Issues in the Program

- **Incorrect Frequency Calculation:**
  - The function `func_1` incorrectly limits the frequency of any card to `k` if it exceeds `k`. This is unnecessary and incorrect for the problem.
  
- **Logic for Finding Minimum Cards:**
  - The logic of checking if `k` is in the values of the frequency dictionary and printing `k - 1` is flawed. This approach does not correctly determine the minimum number of cards that can be left.

### Correct Approach

To solve the problem correctly:
1. Calculate the frequency of each card number.
2. Determine how many groups of `k` cards can be formed.
3. Calculate the remaining cards after performing the maximum possible exchanges.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Calculate the frequency of each card number
    freq = {}
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] = freq.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards left
    min_cards = 0
    for count in freq.values():
        min_cards += (count // k) * (k - 1)
    
    # Add the remaining cards that cannot form a complete group of k
    min_cards += sum(count % k for count in freq.values())
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - We calculate the frequency of each card number using a dictionary `freq`.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cards:**
   - For each frequency count, we calculate how many complete groups of `k` cards can be formed (`count // k`) and add `(k - 1)` cards for each complete group.
   - We also add the remaining cards that cannot form a complete group of `k` (`count % k`).

### Conclusion

The original program is incorrect due to the flawed frequency calculation and logic for determining the minimum number of cards. The corrected program provided above addresses these issues and correctly solves the problem.

Therefore, the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
