The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `test_cases`. `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

The function processes each tuple in the `test_cases` list, where each tuple contains the number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. Based on these inputs, the function calculates the lengths of the sticks using the formula 2^{a_i} for each exponent `a_i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the number of sticks and their corresponding exponents. It calculates the lengths of the sticks using the given exponents and returns the lengths.**
