Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed using the given sticks, where each polygon must have equal sides and no stick can be reused.
- The provided program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it correctly reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
- It then counts the occurrences of each stick length using a dictionary.
- Finally, it calculates the number of polygons by dividing the count of each stick length by 3 (since each polygon needs 3 sides).

However, there are a couple of issues with the current implementation:
1. The function `func_1` is called without parameters, but it expects input which is not provided in the loop.
2. The logic to calculate the maximum number of polygons is flawed because it does not ensure that the polygons can be formed simultaneously. It simply divides the count of each stick length by 3 without considering the possibility of forming multiple polygons.

Given the above points, the current implementation does not fully address the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
