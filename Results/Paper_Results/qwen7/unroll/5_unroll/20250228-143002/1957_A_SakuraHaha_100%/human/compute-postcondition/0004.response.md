Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for x in a:`. Here, the objects involved are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, assigning each element to the variable `x` in turn.

3. **Determine the initial state of `x` and `a`**:
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
   - `x` will take on the value of each element in `a` during each iteration of the loop.

4. **Initial values**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\).
   - `a` is a list of integers.
   - `ans` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).
   - `cnt` is an empty dictionary (this is not directly relevant to the loop head).

5. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since the loop will iterate over the elements of `a`, `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.
   - The initial value of `x` is not specified, but it will take on the value of each element in `a` during the iterations.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `a` must have at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `ans` is 0, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**.
