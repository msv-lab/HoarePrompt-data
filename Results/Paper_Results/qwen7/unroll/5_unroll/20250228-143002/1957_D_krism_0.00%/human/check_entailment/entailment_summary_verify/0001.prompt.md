You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

- Program:
T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    print('-----------------')
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix = [0]
    for v in arr:
        prefix.append(v ^ prefix[-1])
    print(arr, prefix)
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if cur >> j & 1:
                suf[j][1] += 1
            else:
                suf[j][0] += 1
    print(pre)
    print(suf)
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        y = arr[i - 1]
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        c = prefix[i]
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1
                suf[j][1] -= 1
            else:
                pre[j][0] += 1
                suf[j][0] -= 1
    print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It calculates and returns a result based on the cumulative XOR values of the list elements. Specifically, it computes the sum of the products of the number of zeros and ones for each bit position from 0 to 31, derived from the cumulative XOR values of the array elements. The function does not return any value directly but prints the final result.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `n` of the array and the array itself.
   - It computes the prefix XOR values and stores them in the `prefix` list.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR values are correctly computed using the formula \( \text{prefix}[i] = \text{arr}[i-1] \oplus \text{prefix}[i-1] \).
   - This part is correct and necessary for further computations.

3. **Pre and Suffix Arrays Initialization:**
   - Two arrays `pre` and `suf` are initialized to store counts of zeros and ones for each bit position.
   - The `pre` array is initialized with all elements set to `[1, 0]`, meaning initially, there is one occurrence of zero and zero occurrences of one for each bit position.
   - The `suf` array is similarly initialized but will be updated from right to left.

4. **Updating Pre and Suffix Arrays:**
   - The `pre` array is updated from left to right, counting the number of zeros and ones for each bit position up to the current index.
   - The `suf` array is updated from right to left, counting the number of zeros and ones for each bit position starting from the current index.
   - These updates are necessary to count the number of valid tuples.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - For each index `i`, the program calculates the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` using the `pre` and `suf` arrays.
   - The logic for counting valid tuples seems to be based on the bit positions, which is a good approach to handle large numbers efficiently.
   - However, the exact logic for counting valid tuples needs to be verified.

6. **Updating Bit Counts:**
   - After calculating the number of valid tuples for the current index `i`, the program updates the `pre` and `suf` arrays to reflect the changes due to including the current element in the prefix.

### Verification of Logic

The core logic of the program aims to count the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` such that:
\[ f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \]

This can be translated to:
\[ (a_x \oplus a_{x+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_y) \oplus (a_y \oplus a_{y+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_z) > a_x \oplus a_{x+1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_z \]

By breaking this down into bit positions and counting the number of zeros and ones, the program attempts to efficiently count the valid tuples. The logic for updating the `pre` and `suf` arrays and the final count of valid tuples appears to be sound.

### Conclusion

Given the detailed analysis, the program seems to follow the correct approach to solve the problem. The implementation of the algorithm is logically sound and should produce the correct results for the given constraints.
