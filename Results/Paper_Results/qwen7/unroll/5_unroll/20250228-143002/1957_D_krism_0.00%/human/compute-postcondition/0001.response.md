Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5, and n is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and the precondition regarding the sum of all n values across all test cases also remains valid.
