Output State: **`prefix` is a list containing the cumulative XOR of elements from `arr`. The first element is 0, followed by the XOR of each element in `arr` with the previous cumulative XOR result; `pre` is a list of lists containing [0, 0] repeated 32 times.**

Explanation: The code initializes a 2D list `pre` with 32 elements, each being a list `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the `prefix` list, which remains unchanged from its initial state. Therefore, the `prefix` list retains its original definition and values, while `pre` is updated to contain `[0, 0]` repeated 32 times.
