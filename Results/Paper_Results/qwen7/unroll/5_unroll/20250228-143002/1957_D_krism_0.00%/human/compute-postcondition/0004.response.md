Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `v` and the iterable `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `prefix` is a list containing only the integer 0.
   - `v` is the variable that will iterate over each element in `arr`.
   - `arr` is the iterable that `v` will loop through.

3. **Understand the condition for loop execution**: For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**: Since `prefix` is already defined and its state does not affect the loop's execution, we only need to adjust the state of `arr` to ensure the loop can execute.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the state of `arr` to ensure it has at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`prefix` is a list containing only the integer 0, `arr` must have at least one element**
