Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 10^5; arr is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code reads a line of space-separated integers from the input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into a list of strings. The `map(int, ...)` function then converts each string in the list to an integer. The resulting list of integers is assigned to the variable `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
