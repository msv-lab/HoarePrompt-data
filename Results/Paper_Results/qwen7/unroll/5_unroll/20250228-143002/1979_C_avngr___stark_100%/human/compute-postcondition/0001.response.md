Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` and the list `numbers`.
2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop iterates over `numbers[1:]`, meaning it starts from the second element of the list `numbers`.
3. **Determine the initial state required for the loop to execute**:
   - The list `numbers` must have at least two elements because the loop starts from `numbers[1:]`.
   - The variable `num` will take the value of the second element of `numbers` in the first iteration.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `numbers` has at least two elements and that `result` is set to the first element of `numbers`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **List `numbers`**: Since the loop starts from `numbers[1:]`, `numbers` must have at least two elements.
2. **Variable `num`**: In the first iteration, `num` will be the second element of `numbers`.
3. **Variable `result`**: According to the given state, `result` is already set to the first element of `numbers`.

### Final State Adjustment:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element of `numbers`, and `result` is equal to the first element of `numbers`**.
