### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to understand its behavior and verify if it correctly solves the given problem.

#### Input Parsing:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k_i`.

#### Key Functions:
1. **func_1(a, b):**
   - This function calculates the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - Given the constraints \(2 \leq a, b \leq 20\), the GCD operation ensures that the result is an integer within a reasonable range.

2. **func_2(numbers):**
   - This function computes the product of all elements in the list `numbers` using the `func_1` function.
   - It iterates through the list and applies `func_1` to accumulate the product.

#### Main Logic:
- After computing the product `m` using `func_2`, the program attempts to distribute the coins.
- It initializes an empty list `c` and fills it with values `m // k[i]` for each outcome.
- It then checks if the sum of the values in `c` is less than or equal to `m`.
- If the sum is greater than or equal to `m`, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
- Otherwise, it prints the values in `c`.

#### Analysis:
- The core issue with the provided program is that it does not ensure the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.
- The computed product `m` from `func_2` is the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, but this does not guarantee that the total bet will be strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.
- The program's approach of distributing the coins as `m // k[i]` does not necessarily satisfy the condition that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

#### Example:
Consider the input:
```
3
3 2 7
```
- The LCM of 3, 2, and 7 is 42 (since `func_2([3, 2, 7])` would compute this).
- The program distributes the coins as `42 // 3`, `42 // 2`, and `42 // 7`, resulting in `14`, `21`, and `6`.
- The total bet is `14 + 21 + 6 = 41`, which is less than 42. However, this does not guarantee that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not ensure that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome.
