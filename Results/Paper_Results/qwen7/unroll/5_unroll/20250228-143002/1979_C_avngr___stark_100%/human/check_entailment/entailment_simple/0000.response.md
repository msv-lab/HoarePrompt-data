Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for any winning outcome. The key is to ensure that the sum of the bets is less than the product of the multipliers for all outcomes.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It then calculates the required bet amounts for each outcome such that the sum of these bets is less than the LCM.
   - If the sum of the calculated bets is not less than the LCM, it prints `-1`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers \(a\) and \(b\) using the formula \(\text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}\).
   - This is correct since the LCM of two numbers is their product divided by their GCD.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calculates the LCM of a list of numbers by iteratively applying `func_1` to pairs of numbers.
   - This is also correct because the LCM of a set of numbers is the product of the numbers divided by their GCD, and this can be computed iteratively.

5. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic correctly uses the LCM to determine the minimum total bet that would make the condition impossible to satisfy.
   - It then checks if the sum of the calculated bets is less than this LCM and prints `-1` if not.

6. **Output**:
   - The output format matches the requirements, either printing `-1` or the sequence of bets.

Given the above analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
