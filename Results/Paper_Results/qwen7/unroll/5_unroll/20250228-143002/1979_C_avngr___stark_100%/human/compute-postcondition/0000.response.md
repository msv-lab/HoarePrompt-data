Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers where each integer represents the multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and `result` is equal to the first element of the `numbers` list.**

This means that the `result` variable now holds the value of the first element in the `numbers` list, while the rest of the list remains unchanged.
