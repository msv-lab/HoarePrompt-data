Reasoning:
1. The problem requires distributing coins across different outcomes such that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
2. The provided code uses `func_2` to calculate a single value (`m`) which is the product of all multipliers. This value is then used to determine the distribution of coins (`c`) by dividing `m` by each multiplier.
3. The logic in the main loop checks if the sum of the distributed coins is greater than or equal to `m`. If it is, it prints `-1` indicating no valid distribution exists. Otherwise, it prints the distribution of coins.
4. The `func_1` function correctly computes the product of two numbers divided by their gcd, ensuring the result is an integer.
5. The `func_2` function correctly computes the product of all multipliers in the list, which is used as the reference value `m`.
6. The main loop logic correctly implements the requirement to ensure the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the provided code correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
