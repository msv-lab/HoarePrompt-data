### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**: The goal is to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount of coins received back for each possible winning outcome. This means for each \( k_i \), the sum of all bets should be less than \( k_i \times \text{bet on } i \)-th outcome.

2. **Given Code**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: Computes the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: Computes the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of integers using the GCD function.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - **Function 2**: Calculates the LCM of a list of integers.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The problem requires us to find a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. However, the provided functions do not help in achieving this.
   - The LCM calculation (which is what `func_2` does) is not directly relevant to the problem at hand. The LCM of a set of multipliers does not help in determining a valid distribution of bets.

5. **Example Input**:
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     3 2 7
     ```
   - The correct output should be a distribution of bets such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any outcome. For instance, a valid solution could be:
     ```
     27 41 12
     ```
   - The total bet is \( 27 + 41 + 12 = 80 \).
   - If the first outcome wins, you get \( 3 \times 27 = 81 \) coins.
   - If the second outcome wins, you get \( 2 \times 41 = 82 \) coins.
   - If the third outcome wins, you get \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \) coins.
   - All these values are strictly greater than 80, satisfying the condition.

6. **Current Implementation**:
   - The current implementation uses `func_2` to compute the LCM of the multipliers, but this does not help in finding a valid distribution of bets.
   - The functions do not contain any logic to distribute the coins in a way that meets the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not solve the problem correctly because it does not implement the necessary logic to distribute the coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the winnings for any winning outcome. The use of LCM is irrelevant to the problem.

**Final: False**
