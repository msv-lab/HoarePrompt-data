You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

- Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `q` where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array `a` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries each defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the borders of the subarray. For each query, it checks if the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" and prints 'YES' if the subarray is good, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output based on the queries.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `a` and processes `q` queries.
   
2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is intended to process each test case.
   - It initializes `b` as a prefix sum array where `b[i]` represents the sum of the first `i` elements of `a` with a specific transformation applied.
   - Specifically, `b[i] = b[i-1] + x` where `x = 1` if `a[i] > 1` else `x = 2`. This transformation ensures that each element in `b` is at least 1 and at least twice the value of the corresponding element in `a`.

3. **Accumulate Function:**
   - The program uses `list(accumulate(a))` to compute the prefix sums of `a`. However, this is unnecessary because `b` already serves the purpose of storing the transformed prefix sums.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program checks if the subarray `c[l_i], c[l_i+1], ..., c[r_i]` is good.
   - The condition for a subarray to be good is:
     1. The sum of the subarray should equal the sum of the corresponding transformed subarray in `b`.
     2. No element in the subarray should be equal to the corresponding element in the transformed subarray.
     3. All elements in the transformed subarray should be positive.
   - The program checks these conditions using the prefix sums stored in `a` and `b`.

### Detailed Check

1. **Sum Condition:**
   - The sum of the subarray `c[l_i], c[l_i+1], ..., c[r_i]` is `a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1]`.
   - The sum of the corresponding transformed subarray in `b` is `b[r_i] - b[l_i - 1]`.
   - The program correctly checks if `a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1] < b[r_i] - b[l_i - 1]` or `x == y` (which is always false since `x` and `y` are indices).

2. **Equality and Positivity Conditions:**
   - The program does not explicitly check if `a_i != b_i` for every index `i` from `l_i` to `r_i`.
   - The condition `a[r_i] - a[l_i - 1] < b[r_i] - b[l_i - 1]` implies that the sum of the subarray in `a` is less than the sum of the transformed subarray in `b`, which is not sufficient to guarantee that no element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in the transformed subarray.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the subarray is good. Specifically, it fails to ensure that no element in the subarray is equal to the corresponding element in the transformed subarray.
