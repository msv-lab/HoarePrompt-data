Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
An array a of length m is considered good if there exists an integer array b
of length m such that the following conditions hold:

  1. \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{m} b_i ; 
  2. a_i \neq b_i for every index i from 1 to m ; 
  3. b_i > 0 for every index i from 1 to m . 

You are given an array c of length n . Each element of this array is greater
than 0 .

You have to answer q queries. During the i -th query, you have to determine
whether the subarray c_{l_{i}}, c_{l_{i}+1}, \dots, c_{r_{i}} is good.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \le n, q \le
3 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array c and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n (1
\le c_i \le 10^9 ).

Then q lines follow. The i -th of them contains two integers l_i and r_i (1
\le l_i \le r_i \le n ) — the borders of the i -th subarray.

Additional constraints on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 ; the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, print YES if the subarray is good. Otherwise, print NO.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5 4
    
    1 2 1 4 5
    
    1 5
    
    4 4
    
    3 4
    
    1 3

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO

# Annotated Program:
from itertools import accumulate

for _ in range(int(input())):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array c of length n where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and q queries each defined by a pair of integers l_i and r_i representing the borders of the subarray to check if it is good.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: n is an integer, q is an integer, t is a positive integer, a is a list starting with 0 followed by integers, b is a list where each element b[i] (for i from 1 to n) is the sum of b[0] and the value 1 if a[i] > 1 or 2 otherwise for all previous elements.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: a is a list of cumulative sums, b is a list where each element b[i] is the sum of b[0] and the value 1 if a[i] > 1 or 2 otherwise for all previous elements, n is an integer, q is an integer, t is a positive integer, the loop has executed q times with user inputs (x, y), and printed 'NO' if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y, otherwise printed 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t`, followed by pairs of integers `n` and `q` where 1 <= n, q <= 3 * 10^5, an array `a` of length `n` where each element is a positive integer not exceeding 10^9, and `q` queries each defined by a pair of integers `l_i` and `r_i` representing the borders of the subarray. For each query, it checks if the subarray from index `l_i` to `r_i` is "good" and prints 'YES' if the subarray is good, otherwise prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but modifies the standard output based on the queries.
