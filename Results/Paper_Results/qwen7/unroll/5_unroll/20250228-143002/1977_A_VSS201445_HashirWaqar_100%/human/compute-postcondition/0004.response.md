Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input and the values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case from subsequent lines.**
