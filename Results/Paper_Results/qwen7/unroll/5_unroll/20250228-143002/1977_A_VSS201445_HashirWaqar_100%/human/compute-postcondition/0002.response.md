Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`. For each test case provided by the input, if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
