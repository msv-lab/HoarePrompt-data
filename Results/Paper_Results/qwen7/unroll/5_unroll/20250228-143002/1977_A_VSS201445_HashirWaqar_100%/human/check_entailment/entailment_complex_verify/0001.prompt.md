You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the condition `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0`. For each test case provided by the input, if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it checks if \( n \) is greater than or equal to \( m \) and if the difference between \( n \) and \( m \) is even. If both conditions are met, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function reads the number of test cases from the first line of input and the values of \( n \) and \( m \) for each test case from subsequent lines.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's reason through the given program step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which indicates the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.
   - It also checks if the difference `(n - m)` is even.

3. **Output:**
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Analysis:

- **Condition 1:** `n >= m`
  - This condition ensures that the number of moves `n` is at least as large as the desired number of cubes `m`. Since each move can either add or remove one cube, `n` must be at least `m` to possibly achieve `m` cubes.

- **Condition 2:** `(n - m) % 2 == 0`
  - This condition ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even. 
  - Each move can change the number of cubes by +1 or -1. To go from `n` cubes to `m` cubes, the total number of moves (difference) must be even because adding and removing cubes alternately will always result in an even difference.

### Verification:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Input: `3 3`
  - `n = 3`, `m = 3`
  - `3 >= 3` is true.
  - `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Output: `YES`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Input: `2 4`
  - `n = 2`, `m = 4`
  - `2 >= 4` is false.
  - Output: `NO`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Input: `5 3`
  - `n = 5`, `m = 3`
  - `5 >= 3` is true.
  - `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` is true.
  - Output: `YES`

The program correctly implements the logic required to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:

The program is correct according to the problem description.
