Reasoning:
1. The program correctly initializes the field and extracts necessary data such as player positions, goal locations, and the initial position of the Quaffle and Bludger.
2. The program processes each action step by step, updating the positions of players and the Quaffle accordingly.
3. Function `func_1` correctly updates the position of an object (player or Bludger) based on the direction of movement.
4. Function `func_2` correctly identifies and eliminates players when they are in the same position as the Bludger.
5. The program correctly handles scoring events and prints the appropriate messages for each scoring and elimination event.
6. The final score is correctly calculated and printed at the end of the game.

Given that the program follows the problem description accurately and handles all aspects of the game as specified, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
