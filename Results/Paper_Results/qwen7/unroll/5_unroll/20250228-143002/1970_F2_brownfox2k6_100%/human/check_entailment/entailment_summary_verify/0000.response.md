### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided functions and the overall logic of the program based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
- This function is responsible for moving an object on a 2D grid.
- It correctly handles the four possible directions: Up, Down, Left, and Right.
- However, it does not check if the movement is within the bounds of the field (N x M).
- It does not handle the specific rules of the game, such as preventing a player from moving into a cell with a Bludger or a player from catching or throwing a ball.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
- This function processes the current positions of players and the Bludger at a given time step.
- It identifies any players whose positions match the Bludger's position and marks them as eliminated by updating their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
- It prints a message for each eliminated player indicating they have been eliminated at the current time step.
- The function correctly handles the requirement to print the elimination messages in alphabetical order.

However, the original assessment is incomplete because it does not consider the following points:

1. **Movement Constraints**: The function `func_1` should include checks to ensure that movements are within the bounds of the field and do not result in collisions with Bludgers or other players.
2. **Ball Handling**: The program does not handle the logic for catching and throwing the Quaffle, which is crucial for scoring.
3. **Goal Scoring**: The program does not implement the logic for scoring points when a player successfully scores in the opponent's goal.
4. **Bludger Interactions**: The function `func_2` only handles player eliminations due to Bludger hits. It does not handle the scenario where a player is eliminated while carrying the Quaffle.

Given the incomplete nature of the functions and the missing logic for key aspects of the game, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not fully implement the rules and logic required to correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it lacks the necessary logic to handle the full set of rules and interactions described in the problem statement.
