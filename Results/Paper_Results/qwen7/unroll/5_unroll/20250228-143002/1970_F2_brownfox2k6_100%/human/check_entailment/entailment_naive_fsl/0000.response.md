Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not seem to handle the entire problem description correctly. Specifically, the function `func_1` appears to be designed to move an object on a 2D grid, but it does not account for the constraints and rules of the game described in the problem. For instance, the function does not check if the movement is within the bounds of the field (N x M), nor does it handle the special conditions related to players, balls, and Bludgers as described.

The function `func_2` is intended to eliminate players when they are hit by a Bludger. However, it does not update the state of the game properly. It simply prints the elimination message and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`, which does not reflect the actual state of the game. Additionally, the function does not handle the scenario where multiple players are hit simultaneously and need to be printed in alphabetical order.

Given these issues, the program does not fully implement the rules and logic required to correctly simulate the game as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
