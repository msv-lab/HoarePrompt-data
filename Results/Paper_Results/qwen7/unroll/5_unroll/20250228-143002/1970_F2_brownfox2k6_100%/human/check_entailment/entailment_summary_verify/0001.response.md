### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an entity based on the direction (`d`). It handles the four possible directions (`U`, `D`, `L`, `R`) appropriately by modifying the coordinates accordingly.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated by updating their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
   - It then prints a message for each eliminated player in alphabetical order using `sorted(out)`, ensuring the output is in the required format.

3. **Overall Program Logic**:
   - The original assessment correctly points out that the program logic for handling the main game events (scoring, catching, throwing, etc.) is missing.
   - The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their specific tasks but do not cover the entire game logic.
   - The program needs to:
     - Process the game steps.
     - Update the positions of players and balls.
     - Check for scoring events.
     - Handle eliminations based on Bludger interactions.
     - Print the appropriate output events in the correct order.

However, the original assessment concludes that the provided functions alone do not form a complete solution. While this conclusion is accurate, the assessment itself does not provide a detailed breakdown of why the functions are correct for their tasks. Let's re-evaluate the correctness of the functions and the overall program logic.

- **Function `func_1`**: Correctly updates the position based on the direction.
- **Function `func_2`**: Correctly identifies and eliminates players based on Bludger interactions.

Given that the functions are correct for their intended purposes, the issue lies with the overall program structure and logic, which is not provided in the given code.

### Conclusion:

- The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct for their respective tasks.
- The overall program logic is missing, but the functions themselves are correct.

### Correctness:
**True** for the correctness of the individual functions, but the overall program logic is incomplete.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The final evaluation is **False** because the overall program logic is missing, even though the provided functions are correct for their tasks.
