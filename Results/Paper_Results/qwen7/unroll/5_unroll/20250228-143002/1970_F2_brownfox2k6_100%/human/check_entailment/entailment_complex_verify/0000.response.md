### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program against the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` correctly updates the position of an object (player or ball) based on the direction of movement. It handles the four possible directions: 'U' (up), 'D' (down), 'L' (left), and 'R' (right).
- It does not enforce boundary conditions (i.e., ensuring the position stays within the field boundaries), but this is not a critical issue for the correctness of the logic itself. The main concern would be if the function were called with invalid positions, but the input validation ensures valid positions.

#### Function `func_2`:
- The function `func_2` is responsible for eliminating players when they are hit by a Bludger.
- It correctly identifies players whose positions match the Bludger's position and updates their positions to `[-1, -1]`.
- It prints the elimination messages in the correct format and ensures that the players are sorted alphabetically before printing.

#### Main Program Logic:
- The main program correctly processes the input and initializes the game state.
- It iterates through each action in the game, updating the positions of players and balls, and handling the scoring and elimination logic.
- The scoring logic correctly increments the score for the appropriate team when a player successfully scores.
- The elimination logic correctly identifies and prints the eliminated players.

#### Key Points:
- The program correctly handles the movement of players and balls.
- It correctly identifies and prints the elimination of players when they are hit by a Bludger.
- The scoring logic is implemented correctly, and the final score is printed at the end of the game.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the rules and logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment was overly critical and missed some of the correct aspects of the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the annotated code.
