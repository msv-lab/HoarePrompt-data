The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `obj`, which is a list of two integers representing a position on the field (row, column), and `d`, which is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). Based on the direction `d`, the function will either move up ('U'), down ('D'), left ('L'), or right ('R') from the given position `obj`. The functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a position on a field and a direction of movement, then return the new position after moving in the specified direction.
