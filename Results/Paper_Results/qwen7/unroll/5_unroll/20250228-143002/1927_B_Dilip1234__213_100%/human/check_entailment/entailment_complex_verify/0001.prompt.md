You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp lost the string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters,
but he still has its trace.

The trace of the string s is an array a of n integers, where a_i is the number
of such indices j (j < i ) that s_i=s_j . For example, the trace of the string
abracadabra is the array [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 1, 4 ].

Given a trace of a string, find any string s from which it could have been
obtained. The string s should consist only of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the lost string.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i < n ) — the trace of the string. It is guaranteed that for the given
trace, there exists a suitable string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a string s that corresponds to the given trace. If
there are multiple such strings s , then output any of them.

The string s should consist of lowercase Latin letters a-z.

It is guaranteed that for each test case, a valid answer exists.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())

    print(func_1(n, a))

- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i (0 <= a_i < n) represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string.
def func_1(n, a):
    s = ''
    char_count = [0] * 26
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(26):
            if char_count[j] == a[i]:
                s += chr(j + ord('a'))
                char_count[j] += 1
                break
        
    #State: Output State: `char_count` is a list of 26 integers, each increased by the corresponding value in the list `a`. The string `s` contains characters from 'a' to 'z' based on the values in `a`, with each character appearing a number of times equal to its corresponding value in `a`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` containing characters from 'a' to 'z', where each character appears a number of times equal to its corresponding value in the list `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n`. It constructs a string `s` containing characters from 'a' to 'z', where each character appears a number of times equal to its corresponding value in the list `a`. After executing the function, the program returns the string `s`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the trace array `a`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function takes `n` and `a` as inputs.
   - It initializes an empty string `s` and a list `char_count` to keep track of the count of each character used so far.

3. **Building the String `s`:**
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the program iterates through each character (from 'a' to 'z') represented by `j` (where `j` ranges from 0 to 25).
   - If the count of the current character `j` matches the value at `a[i]`, it appends the corresponding character to `s` and increments the count for that character in `char_count`.

### Verification:

1. **Trace Array Construction:**
   - The trace array `a` is constructed such that `a[i]` represents the number of previous indices `j` (where `j < i`) such that `s[i] = s[j]`.
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that characters are added to `s` in a way that respects this condition.

2. **Character Counting:**
   - The `char_count` list keeps track of how many times each character has been used so far.
   - When a character is added to `s`, its count is incremented, ensuring that the next time the same character is needed, it will be added correctly according to the trace.

3. **Guaranteed Validity:**
   - Since the problem guarantees that a valid string `s` exists for the given trace, and the algorithm constructs the string by always choosing the next available character that fits the trace, the solution is valid.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to construct a string `s` from its trace `a`. The approach ensures that the conditions specified in the problem statement are met.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
