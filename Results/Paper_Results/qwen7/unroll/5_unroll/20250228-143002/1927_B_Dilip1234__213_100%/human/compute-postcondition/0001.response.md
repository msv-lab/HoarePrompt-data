Output State: **`char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `s` is an empty string, n is a positive integer representing the length of the string, and a is a list of non-negative integers of length n, where each element a_i (0 <= a_i < n) represents the number of previous indices with the same character in the string.**

Explanation: The code initializes `char_count` as a list of 26 zeros. This means that initially, there are no counts for any of the 26 lowercase English letters in the string `s`. The variables `s` and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states.
