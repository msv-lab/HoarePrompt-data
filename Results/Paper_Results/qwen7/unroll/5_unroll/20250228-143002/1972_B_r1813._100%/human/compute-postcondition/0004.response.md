Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The only object in the loop head is `_` (a placeholder variable) and `t` (which is used as the range parameter).

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, the value of `t` must be at least 1 because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the given number. Therefore, if `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider the other given states**: The states of `n`, `s`, and `index` do not affect whether the loop executes. They are not part of the loop head.

4. **Formulate the final state**: The only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
