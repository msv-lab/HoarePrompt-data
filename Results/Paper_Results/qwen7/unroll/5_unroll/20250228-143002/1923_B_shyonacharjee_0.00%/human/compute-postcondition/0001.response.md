State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `_` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The variable `_` is a placeholder used in the loop and is automatically incremented with each iteration. It does not need to be explicitly set before the loop; its initial value is 0 when the loop starts.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.
