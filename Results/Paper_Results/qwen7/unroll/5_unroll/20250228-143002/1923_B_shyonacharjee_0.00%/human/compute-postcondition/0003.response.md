Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case based on whether it's possible to defeat all monsters given the constraints. For each test case, 'YES' is printed if the total number of bullets used does not exceed the available time for all monsters, otherwise 'NO' is printed.
