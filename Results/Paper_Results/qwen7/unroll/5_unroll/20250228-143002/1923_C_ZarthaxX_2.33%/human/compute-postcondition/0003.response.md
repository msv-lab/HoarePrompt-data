Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros, `sum` is a list of n+1 zeros where each element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `sum` with `n + 1` elements, where each element is set to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
