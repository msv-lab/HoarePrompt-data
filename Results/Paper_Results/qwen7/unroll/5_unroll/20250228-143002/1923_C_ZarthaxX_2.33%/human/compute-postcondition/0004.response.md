Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.
2. **Determine the Range of the Loop**: The loop runs from `1` to `n + 1` (inclusive), meaning `i` will take values from `1` to `n + 1` during the loop execution.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is initialized to `1` at the beginning of the loop.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer.
- `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `nums`.
- `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries.
- `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer.
- `ones` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.
- `sum` is a list of `n + 1` zeros where each element is `0`.

Since the loop only depends on the variable `i`, and `i` needs to be initialized to `1`, we do not need to adjust the states of `t`, `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, or `sum`. The only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`.

**State:**
**`i` is 1**
