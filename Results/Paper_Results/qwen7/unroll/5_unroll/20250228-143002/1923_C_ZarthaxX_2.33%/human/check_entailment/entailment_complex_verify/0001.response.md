### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step by step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `nums`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, which are used to store cumulative counts and sums respectively.
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements up to index `i-1` minus the count of 1s.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - It checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) simplifies to \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}\).
   - This condition checks if the number of 1s plus the remaining elements in the subarray can form a good array.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by printing "NO".
   - The cumulative count and sum calculations are correct and help in determining the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray.

3. **General Case:**
   - The logic in the loop correctly checks the condition for each query.
   - The use of cumulative counts and sums helps in efficiently calculating the required values for each query.

### Edge Case Consideration:

- **Subarray with All Elements Equal to 1:**
  - If the subarray consists entirely of 1s, the condition \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}\) will always be false because \(\text{sumInRange}\) will be zero (since each element is 1 and we subtract the index, resulting in a negative sum).

- **Subarray with Mixed Values:**
  - For a mixed subarray, the condition needs to check if the number of 1s plus the remaining elements can form a good array. The program correctly implements this by using the cumulative counts and sums.

### Example Verification:

Given the example input:
```
1
5 4
1 2 1 4 5
1 5
4 4
3 4
1 3
```

- **Query 1: `1 5`**
  - Subarray: `[1, 2, 1, 4, 5]`
  - `onesInRange = 3` (three 1s)
  - `sumInRange = 1 + 2 - 1 + 1 + 4 - 1 + 5 - 1 = 10`
  - Condition: \(3 + 5 \leq 10\) (True) -> Prints "YES"

- **Query 2: `4 4`**
  - Subarray: `[4]`
  - `onesInRange = 0` (no 1s)
  - `sumInRange = 4 - 1 = 3`
  - Condition: \(0 + 1 \leq 3\) (True) -> Prints "NO" (since `l == r`)

- **Query 3: `3 4`**
  - Subarray: `[1, 4, 5]`
  - `onesInRange = 1` (one 1)
  - `sumInRange = 1 + 4 - 1 + 5 - 1 = 8`
  - Condition: \(1 + 3 \leq 8\) (True) -> Prints "YES"

- **Query 4: `1 3`**
  - Subarray: `[1, 2, 1]`
  - `onesInRange = 2` (two 1s)
  - `sumInRange = 1 + 2 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 2`
  - Condition: \(2 + 3 \leq 2\) (False) -> Prints "NO"

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The condition checks and edge cases are handled appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**
