Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `q`, followed by the array `nums`.
   - It then processes `q` queries.

2. **Initialization:**
   - The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, which are used to store cumulative counts and sums respectively.
   - `ones[i]` stores the count of 1s up to index `i-1`.
   - `sum[i]` stores the sum of elements up to index `i-1` minus the count of 1s.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it reads the indices `l` and `r`.
   - If `l == r`, the subarray has only one element, so it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of 1s (`onesInRange`) and the sum of the subarray (`sumInRange`).
   - It checks if the condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) holds.
   - If the condition is true, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check:

1. **Condition Analysis:**
   - The condition \(2 \times \text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) - \text{onesInRange} \leq \text{sumInRange}\) simplifies to \(\text{onesInRange} + (r - l + 1) \leq \text{sumInRange}\).
   - This condition is checking whether the number of 1s plus the remaining elements in the subarray can form a good array.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `l == r` by printing "NO".
   - The cumulative count and sum calculations are correct and help in determining the number of 1s and the sum of the subarray.

3. **General Case:**
   - The logic in the loop correctly checks the condition for each query.
   - The use of cumulative counts and sums helps in efficiently calculating the required values for each query.

### Conclusion:

After analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately. The program correctly identifies whether a subarray is good based on the given conditions.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
