Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer representing the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of n+1 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `ones` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, and `nums` remain unchanged from their initial states.
