Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is the length of the array `nums`, `q` is an input integer representing the number of subarray queries, `nums` is a list of integers created by splitting the input string on spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element represents the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to that index minus the index itself, after executing all the iterations of the loop, for each query `(l, r)`, a 'YES' or 'NO' has been printed based on the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.
