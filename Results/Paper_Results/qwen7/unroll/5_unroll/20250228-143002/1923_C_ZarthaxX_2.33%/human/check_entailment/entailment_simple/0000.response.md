### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining whether a subarray of the given array `c` is "good" based on specific conditions. A subarray is considered "good" if it meets the criteria outlined in the problem statement.

2. **Function Breakdown**:
   - The function `func_1()` processes each test case.
   - It reads `n` and `q` for each test case.
   - It reads the array `nums` of length `n`.
   - It calculates two auxiliary arrays: `ones` and `sum`.
     - `ones[i]` stores the cumulative count of 1s up to index `i-1` in `nums`.
     - `sum[i]` stores the cumulative sum of elements in `nums` up to index `i-1` minus the index itself.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray from `l` to `r` is "good" using the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange`.

3. **Condition Analysis**:
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` simplifies to `onesInRange + (r - l + 1) <= sumInRange`.
   - This condition ensures that the subarray can be transformed into another array `b` where:
     - The sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
     - No element in the subarray is the same in `a` and `b`.
     - All elements in `b` are positive.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `l == r`, the subarray is invalid, so it prints "NO".
   - The condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` correctly identifies whether the subarray can be transformed as required.

5. **Output**:
   - The function correctly prints "YES" or "NO" for each query based on the derived condition.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is "good" based on the given conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
