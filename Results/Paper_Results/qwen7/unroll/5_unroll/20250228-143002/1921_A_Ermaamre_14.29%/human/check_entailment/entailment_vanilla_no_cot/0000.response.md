Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square. The logic in the program only considers three specific cases where the x-coordinates of the corners are compared, which is insufficient to cover all possible configurations of the square's corners. 

To correctly solve this problem, you need to identify the pairs of points that form the sides of the square and then calculate the distance between these points. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the side length of the square
        distances = [
            ((points[0][0] - points[1][0]) ** 2 + (points[0][1] - points[1][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5,
            ((points[0][0] - points[2][0]) ** 2 + (points[0][1] - points[2][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5,
            ((points[0][0] - points[3][0]) ** 2 + (points[0][1] - points[3][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5,
            ((points[1][0] - points[2][0]) ** 2 + (points[1][1] - points[2][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5,
            ((points[1][0] - points[3][0]) ** 2 + (points[1][1] - points[3][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5,
            ((points[2][0] - points[3][0]) ** 2 + (points[2][1] - points[3][1]) ** 2) ** 0.5
        ]
        
        # The side length should be the smallest non-zero distance
        side_length = min(distances)
        
        # Calculate the area of the square
        area = side_length ** 2
        print(area)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that all possible pairs of points are considered to find the side length of the square, which is necessary to handle any configuration of the square's corners.
