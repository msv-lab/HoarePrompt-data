You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of n and m, both positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500, and a grid of size n × m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. The sum of n × m over all test cases does not exceed 3 × 10^5.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if the entire first and last rows of the grid are uniform but different from each other, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n × m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, it checks if the first and last rows are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if the entire first and last rows of the grid are uniform but different from each other. If either condition is met, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, each representing a row of the grid, storing these rows in a list `a`.

2. **Extracting Rows:**
   - The first row (`first_row`) and the last row (`last_row`) are extracted from the list `a`.
   - This is done by concatenating the first character of each row to form `first_row` and the last character of each row to form `last_row`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks two conditions:
     1. If the first row and the last row are different but both consist of the same color (i.e., `len(set(a[0])) == 1` and `a[0] != a[-1]`).
     2. If the first column and the last column are different but both consist of the same color (i.e., `len(set(first_row)) == 1` and `first_row != last_row`).

4. **Output:**
   - If either of the above conditions is true, the program prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

#### Condition 1: Checking First and Last Rows
- The condition `len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]` checks if the first and last rows are different but both are of the same color.
- However, this condition does not cover all scenarios where the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, consider a grid where the first and last rows are different but the rest of the grid is uniform. The program would incorrectly identify such a grid as non-uniform.

#### Condition 2: Checking First and Last Columns
- The condition `len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row` checks if the first and last columns are different but both are of the same color.
- Similar to the first condition, this does not cover all scenarios where the entire grid can be made uniform.

### Counterexample
Consider the following grid:
```
W B W B
B W B W
W B W B
B W B W
```

- The first row is `W B W B`.
- The last row is `B W B W`.
- The first column is `W B W B`.
- The last column is `B W B W`.

- Both the first and last rows are different, but they are not uniform.
- Both the first and last columns are different, but they are not uniform.

The program would incorrectly print "NO" for this grid because neither the first and last rows nor the first and last columns are uniform.

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify grids that can be made uniform using the allowed operations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
