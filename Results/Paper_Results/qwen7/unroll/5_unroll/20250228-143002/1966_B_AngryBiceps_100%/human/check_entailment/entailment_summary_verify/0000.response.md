### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given examples.

#### Problem Description and Requirements:
- The goal is to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the specified operations.
- The program should check if it is possible to make all squares the same color, regardless of the initial configuration of the grid.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if the first and last rows are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if the entire first and last rows of the grid are uniform but different from each other.
- If either condition is met, it outputs 'NO'; otherwise, it outputs 'YES'.

#### Analysis:
1. **First and Last Rows Check**:
   - The program checks if the first and last rows are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'). This is a necessary but not sufficient condition for making all squares the same color.
   - The program also checks if the first and last rows are different but uniform. This is another necessary but not sufficient condition.

2. **Counterexamples**:
   - **Example 1**: `3 3
     BBB
     BBB
     BBB`
     - All squares are already the same color, so the correct output should be "YES".
     - The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because the first and last rows are identical.

   - **Example 2**: `3 3
     BBB
     WBB
     BBB`
     - It is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the operations described in the problem statement.
     - The program incorrectly outputs "NO" because the first and last rows are not identical and not different but uniform.

3. **Correctness**:
   - The program fails to handle cases where the grid can be made uniform through operations but the first and last rows do not meet the specific conditions checked by the program.

Given the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
