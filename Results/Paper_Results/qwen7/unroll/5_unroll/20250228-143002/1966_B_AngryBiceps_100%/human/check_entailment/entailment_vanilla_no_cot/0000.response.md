Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Here’s why:

1. **First and Last Rows Check**: The code checks if the first and last rows are different and if they contain only one unique color. This is not sufficient to determine if the entire grid can be made uniform. For example, consider a grid where the first row is `WW` and the last row is `BB`, but the middle rows have mixed colors. The current logic would incorrectly return "NO".

2. **General Grid Check**: The solution does not check if the entire grid can be made uniform by performing the allowed operations. It only checks the first and last rows and columns, which is insufficient.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if the grid can be made uniform by ensuring that all rows or all columns are the same. Here’s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_same = True
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i] != a[0]:
                all_rows_same = False
                break
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_cols_same = True
        for j in range(m):
            col = ''.join([a[i][j] for i in range(n)])
            if col != a[0][j]:
                all_cols_same = False
                break
        
        if all_rows_same or all_cols_same:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Reading Input**: The grid is read into a list of strings.
2. **Checking Rows**: Iterate through the rows to check if all rows are the same.
3. **Checking Columns**: Iterate through the columns to check if all columns are the same.
4. **Output**: If either all rows or all columns are the same, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

This approach ensures that the solution correctly determines whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color.
