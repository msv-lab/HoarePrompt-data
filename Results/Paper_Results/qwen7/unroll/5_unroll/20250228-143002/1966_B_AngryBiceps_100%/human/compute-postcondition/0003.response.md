Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n × m where n and m are positive integers (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500) and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), it evaluates the grid and returns a result based on specific criteria.**

Note: The actual criteria for returning a result are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the input structure and processing of the grid.
