Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last rows and columns to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, which is not a sufficient condition.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

```
3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB
```

In this case, all squares are already the same color ('B'), so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program would not detect this correctly because it only checks the first and last rows/columns.

Another counterexample is:

```
3 3
BBB
WBB
BBB
```

Here, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the operations described in the problem statement. However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO" because the first and last rows/columns do not meet the conditions it checks.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and is thus incorrect.
