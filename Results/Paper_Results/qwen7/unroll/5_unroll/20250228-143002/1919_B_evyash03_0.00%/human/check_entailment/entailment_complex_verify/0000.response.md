### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine if it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `+` and `-`.
- Convert `s` into an array `a` where `a_i = 1` if `s_i = '+'` and `a_i = -1` if `s_i = '-'`.
- Split `a` into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
- The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The goal is to find the minimum possible penalty.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the string `expression`.

2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts based on the `'-'` character using `parts = expression.split('-')`.
   - This step is not directly related to the optimal splitting of the array `a` but rather simplifies the string into segments.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes the string `expression` and the length `length` of the string.
   - It initializes `count` and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in `expression`:
     - If the character is `'+'`, `balance` is incremented.
     - If the character is `'-'`, `balance` is decremented.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, `count` is incremented, and `balance` is reset to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

#### Key Issues:
- The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal way to split the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty.
- The function simply counts the number of times the balance goes negative and adds 1 if the final balance is positive, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The expected output is `4`, as the optimal split would be `([--], [++++++], [-])` with penalties `4 + 0 + 0 = 4`.
- However, the program would incorrectly output `1` because it counts the number of times the balance goes negative, which is once (`balance` goes from 0 to -2).

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum possible penalty. The function `func_1` does not consider the optimal splitting of the array `a` into subarrays to minimize the total penalty. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
