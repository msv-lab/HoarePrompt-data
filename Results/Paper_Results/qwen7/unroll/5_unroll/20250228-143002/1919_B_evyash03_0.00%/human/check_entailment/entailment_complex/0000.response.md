Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty for splitting the array \(a\) derived from the string \(s\).
2. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of times the balance becomes negative during the iteration through the string \(s\). This count represents the optimal number of splits needed to minimize the penalty.
3. The function `func_1` iterates through the string `expression`, maintaining a balance that increases with '+' and decreases with '-'. When the balance becomes negative, it increments the count and resets the balance to 0. After the loop, if the balance is positive, it increments the count by 1.
4. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance becomes negative, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.
5. The correct approach would involve splitting the array at points where the balance changes sign, ensuring that each segment has a sum of either all '+' or all '-', thus minimizing the penalty.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. Therefore, the function `func_1` is incorrect for solving the given problem.

Correctness: **False**
