Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `T` (1 ≤ T ≤ 20,000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes another positive integer `S` and a list `N` of `n` non-negative integers (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, 0 ≤ a_i < n). It sorts the list `N` and then determines the maximum value `cur` such that there are no gaps in the sequence from 0 to `cur-1`. If no such `cur` exists, it sets `cur` to the largest number satisfying the conditions. Finally, it prints the value of `cur` for each test case.**
