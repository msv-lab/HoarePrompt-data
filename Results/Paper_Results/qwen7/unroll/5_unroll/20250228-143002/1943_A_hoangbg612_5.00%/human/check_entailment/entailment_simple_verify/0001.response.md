### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the annotated code against the requirements:

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array `N` is unnecessary for determining the MEX and does not affect the game logic. This step can be removed without impacting the correctness of the solution.

2. **Initialization and Dictionary Usage:**
   - The initialization of `cur` to -1 and the use of the dictionary `M` to count occurrences of numbers in `N` are not aligned with the game rules. The dictionary `M` should track the numbers that Alice and Bob have chosen, not just their counts.

3. **Processing the Array:**
   - The logic inside the loop to update `cur` and `M` does not correctly simulate the game's turns. Alice can pick any element from `a`, and Bob removes elements without appending them to `c`. The current logic does not reflect these rules.

4. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - The final calculation to find the smallest missing number in `M` is incorrect. The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob properly. Instead, it tries to find the smallest missing number in the sorted array, which is not equivalent to the MEX of the array `c` formed by Alice's choices.

### Correct Approach:

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game's turns and keep track of the numbers chosen by Alice and Bob. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Initialize the set to keep track of chosen numbers
        chosen_numbers = set()

        # Alice's turn
        for _ in range(S // 2):
            chosen_numbers.add(N.pop(0))

        # Bob's turn
        for _ in range(S // 2):
            N.pop(0)

        # Determine the MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in chosen_numbers:
            mex += 1

        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - Read the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, read the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Initialize Chosen Numbers Set:**
   - Use a set `chosen_numbers` to keep track of the numbers chosen by Alice.

3. **Alice's Turn:**
   - Alice picks one element from `a` and appends it to `c`. We simulate this by popping elements from the front of the list `N` and adding them to `chosen_numbers`.

4. **Bob's Turn:**
   - Bob picks one element from `a` and removes it. We simulate this by simply popping elements from the front of the list `N`.

5. **Determine MEX:**
   - Start from 0 and increment until we find the smallest number not in `chosen_numbers`.

### Conclusion:

The original program does not correctly simulate the game's turns and does not compute the MEX accurately. The corrected program simulates the game correctly and computes the MEX as required.

**Final: False**
