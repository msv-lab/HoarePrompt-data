Reasoning:
1. The provided solution correctly initializes the permutation list `p` with `-1` values.
2. It iterates through the indices of `a` in reverse order, starting from `n-1` down to `0`.
3. For each index `i`, it sets `p[i]` to `mex - a[i]` and updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and `p[i]`. This ensures that `mex` always represents the smallest non-negative integer not yet used in `p`.
4. The logic for calculating `p` based on the MEX condition is correct and follows the problem statement.
5. The solution handles multiple test cases as expected, reading `t` test cases and processing each one individually.
6. The output format matches the problem requirements, printing the permutation `p` for each test case.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find a valid permutation `p` for each test case based on the given array `a`.

Correctness: **True**
