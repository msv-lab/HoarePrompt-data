Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating backward through the array `a` and calculating the permutation `p`. However, the logic used to calculate `p[i]` might not correctly reflect the definition of MEX as it stands. Specifically, the current implementation sets `p[i] = mex - a[i]` and then updates `mex` to be the minimum of `mex` and `p[i]`. This approach does not guarantee that the MEX condition is met for each step because `mex` is updated after setting `p[i]`, which could lead to incorrect values for subsequent indices.

To properly solve this problem, we need to ensure that for each index `i`, `p[i]` is set to the MEX value minus `a[i]`, and we must ensure that the MEX value is correctly maintained throughout the process. A correct approach would involve maintaining a set of seen values and calculating the MEX dynamically as needed.

Given the current logic, the program might produce incorrect results for some test cases. Therefore, the provided solution is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
