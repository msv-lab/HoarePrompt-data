Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads the size `n` and the array `a` for each test case, which matches the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**: The permutation `p` is initialized with `-1` for each index, which is a common approach to mark unassigned positions.

3. **Calculation of MEX**: The program calculates the MEX value for each position in reverse order. This is a critical part of the solution because it ensures that the smallest unused number is assigned correctly. The MEX value is updated after assigning `p[i]`.

4. **Output**: The program prints the permutation `p` for each test case, which is the required output format.

5. **Logic Consistency**: The logic used to calculate `p[i] = mex - a[i]` and update `mex` afterward is consistent with the definition of MEX. The reverse iteration ensures that the smallest available number is chosen for each position.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement, ensuring that at least one valid permutation exists and that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
