Output State: **number is a positive integer; sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9]; the function returns the size of the generated sequence.**

The given code is a docstring for a function that generates a sequence of numbers based on an input number. However, the actual implementation of the function is not provided. Therefore, the only information we can deduce from the code is that the function will return the size of the generated sequence. The initial values of `number` and the properties of `sequence` remain unchanged.
