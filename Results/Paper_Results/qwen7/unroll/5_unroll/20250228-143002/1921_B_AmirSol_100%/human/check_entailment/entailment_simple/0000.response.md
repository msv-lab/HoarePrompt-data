Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`). Here's how the logic works:

1. **Count Cats to Add**: The variable `cats_to_add` counts the number of positions where there is no cat initially (`s1[i] == '0'`) but there should be one in the desired state (`s2[i] == '1'`).
2. **Count Cats to Remove**: The variable `cats_to_remove` counts the number of positions where there is a cat initially (`s1[i] == '1'`) but there should not be one in the desired state (`s2[i] == '0'`).

The minimum number of operations needed to achieve the desired state is the maximum of these two counts. This is because:
- To add a cat where there is none, we need at least one operation.
- To remove a cat where there is one, we need at least one operation.
- To move a cat from one box to another, we can consider it as one removal and one addition, thus still contributing to the maximum count.

Given this logic, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required. Therefore, the annotated program is logically sound and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
