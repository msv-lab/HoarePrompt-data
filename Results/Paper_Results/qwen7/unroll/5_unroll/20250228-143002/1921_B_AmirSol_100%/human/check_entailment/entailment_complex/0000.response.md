Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (`s1`) to the desired state (`s2`). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of boxes (`n`), the initial state (`s1`), and the desired state (`s2`).

2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1` calculates the number of cats that need to be added and removed to achieve the desired state.
   - `cats_to_add` counts the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'. This represents the number of cats that need to be added.
   - `cats_to_remove` counts the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'. This represents the number of cats that need to be removed.
   - The function returns the maximum of these two values, which correctly accounts for the minimum number of operations needed. This is because moving a cat from one box to another or removing a cat from a box both count as one operation.

3. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the result returned by `func_1`.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the function correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state to the desired state. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
