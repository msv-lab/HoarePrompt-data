Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, it does not read the input array `a` correctly and does not perform the operations to maximize the sum of the array elements as described. Instead, it hardcodes the results for specific input lengths without actually processing the input data. This means it will not work for general cases where the input array length is not 2 or 1, and it does not provide a way to calculate the MEX value or perform the operations needed to maximize the sum of the array elements.
