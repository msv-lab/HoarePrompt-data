You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Nene gave you an array of integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n of length n .

You can perform the following operation no more than 5\cdot 10^5 times
(possibly zero):

  * Choose two integers l and r such that 1 \le l \le r \le n , compute x as \operatorname{MEX}(\\{a_l, a_{l+1}, \ldots, a_r\\}) , and simultaneously set a_l:=x, a_{l+1}:=x, \ldots, a_r:=x . 

Here, \operatorname{MEX} of a set of integers \\{c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k\\} is
defined as the smallest non-negative integer m which does not occur in the set
c .

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the elements of the array a . Find the
maximum sum and construct a sequence of operations that achieves this sum.
Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations in this
sequence, you only should use no more than 5\cdot 10^5 operations in your
solution.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 18 ) — the length of the
array a .

The second line contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n (0\leq a_i \leq 10^7 )
— the array a .

Output

In the first line, output two integers s and m (0\le m\le 5\cdot 10^5 ) — the
maximum sum of elements of the array a and the number of operations in your
solution.

In the i -th of the following m lines, output two integers l and r (1 \le l
\le r \le n ), representing the parameters of the i -th operation.

It can be shown that the maximum sum of elements of the array a can always be
obtained in no more than 5 \cdot 10^5 operations.

Note

In the first example, after the operation with l=1 and r=2 the array a becomes
equal to [2,2] . It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum
of the elements of a , so the answer is 4 .

In the second example, the initial sum of elements is 13 which can be shown to
be the largest.

In the third example, the array a changes as follows:

  * after the first operation (l=3 , r=3 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,0,1] ; 
  * after the second operation (l=3 , r=4 ), the array a becomes equal to [1,100,2,2] . 

It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a larger sum of the elements
of a , so the answer is 105 .

- Program: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if c == 2:
        print(f'4 1')
        print(f'1 2')
    else:
        print(f'13 0')
    return



- Annotated Code: 
a = []
n = int(input())
sa = input()
na = sa.split()
for ai in na:
    a.append(ai)
func_1(len(a))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: c is a list of integers where the length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each element a_i of the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7.
def func_1(c):
    m = 0
    if (c == 2) :
        print(f'4 1')
        #This is printed: 4 1
        print(f'1 2')
        #This is printed: 1 2
    else :
        print(f'13 0')
        #This is printed: 13 0
    #State: Postcondition: `c` is a list of integers where the length of the list n satisfies 1 ≤ n ≤ 18, and each element a_i of the list satisfies 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7; `m` is 0, and the list `c` either equals 2 or does not equal 2.
    return
    #The program returns 0



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the length `n` of the array and then reads `n` integers into the list `a`.

2. **Function Definition:**
   - The function `func_1(c)` is defined but never called with the actual length of the array `n`. This function is not used in the main logic of the program.

3. **Handling Different Cases:**
   - The program checks if the length of the array `c` is 2 and prints a specific output for this case.
   - For all other lengths, it prints a different output.

4. **Problem-Specific Logic:**
   - The problem requires finding the maximum sum of the array by performing operations to set subarrays to their MEX values.
   - The given solution does not implement any logic to find the MEX value or perform the operations to maximize the sum.

### Correctness Check:

- **Case 1: Array Length 2**
  - Given input: `0 1`
  - Expected output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`
  - Actual output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`
  - This part seems correct for the specific test case provided.

- **Case 2: Array Length 3**
  - Given input: `1 3 9`
  - Expected output: `13 0`
  - Actual output: `13 0`
  - This part is also correct for the specific test case provided.

- **Case 3: Array Length 4**
  - Given input: `1 100 2 1`
  - Expected output: `105 2` followed by `3 3` and `3 4`
  - Actual output: `105 2` followed by `3 3` and `3 4`
  - This part is correct for the specific test case provided.

- **General Case:**
  - The program does not handle general cases where the array length is greater than 2 or less than 2.
  - It does not implement the logic to find the MEX value or perform the required operations to maximize the sum.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem for general cases. It only handles specific test cases (lengths 2, 3, and 4) and does not provide a general solution. Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

**Correctness: **False**
