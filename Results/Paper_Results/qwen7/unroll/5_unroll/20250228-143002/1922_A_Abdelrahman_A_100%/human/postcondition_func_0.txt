Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, each involving three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are each of length \(n\) (with \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)), and \(c\) is also of length \(n\). For each test case, the function checks if \(c\) contains any character not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) contains any such character, it outputs 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in \(c\) is present in the corresponding positions in \(a\) and \(b\). If any character in \(c\) is not found in both \(a\) and \(b\), it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses, one for each test case.
