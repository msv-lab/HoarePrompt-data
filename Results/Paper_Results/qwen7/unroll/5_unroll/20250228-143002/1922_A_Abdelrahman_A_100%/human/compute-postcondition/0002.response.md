Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the loop for each iteration. For each test case (determined by the value of `tests`), the program checks if character `c` can be formed using characters from strings `a` and `b`. If `c` matches `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if each character in `c` exists in either `a` or `b` at the corresponding position; if all characters satisfy this condition, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The output will contain `tests` lines, each representing the result ('YES' or 'NO') for each test case.
