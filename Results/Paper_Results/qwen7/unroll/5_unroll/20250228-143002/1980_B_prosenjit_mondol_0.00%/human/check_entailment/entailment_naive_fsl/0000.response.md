Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider the scenario where the favorite cube is exactly at the k-th position after sorting but still gets removed because the next cube in the sorted list is equal to the value of the favorite cube. This can happen when `k` is not the last element, and the value of the cube at position `k` is equal to the value of the cube at position `k-1`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- After sorting, the list becomes `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`.
- The favorite cube (value 3) is at index 1, which corresponds to the second position.
- Since `k = 2`, the first two cubes are removed.
- The program incorrectly prints "NO" because it checks only if `a[k] > x` or `a[k] < x`, but it should also check if `a[k] == x` and `k` is not the last element.

To fix this, the program needs to check if the value of the cube at position `k` is equal to the value of the favorite cube and if `k` is not the last element before printing "YES".
