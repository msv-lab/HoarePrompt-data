Output State: The output state will consist of "YES" or "NO" printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided in the loop body. Specifically, for each input integer `n` and string `s`, the program checks the count of '1's in `s`. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 and even, it prints 'YES'. If the count of '1's is greater than 2 but odd, it prints 'NO'. If the count of '1's is exactly 1, it also prints 'NO'. If '11' appears in `s`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
