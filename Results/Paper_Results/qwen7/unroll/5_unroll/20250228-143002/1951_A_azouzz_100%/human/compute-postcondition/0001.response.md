State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t`, which is used as the range parameter in the for loop.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
3. The variables `start` and `end` are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to run at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be at least 1.
