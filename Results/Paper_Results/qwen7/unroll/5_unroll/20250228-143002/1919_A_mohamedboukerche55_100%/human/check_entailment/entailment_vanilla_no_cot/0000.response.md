Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic of the game. The key issue lies in the condition used to determine the winner. The logic in the given solution checks if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and based on that, it decides the winner. However, the actual winning condition is more complex and depends on the parity of the individual values of `a` and `b`.

Hereâ€™s the correct approach:

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, then Alice will always win because she can force Bob into a losing position by swapping wallets and reducing the number of coins in her wallet.
- If one of them is odd and the other is even, then Bob will win because he can force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and reducing the number of coins in her wallet.
- If both `a` and `b` are even, then Bob will win because he can force Alice into a losing position by swapping wallets and reducing the number of coins in her wallet.

Based on this, the correct implementation should be:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        if (a % 2 == 1 and b % 2 == 1):  # Both a and b are odd
            print('Alice')
        elif (a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0):  # Both a and b are even
            print('Bob')
        else:  # One is odd and the other is even
            print('Bob')

func()
```

This code correctly implements the logic based on the parity of `a` and `b`.
