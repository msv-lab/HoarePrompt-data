### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key insight that the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`) determines the winner. However, there are a few points to consider in the program's implementation and the reasoning provided:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program uses `list(s.split())[0]` and `list(s.split())[1]` to parse the input. This approach assumes that the input is always well-formed and contains exactly two space-separated integers. While this works for the given examples, it does not handle potential edge cases where the input might be malformed (e.g., extra spaces, non-integer values).

2. **Game Logic**:
   - The program correctly checks the parity of the total number of coins (`a + b`). If `a + b` is even, it prints 'Bob', and if `a + b` is odd, it prints 'Alice'. This aligns with the optimal strategy described in the original assessment.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - The original assessment correctly states that the parity of the total number of coins determines the winner. However, the detailed reasoning could be more explicit about why this is the case. Specifically, it should clarify that:
     - If `a + b` is even, Bob can always force the total to remain even, ensuring Alice eventually loses.
     - If `a + b` is odd, Alice can always force the total to become even, ensuring Bob eventually loses.

### Final Evaluation

Based on the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the total number of coins. The input parsing could be improved to handle edge cases, but the core logic is sound.

**Final: True**

The program is correct in determining the winner based on the given rules and logic.
