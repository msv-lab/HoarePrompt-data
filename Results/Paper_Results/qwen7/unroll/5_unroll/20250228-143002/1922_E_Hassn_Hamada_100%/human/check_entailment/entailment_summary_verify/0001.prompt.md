You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^18], and `sequence`, a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If `number` is 0, the function returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it generates a sequence of numbers based on `number` and appends these numbers to `sequence`. Finally, the function recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns (0, 0).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to build a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursion**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward through possible values, calculating the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the appropriate size and value for the current segment.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The recursion continues until the `number` is reduced to 0.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.
   - For other values of `X`, the sequence generation logic seems to be correctly implemented.

### Verification:
- The provided code appears to follow the logic needed to generate the required sequence.
- The recursive function `func_1` correctly builds the sequence based on the given `X`.
- The main loop correctly processes each test case and prints the results.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
