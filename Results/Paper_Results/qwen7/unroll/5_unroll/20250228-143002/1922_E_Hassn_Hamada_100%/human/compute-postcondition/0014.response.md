Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer within the range [2, 10^18], and `sequence`, a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]. If `number` is 0, the function returns (0, 0). Otherwise, it generates a sequence of numbers and modifies the `sequence` list accordingly. After processing, the function recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns (0, 0).
