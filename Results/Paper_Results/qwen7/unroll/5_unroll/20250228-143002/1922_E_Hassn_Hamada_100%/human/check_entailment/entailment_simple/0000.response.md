Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a recursive approach to construct such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - `func_1` is a recursive function that generates the sequence.
   - It starts by checking if `number` is zero, which would terminate the recursion.
   - For non-zero `number`, it calculates the size and value needed to add to the sequence.
   - It iterates backward from the maximum value in the current sequence to find the appropriate size and value.
   - Once a suitable size and value are found, it appends the necessary elements to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

3. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - The base case is when `number` is zero, which returns immediately.
   - The recursive case constructs the sequence by appending elements and reducing `number` accordingly.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending elements in a way that ensures the number of increasing subsequences matches the target `X`.
   - The use of bitwise operations helps in efficiently determining the elements to append.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The output is constructed correctly by printing the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself.
   - The constraints are handled appropriately, ensuring that the sequence length does not exceed 200.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where `number` is zero correctly by terminating the recursion.
   - It also handles large values of `X` by breaking out of the loop when the condition is met.

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
