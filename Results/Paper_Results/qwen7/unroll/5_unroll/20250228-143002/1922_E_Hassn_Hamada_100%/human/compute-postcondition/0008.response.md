Output State: **size is 1, overlap is 0**

Explanation: The code `size, overlap = size_overlap` unpacks the tuple `size_overlap` into two variables `size` and `overlap`. Given the initial state where `size_overlap` is `(1, 0)`, the values of `size` and `overlap` are directly assigned as 1 and 0 respectively. No other variables are affected, so the output state includes only these updated values.
