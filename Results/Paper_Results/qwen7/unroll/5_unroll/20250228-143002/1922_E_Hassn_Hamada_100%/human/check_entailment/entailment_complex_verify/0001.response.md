### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to build a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursion**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward through possible values, calculating the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the appropriate size and value for the current segment.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The recursion continues until the `number` is reduced to 0.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.
   - For other values of `X`, the sequence generation logic seems to be correctly implemented.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the recursive function `func_1`, there are issues with the logic used to generate the sequence. Specifically, the function does not correctly ensure that the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

### Detailed Issues:
1. **Incorrect Bit Manipulation Logic**:
   - The logic used to calculate the size and value of the segments of the sequence is flawed. The use of bitwise operations `(1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)` and the while loop condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` do not correctly determine the number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Overlapping Segments**:
   - The function attempts to handle overlapping segments using `overlap`, but the logic for determining the correct overlaps is incorrect. This leads to sequences that do not have the exact number of increasing subsequences as required.

3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls to `func_1` with updated parameters do not correctly reduce the `number` to match the desired number of increasing subsequences.

### Example Counterexample:
Consider `X = 5`. The expected output should be an array with exactly 5 increasing subsequences. However, the current implementation will produce a sequence that does not meet this requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the logic to generate a sequence with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified. The recursive function `func_1` does not accurately determine the sequence based on the given `X`.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate due to the logical errors in the recursive function `func_1`.
