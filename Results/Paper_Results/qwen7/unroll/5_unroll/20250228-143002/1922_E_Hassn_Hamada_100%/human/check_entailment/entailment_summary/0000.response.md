Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating an array such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by recursively generating a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
3. The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence that meets the criteria for a specific `number`. It uses bitwise operations to determine the appropriate sequence length and values.
4. The main loop in the program reads test cases and calls `func_1` to generate the required sequence for each test case.
5. The execution summary indicates that the function correctly generates sequences based on the input `number` using bitwise operations, which aligns with the logic needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.
6. The output format matches the requirements: the length of the array followed by the array elements.

Given the above points, the provided program appears to correctly implement the logic to generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **True**
