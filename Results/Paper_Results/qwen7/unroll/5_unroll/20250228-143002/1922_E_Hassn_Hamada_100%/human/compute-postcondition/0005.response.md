Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `-1`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is determined by `max(sequence, default=0)`. 

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop will start with `i` set to `max(sequence, default=0)` and will decrement until it reaches `-1`, we need to ensure that `i` starts with a value that allows the loop to execute at least once.

Given that `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, we need to consider the possible values of `sequence` that would allow the loop to start. If `sequence` is less than or equal to 0, then `max(sequence, default=0)` will be 0, and the loop will start with `i` as 0. If `sequence` is greater than 0, then `max(sequence, default=0)` will be `sequence`, and the loop will start with `i` as `sequence`.

Since we don't know the exact value of `sequence`, we need to ensure that `i` starts with a value that allows the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` must be greater than or equal to 0**
