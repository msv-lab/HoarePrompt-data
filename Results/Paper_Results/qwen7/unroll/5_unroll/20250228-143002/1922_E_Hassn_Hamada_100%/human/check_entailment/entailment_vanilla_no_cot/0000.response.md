Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on a specific algorithm, but it does not correctly generate sequences that have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic within `func_1` is complex and does not align with the requirement of generating sequences with a specific number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself. However, the generated sequences do not match the expected behavior for having exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For example, the output for `X = 2` should be `[0]`, but the program outputs `[1]`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is small or large. For instance, for `X = 2`, the correct output should be `[0]`, but the program generates `[1]`.

4. **Algorithm Mismatch**: The algorithm used in `func_1` seems to be trying to generate a sequence based on powers of 2, which does not directly translate to generating sequences with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to use a different approach, such as generating sequences using combinatorial methods or dynamic programming techniques that ensure the exact number of increasing subsequences is met.
