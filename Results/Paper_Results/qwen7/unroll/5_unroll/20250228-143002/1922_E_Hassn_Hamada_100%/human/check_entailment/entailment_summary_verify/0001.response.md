### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to find an array of integers with a specific number of increasing subsequences (`X`). The solution uses a recursive function `func_1` to generate such an array.

2. **Recursive Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to build a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - It uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence.
   - The goal is to construct a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`.

3. **Base Case and Recursion**:
   - If `number` is 0, the function returns immediately.
   - For non-zero `number`, it iterates backward through possible values, calculating the size and value of the next segment of the sequence.
   - It uses bitwise operations to determine the appropriate size and value for the current segment.

4. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is built by appending values based on the calculated size and overlap.
   - The recursion continues until the `number` is reduced to 0.

5. **Output Validation**:
   - The main loop reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.
   - For other values of `X`, the sequence generation logic seems to be correctly implemented.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `X` is 1 by printing `-1` since an array with exactly one increasing subsequence does not exist.
   - For other values of `X`, the sequence generation logic seems to be correctly implemented.

However, upon closer inspection of the function summary and the implementation details, there are a few issues that need to be addressed:

- **Function Summary Mismatch**: The function summary states that `func_1` returns a tuple `(size, value)`, but the actual implementation returns nothing and modifies the `sequence` list directly. This discrepancy means the function summary is misleading and does not accurately reflect the function's behavior.
  
- **Bit Manipulation Logic**: The bit manipulation logic used in `func_1` seems overly complex and may not always produce the correct sequence. Specifically, the use of bitwise operations to determine the size and value of the next segment might not always yield the correct increasing subsequence count.

- **Edge Case Handling**: While the code handles the case where `X` is 1 correctly by printing `-1`, it does not explicitly handle other edge cases where the generated sequence might not meet the exact requirement of `X` increasing subsequences.

Given these issues, the original assessment overestimates the correctness of the code. The function summary and the implementation do not align, and the bit manipulation logic might not always produce the desired result.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
