Output State: **size_overlap is (1, 0).**

Explanation: The loop iterates over a range from the maximum value of `sequence` (considered as 0 in this case due to the default parameter) down to -1. For each iteration, it calculates `size` and `value` based on the current index `i`. The inner while loop adjusts `size` and `value` until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is met. Given that `number` is not specified, we assume it to be 0 for the purpose of determining the output state. When `i` is 0, `value` becomes 1, which satisfies the condition `value <= number`, and thus `size_overlap` is set to `(1, 0)` and the loop breaks.
