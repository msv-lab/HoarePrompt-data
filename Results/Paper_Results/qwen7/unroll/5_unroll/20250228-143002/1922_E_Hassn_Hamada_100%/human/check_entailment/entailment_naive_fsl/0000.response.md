Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not seem to generate the correct sequence for the given input `X`. 

For example, consider the input `X = 2`. According to the problem description, we need an array with exactly 2 increasing subsequences. A simple valid array could be `[0]`, which has exactly 2 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence and the subsequence `[0]` itself. However, the program generates an array of length 1 containing `0`, which is not necessarily the only valid solution, but it does meet the requirement.

However, for other values of `X`, the program fails to generate the correct array. For instance, for `X = 5`, a valid array could be `[0, 1, 0]`, which has exactly 5 increasing subsequences: the empty subsequence, `[0]`, `[1]`, `[0, 1]`, and `[1, 0]`. But the program generates an array of length 3 containing `[0, 1, 0]`, which is not necessarily the only valid solution, but it does meet the requirement.

The main issue is that the function `func_1` seems to be generating sequences based on a specific algorithm that may not always produce the correct number of increasing subsequences for arbitrary values of `X`. Therefore, the program does not guarantee the correct output for every potential case, making it incorrect.
