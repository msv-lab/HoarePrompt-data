Output State: **number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are within the range [-10^9, 10^9].**

Explanation: The provided code is a docstring that describes the function's purpose and arguments. It does not contain any executable statements that would modify the values of `number` or `sequence`. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.
