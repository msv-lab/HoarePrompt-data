Output State: size_overlap is (1, 0)

Explanation: The loop iterates from the maximum value of the `sequence` (considered as 0 in this case) down to -1. For each iteration, it calculates `size` and `value` based on the formula provided. The inner `while` loop adjusts `size` and `value` until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) > number` is met. Since `number` is not specified, we assume it's large enough to allow the first iteration to set `size` to 1 and `i` to 0, thus setting `size_overlap` to (1, 0).
