Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the result of calling `func_2()`.**

Explanation: The code `arr = func_2()` assigns the return value of the function `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they were returned from the function `func_1`. Therefore, `n` and `k` retain their initial states, and `arr` now holds the result of `func_2()`.
