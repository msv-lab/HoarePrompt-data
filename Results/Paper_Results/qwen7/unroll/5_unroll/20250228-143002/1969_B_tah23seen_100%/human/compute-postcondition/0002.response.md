Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used to iterate over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the initial state of the loop variables**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the value of each character in the string `s` during each iteration.
   - `s`: This is the binary string being iterated over.

3. **Initial values**:
   - `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000.
   - `cost` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).
   - `one` is 0 (though this variable is not used in the loop head).

4. **Loop execution condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. Therefore, the loop will execute if `s` is non-empty.

5. **Adjusting the states**:
   - Since `s` is a binary string, we don't need to adjust its content or length directly. We just need to ensure that it is a valid binary string.
   - The variable `i` will take on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration, starting from the first character.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

- `s` must be a non-empty binary string.
- `i` should start as the first character of `s`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`**.
