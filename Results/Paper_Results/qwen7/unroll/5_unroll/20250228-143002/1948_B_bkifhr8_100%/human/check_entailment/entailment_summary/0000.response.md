Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program attempts to check if the array can be made non-decreasing by performing a single swap of adjacent elements, rather than by repeatedly splitting and reinserting digits as specified in the problem statement. This means the program's logic is fundamentally different from what is required.

To properly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the length of the array and the array itself.
3. Check if it's possible to transform the array into a non-decreasing order by repeatedly applying the digit-splitting operation.
4. Print 'YES' if it's possible, and 'NO' otherwise.

The given program incorrectly checks for a single swap condition, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be transformed as described. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
