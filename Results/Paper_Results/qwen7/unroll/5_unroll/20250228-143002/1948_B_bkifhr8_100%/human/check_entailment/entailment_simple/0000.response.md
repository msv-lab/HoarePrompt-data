Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic for checking if it's possible to sort the array using the allowed operations is flawed.
2. The program attempts to check if the array can be sorted by iterating backward through the array and comparing adjacent elements. If an element is smaller than the previous one, it tries to split the larger element and check if the resulting sequence is sorted.
3. However, the logic for checking if the split sequence is sorted (`if nums != sorted(nums):`) is incorrect. This check is unnecessary because the operation itself ensures that the digits are placed in non-decreasing order when an element is split.
4. Instead, the program should focus on ensuring that after splitting, the new sequence is non-decreasing. It should also handle edge cases, such as when the array is already sorted or when it can be made sorted through the allowed operations.
5. The program should maintain a flag to indicate if the array can be sorted and update this flag accordingly.

Given these points, the annotated program is incorrect in its approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
