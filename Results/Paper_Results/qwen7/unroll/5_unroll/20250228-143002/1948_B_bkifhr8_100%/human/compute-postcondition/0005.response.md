Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 50 \)) followed by \( n \) integers \( a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \) (each between 0 and 99). For each test case, it checks if the sequence can be made non-decreasing by swapping adjacent elements at most once. If such a swap is possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
