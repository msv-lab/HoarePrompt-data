State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 50**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses the variable `_` as the loop variable, which is typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed within the loop body. This means the loop will execute `n` times.
2. The loop's condition depends solely on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer.
3. Given the constraints on `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), we need to ensure that `n` falls within this range.
4. The initial value of `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3) does not affect the loop's execution and does not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `n` is within the specified range for the loop to execute.
