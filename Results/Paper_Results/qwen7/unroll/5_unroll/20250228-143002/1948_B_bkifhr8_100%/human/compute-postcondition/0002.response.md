Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, each iteration of the loop processes a list `arr` of integers, and prints either 'NO' or 'YES' based on whether the condition `nums != sorted(nums)` is met for any element in `arr`. After all iterations, the final output state will be a series of 'NO' or 'YES' based on the processed lists `arr` for each input value of `n`.
