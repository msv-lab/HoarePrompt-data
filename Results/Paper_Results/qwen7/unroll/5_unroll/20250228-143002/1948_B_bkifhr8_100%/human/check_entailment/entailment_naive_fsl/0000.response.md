Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the array needs to be transformed into a sorted array by splitting elements that are at least 10. Specifically, the program checks if the current element is less than the previous element and attempts to split the previous element to see if it can be made non-decreasing. However, the logic inside the loop is flawed. It only checks if the split digits of the previous element, plus the current element, are sorted, but it does not actually perform the split and reinsert the digits back into the array. Instead, it just sets the previous element to the first digit of the split result, which may not necessarily lead to a sorted array.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
12 3 45 67
```
The program would check:
- `3 < 45` and attempt to split `45` to `[4, 5]`, but it doesn't reinsert these digits back into the array. It just sets `45` to `4`, which results in the array `[12, 3, 4, 67]`, which is still not sorted.

A correct approach would involve actually performing the split and reinsertion of digits back into the array to ensure the array becomes sorted.
