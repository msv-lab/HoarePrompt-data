Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, as it was not affected by the code. The value of `t` is still within the range 1 to 10^3. The value of `n` is now an integer input by the user and falls within the specified range 2 to 50.
