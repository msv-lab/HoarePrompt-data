Based on the initial state and the conditions described:

1. The list `list` undergoes modifications for each `i` from 1 to `n-2` under specific conditions.
2. These conditions involve checking if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`.
3. If the conditions are met, certain operations are performed on the list elements.
4. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately.
5. If no early termination occurs, the function `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True.

Given the final state after all operations, the print statement `print('YES')` is executed. Since the function `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True, it implies that no 'no' was printed during the process, and the list modifications were successful according to the conditions.

Output: **YES**
