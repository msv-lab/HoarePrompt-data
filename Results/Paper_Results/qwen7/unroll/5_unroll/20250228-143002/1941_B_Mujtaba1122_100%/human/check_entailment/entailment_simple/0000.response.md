### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. The operations involve selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \le i \le n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by specific amounts.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds a non-zero element. If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.
   - **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function attempts to reduce the array elements to zero by repeatedly applying the specified operations. It uses a nested loop structure where it checks and applies the operations if certain conditions are met. If at any point it cannot apply the operations (i.e., if `list[i-1]` becomes zero before reducing `list[i]` and `list[i+1]`), it prints 'NO' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'NO', it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are now zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

3. **Execution Flow**:
   - For each test case, `func_2` is called, which tries to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operations.
   - If `func_2` successfully reduces the array to all zeros, `func_1` will return `True`, and 'YES' will be printed.
   - If `func_2` fails to reduce the array to all zeros, 'NO' will be printed.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operations and checks if the array can be reduced to all zeros.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the array are zero.
   - The overall structure ensures that the program outputs the correct result for each test case.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
