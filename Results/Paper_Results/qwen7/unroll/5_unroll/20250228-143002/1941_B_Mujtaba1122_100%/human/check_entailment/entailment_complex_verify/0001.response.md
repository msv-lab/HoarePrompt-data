### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array `a` zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation.
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) and decrementing `a_{i-1}`, `a_i`, and `a_{i+1}` by specific amounts (`-1`, `-2`, and `-1` respectively).

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - **Function `func_1`:** This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero, otherwise `False`.
   - **Function `func_2`:** This function attempts to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation. If at any point the operation cannot be applied (i.e., there's no valid `i` where the conditions are met), it prints 'NO' and returns. If all elements eventually become zero, it prints 'YES'.

3. **Checking Function `func_2`:**
   - The loop in `func_2` iterates through indices `i` from `1` to `n-2` (inclusive).
   - Inside the loop, it uses a `while` loop to apply the operation as long as the conditions allow (i.e., `list[i] > 1`, `list[i-1] > 0`, and `list[i+1] > 0`).
   - After applying the operation, it checks if `list[i-1]` is still non-zero. If so, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - Finally, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.

4. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operation and checks if it can make all elements zero.
   - The `while` loop ensures that the operation is applied as long as possible for each valid index `i`.
   - The final check with `func_1` ensures that the array is indeed all zeros before printing 'YES'.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the operation. The operation should only be applied if `list[i] >= 2 * list[i-1] + 1` to ensure that the operation can be repeated until `list[i]` becomes zero. The current implementation may lead to incorrect results if `list[i] < 2 * list[i-1] + 1`.

5. **Annotated Code Validation:**
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the logic flow.
   - The state transitions and the final check with `func_1` are accurate.
   - However, the operation itself is not correctly implemented, leading to potential incorrect results.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operation due to the flawed implementation of the operation. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
