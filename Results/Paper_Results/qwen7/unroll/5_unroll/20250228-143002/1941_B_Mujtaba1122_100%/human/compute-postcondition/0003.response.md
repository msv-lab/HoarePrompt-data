Postcondition: **The list `list` has undergone modifications based on the conditions within the loop. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i+1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`, `list[i]` is decreased by `2 * list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by `list[i-1]`. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. After all iterations, if no early termination occurs, the final state of the list `list` is the result of these operations. The function `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to True.**
