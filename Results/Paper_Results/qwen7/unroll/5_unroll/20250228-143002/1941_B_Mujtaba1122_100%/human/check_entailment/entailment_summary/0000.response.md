Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero using a specific operation.
- The provided solution consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero.
- `func_2` attempts to reduce the array elements to zero by repeatedly applying the specified operation. If at any point the operation cannot be applied (i.e., the conditions are not met), it immediately prints 'NO' and returns. If the loop completes without issues, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are now zero and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
- Given the execution summary, `func_2` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros by checking the conditions for applying the operation and ensuring no violations occur.
- Since `func_1` also correctly checks if all elements are zero, and `func_2` ensures that the array can be reduced to all zeros if possible, the overall solution meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
