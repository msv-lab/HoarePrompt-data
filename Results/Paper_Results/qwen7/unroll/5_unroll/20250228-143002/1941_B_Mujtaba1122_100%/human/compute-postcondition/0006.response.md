Based on the initial state and the operations described, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We know that the function `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to `False`. This implies that the loop will run through all iterations without any early termination due to the condition `list[i-1] != 0`.

2. **Loop Operations**: For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if the following conditions are met:
   - `list[i] > 1`
   - `list[i-1] > 0`
   - `list[i+1] > 0`

   The operations performed are:
   - `list[i+1] -= list[i-1]`
   - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
   - `list[i-1] -= list[i-1]` (which simplifies to `list[i-1] = 0`)

3. **Early Termination**: If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. Since `func_1(list, n)` evaluates to `False`, this means no such point exists where `list[i-1]` is not zero during the loop execution.

4. **Final State**: After all iterations, since no early termination occurred, the final state of the list `list` is the result of these operations.

Given that the loop runs through all iterations without any early termination, the only print statement in the code is `print('NO')`.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
