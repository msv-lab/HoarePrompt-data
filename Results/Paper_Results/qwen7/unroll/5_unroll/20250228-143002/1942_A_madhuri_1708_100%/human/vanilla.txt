- For \(k \geq 2\):
     - If \(n = k\), the code correctly generates a sorted array of length \(k\).
     - If \(n \neq k\), the code correctly prints `-1`, which is the right answer because it's impossible to have exactly \(k\) sorted cyclic shifts when \(k < n\).
   - For \(k = 1\):
     - The code generates an array where each element is its index plus one, ensuring that only the original array is sorted, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
Correctness:
