Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes two integers, `n` and `k`, with constraints 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^3 and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3. For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `n` and `k`.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing integers `n` and `k`. It checks the relationship between `n` and `k` and returns some form of output (though the specific output is not detailed in the given information) for each test case, ensuring that for all test cases combined, the sum of `n` does not exceed 10^3.
