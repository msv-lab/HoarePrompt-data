### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if there exists an order of participants such that all given screenshots match this order.
   - Each screenshot shows the order of participants as seen by a specific user, with that user always at the top.

2. **Key Observations:**
   - If `m == 1`, the order is trivially correct since only one user's perspective is given.
   - For `m > 1`, we need to check if the remaining participants' orders in the screenshots match after removing the user-specific element.

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of participants (`n`) and users who posted screenshots (`m`).
   - If `m == 1`, it prints 'yes' immediately.
   - For `m > 1`, it processes the first two screenshots to find common elements and differences.
   - It then checks subsequent screenshots against the derived order.

4. **Detailed Breakdown:**
   - **Case `m == 1`:**
     - The code correctly handles this case by printing 'yes'.
   - **Case `m > 1`:**
     - It extracts the unique elements from the first two screenshots.
     - It then checks if these elements match across subsequent screenshots.
     - It handles edge cases where the order might differ slightly by inserting the user-specific element back into the list.
     - Finally, it validates the remaining screenshots against the derived order.

5. **Validation:**
   - The logic correctly identifies if the derived order matches all screenshots.
   - The handling of edge cases (like differing positions of user-specific elements) is appropriately managed.
   - The overall structure ensures that the derived order is consistent with all given screenshots.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists a consistent order of participants that matches all given screenshots.

**Correctness: True**
