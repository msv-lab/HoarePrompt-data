Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, the program fails to properly handle cases where the initial orders of the screenshots do not align perfectly but still could represent the same underlying order of participants. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the following input:
```
3 2
1 2 3
3 2 1
```

In this case, the first screenshot shows the order `[1, 2, 3]` and the second screenshot shows the order `[3, 2, 1]`. According to the problem description, these two screenshots should be able to correspond to the same underlying order of participants, which is `[1, 2, 3]` or `[3, 2, 1]`.

However, the current implementation of the program does not correctly handle this scenario. The program checks if the elements in the lists `l11` and `l22` are equal after removing the author of the screenshot. In this case, `l11` would be `[2, 3]` and `l22` would be `[2, 1]`, which are not equal, leading the program to incorrectly conclude that the screenshots do not correspond to the same underlying order and prints 'no'.

To fix this, the program needs to consider the possibility that the initial orders of the screenshots might differ but still represent the same underlying order of participants. This requires a more sophisticated comparison logic that accounts for the relative positions of the elements in the lists.
