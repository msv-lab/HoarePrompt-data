Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each test case individually.
2. **Initial Check for Single Screenshot**: The function correctly identifies when only one screenshot is provided (`m == 1`) and prints 'yes' without further processing.
3. **Comparing Initial Screenshots**: The function compares the initial two screenshots (`a1` vs `a2`). It correctly identifies if the orders of the remaining participants are the same after excluding the author of the screenshot.
4. **Inserting Author into Order**: The function correctly inserts the author of the screenshot back into the order, ensuring that the author appears at the top.
5. **Handling Multiple Screenshots**: The function correctly processes additional screenshots by checking if they match the modified order. It uses a list `val` to store the additional screenshots and their corresponding orders.
6. **Final Validation**: The function validates the additional screenshots against the modified order and prints 'yes' if all conditions are met; otherwise, it prints 'no'.

Given the detailed analysis, the function appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all edge cases and performs the necessary checks to determine if the given screenshots can correspond to a consistent order of participants.

Correctness: **True**
