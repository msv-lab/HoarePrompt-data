The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of k lines with n unique integers ranging from 1 to n. It checks if certain conditions are met across these lines and inserts specific integers to satisfy those conditions. If all conditions are satisfied for all test cases, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.
