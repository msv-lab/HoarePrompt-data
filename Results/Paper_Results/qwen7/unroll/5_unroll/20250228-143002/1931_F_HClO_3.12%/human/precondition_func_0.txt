t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n⋅k ≤ 2⋅10^5. Each test case consists of k lines, where each line contains n integers representing the order of participants seen by a specific user. All integers in each line are unique and range from 1 to n.
