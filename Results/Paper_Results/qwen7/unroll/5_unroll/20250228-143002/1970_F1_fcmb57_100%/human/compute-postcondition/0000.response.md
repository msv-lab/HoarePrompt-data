Output State: **a is the value of the initial dimension N, y is the value of the initial dimension N, x is the value of the initial dimension N**.

Explanation: The code `x, y = a` unpacks the tuple `a` into two variables `x` and `y`. Since `a` represents the dimensions N and M of the field, both `x` and `y` will take the value of `a`, which is the initial dimension N. The initial state where `a` and `b` are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field remains unchanged except for the assignment of `x` and `y`.
