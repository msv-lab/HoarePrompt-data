### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies and stores the positions of goals and players.

2. **Movement and Scoring Logic**:
   - The program correctly updates the position of players based on their movements.
   - The logic for scoring is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the corresponding team scores a point, and the Quaffle returns to the center of the field.
   - The program prints the appropriate message when a team scores.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all the moves, the program correctly prints the final score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the movement of players and the throwing of the Quaffle correctly.
   - The scoring mechanism ensures that only the correct team scores when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
   - The program does not handle the case where a player might throw the Quaffle into their own goal, which would result in the opponent scoring a point. However, the problem statement guarantees that such invalid actions are not possible.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function is intended to update the position of a player based on a movement direction. But the function only returns the updated coordinates without updating the dictionary `players`. Therefore, the player's position is not actually updated in the `players` dictionary, leading to incorrect behavior during the scoring process.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
```
This function should update the `players` dictionary with the new position of the player, but it does not do so. Instead, it simply returns the new coordinates, which are not used anywhere in the program.

### Corrected Version:
To fix this issue, the function should update the `players` dictionary with the new position:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```
And then update the `players` dictionary:
```python
if mo[1] in 'ULDR':
    players[mo[0]] = func_1(players[mo[0]], mouvements[mo[1]])
```

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly update the player's position in the `players` dictionary after each movement. This leads to incorrect scoring and final score calculations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
