### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Setup**:
   - The program correctly reads the dimensions \( n \) and \( m \) of the field.
   - It initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals.
   - It correctly identifies and stores the positions of goals and players.

2. **Movement and Scoring Logic**:
   - The program correctly updates the position of players based on their movements.
   - The logic for scoring is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal, the corresponding team scores a point, and the Quaffle returns to the center of the field.
   - The program prints the appropriate message when a team scores.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - After processing all the moves, the program correctly prints the final score.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the movement of players and the throwing of the Quaffle correctly.
   - The scoring mechanism ensures that only the correct team scores when a player throws the Quaffle into the opponent's goal.
   - The program does not handle the case where a player might throw the Quaffle into their own goal, which would result in the opponent scoring a point. However, the problem statement guarantees that such invalid actions are not possible.

However, upon closer inspection, there is a critical issue with the implementation of the `func_1` function. The function is supposed to update the coordinates of a player based on the direction of movement, but it incorrectly uses the field dimensions `n` and `m` instead of the player's current coordinates. This leads to an incorrect update of the player's position.

Here is the problematic part of the code:
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    (x, y) = a
    (dx, dy) = b
    return (x + dx, y + dy)
```

The function should simply add the movement direction `(dx, dy)` to the current coordinates `(x, y)` without using `n` and `m`. The current implementation is correct, but the function summary provided in the original assessment is misleading. The function summary should state that the function updates the coordinates of a player based on the movement direction, not that it adds the dimensions of the field.

### Conclusion:

- The program logic for handling player movements, scoring, and final score calculation is correct.
- The function `func_1` is implemented correctly, but the function summary provided in the original assessment is inaccurate.

Given these points, the original assessment is accurate in terms of the overall correctness of the program, but the function summary needs to be corrected.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and examples provided, despite the misleading function summary.
