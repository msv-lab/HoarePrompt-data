Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters describing a row of the field. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG for red goals and BG for blue goals), players (R0-R9 for red players and B0-B9 for blue players), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The number of steps T is an integer where 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, and the actions for each step are described as pairs of characters indicating the entity performing the action and the action itself (U, D, L, R for movement, C for catching, T for throwing).**
