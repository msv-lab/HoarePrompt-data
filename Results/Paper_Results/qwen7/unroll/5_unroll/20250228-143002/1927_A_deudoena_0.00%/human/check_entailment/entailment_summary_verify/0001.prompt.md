You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    inpstr = input()
    ind1 = 0
    ind2 = 0
    outind = 0
    for (i, j) in enumerate(inpstr):
        if j == 'B':
            ind1 = i
            break
    for i in range(len(inpstr)):
        if inpstr[-i - 1] == 'B':
            ind2 = i
            break
    print(len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `inpstr` containing characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B' in the string. After determining these indices (`ind1` and `ind2`), it calculates and prints the number of characters between the first and last 'B' (excluding the 'B' characters themselves). The function does not return any value but modifies and prints the result based on the input string.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells in the strip become white. This means we need to find the longest segment of consecutive black cells, because painting this segment will turn all black cells to white.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code**:
   - The code reads an input string `inpstr` but does not handle multiple test cases as specified in the problem statement.
   - It initializes `ind1` and `ind2` to store indices of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - The first loop finds the index of the first black cell (`ind1`).
   - The second loop finds the index of the last black cell (`ind2`), but it starts from the end of the string and works backwards.
   - Finally, it prints the length of the segment from `ind1` to `ind2`, which is calculated as `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1`.

3. **Identifying the Error**:
   - The calculation `len(inpstr) - ind2 - ind1` is incorrect. To find the length of the segment from the first black cell to the last black cell, you should use `ind2 - ind1 + 1`.
   - Additionally, the function does not handle multiple test cases. It only processes one input string at a time.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - For each test case, read the length `n` and the string `s`.
   - Find the first and last indices of black cells ('B') in the string.
   - Calculate the distance between these indices plus one to get the required segment length.
   - Output the result for each test case.

Given the above analysis, the provided code is incorrect due to the wrong formula used to calculate the segment length and its inability to handle multiple test cases.
