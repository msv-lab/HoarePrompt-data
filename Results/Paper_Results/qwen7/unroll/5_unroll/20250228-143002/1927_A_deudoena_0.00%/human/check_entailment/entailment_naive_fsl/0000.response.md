Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. Specifically, the program only considers the first and last positions of black cells but does not account for the possibility of multiple segments of black cells within the strip. 

For example, consider the input "WBWBWWWBW". The program would incorrectly output 4, whereas the correct answer is 7, as the segment from the 2nd to the 8th cell (inclusive) needs to be painted white to make all cells white.

To fix this, the program should iterate through the string and keep track of the start and end indices of consecutive black segments, then calculate the minimum length required to cover all black cells.
