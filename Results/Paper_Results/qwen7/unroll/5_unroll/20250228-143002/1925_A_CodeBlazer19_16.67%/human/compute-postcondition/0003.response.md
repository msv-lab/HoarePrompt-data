Output State: The output state will consist of multiple strings printed based on the input values of `n` and `k`. For each iteration of the outer loop, if `k` is 1, it will print `n` times the string 'a'. If `k` is greater than 1, it will print `(2 - (n == 1))` times the string containing characters from 'a' to the character with ASCII value `k+96`. The total number of such strings printed will be equal to the value of `t`.
