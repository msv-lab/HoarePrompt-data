Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives values through variables t, n, and k where 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, 1 ≤ n ≤ 26, and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26. It returns a value based on the conditions specified for these variables.**

This means the function is designed to work with three variables: `t`, `n`, and `k`, which are constrained within specific ranges. The function does not accept these variables as direct parameters but uses them internally to determine the output.
