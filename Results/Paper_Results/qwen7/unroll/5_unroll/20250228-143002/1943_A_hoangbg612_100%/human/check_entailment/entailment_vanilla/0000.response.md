Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary since the order of elements in the array doesn't affect the MEX calculation directly. However, sorting might help in some edge cases where the order of operations matters.

3. **Tracking the Current MEX**:
   - The variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`, representing the current MEX value.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the array `N`.

4. **Processing Each Number**:
   - The program iterates through each number in the sorted array `N`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates `cur` to `num` and sets the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M` to 1.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation**:
   - If the sum of counts in the dictionary `M` equals the size of the array `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then creates a list `cnt` of keys from the dictionary `M` where the count is 1.
   - If there are at least two such keys, it sets `cur` to the second key in the list `cnt`.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`, which is supposed to be the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation**:
   - The logic for updating `cur` and the dictionary `M` is flawed. The goal is to simulate the game moves and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`. The current implementation does not correctly simulate the game moves.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The program does not implement the optimal strategy for both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current logic does not account for these strategies.

3. **Unnecessary Sorting**:
   - Sorting the array `N` is unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the solution.

### Correct Solution

To solve this problem correctly, we need to simulate the game moves and determine the MEX of the resulting array `c` based on the optimal strategy for both players. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Alice's turn: pick the smallest available number
        c = []
        for _ in range(S // 2):
            min_num = min(N)
            c.append(min_num)
            N.remove(min_num)

        # Bob's turn: pick the largest available number
        for _ in range(S // 2):
            max_num = max(N)
            N.remove(max_num)

        # Determine the MEX of the resulting array c
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1

        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect due to the flawed logic for simulating the game moves and determining the MEX. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
