Output State: T is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ T ≤ 2⋅10^4. After executing all iterations of the loop, for each input case, the variable `cur` holds the second smallest number that appears exactly once in the sorted list `N`, or the smallest number if no such number exists, or `cur+1` if all numbers appear more than once.
