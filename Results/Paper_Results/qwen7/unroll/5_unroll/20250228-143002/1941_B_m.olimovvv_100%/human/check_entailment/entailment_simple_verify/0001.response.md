### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key points and logic flow of the program. Let's break down the analysis again to ensure completeness and accuracy:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (inclusive) and checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, it immediately prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, which is correct because negative values would make further operations invalid.
   - For each valid `b[i]`, it performs the following operations:
     - `b[i+1] -= b[i] * 2`: This operation reduces `b[i+1]` by twice the value of `b[i]`.
     - `b[i+2] -= b[i]`: This operation reduces `b[i+2]` by the value of `b[i]`.
     - `b[i] -= b[i]`: This line is indeed redundant and sets `b[i]` to 0, but it doesn't affect the overall correctness since `b[i]` is already being reduced to 0 by the previous operations.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array (`b[-1]` and `b[-2]`) are zero. If either of them is non-zero, it prints 'NO', indicating that the array cannot be made entirely zero. Otherwise, it prints 'YES', indicating that the array can be made entirely zero.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles the case where `b[i]` becomes negative, ensuring that no further operations are performed on invalid states.
   - The final check ensures that no residual non-zero elements remain after processing.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. It handles edge cases appropriately and follows the problem constraints.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
