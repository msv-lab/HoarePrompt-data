Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then checks if all elements in the list \( a \) are non-negative and if certain arithmetic operations performed on consecutive elements result in specific conditions being met. If these conditions are satisfied for all test cases, it outputs 'YES'; otherwise, it outputs 'NO'.**
