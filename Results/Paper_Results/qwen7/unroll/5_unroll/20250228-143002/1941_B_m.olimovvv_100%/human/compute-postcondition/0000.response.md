Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (let's call it `num_tests`) is a positive integer. Given the constraints, `num_tests` should be within the range 1 to \(10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop depends on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range. The initial state provides that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This means that `t` can serve as the input value for the loop.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that the input value is within the valid range for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
