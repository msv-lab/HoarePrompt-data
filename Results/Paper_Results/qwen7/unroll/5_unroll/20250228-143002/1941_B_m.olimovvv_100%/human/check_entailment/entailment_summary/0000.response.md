Reasoning:
1. The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the array and performing operations based on the given rules.
2. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically, the program checks if all elements in the array are non-negative after performing the operations but does not correctly simulate the operations as described in the problem statement.
3. The program should simulate the operations where for each index \(i\) (from 2 to \(n-1\)), it reduces \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) according to the specified rules until no further operations can be performed.
4. After simulating these operations, the program should check if all elements in the array are zero.
5. The current implementation only checks if the first few elements are non-negative and does not correctly simulate the operations as required.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
