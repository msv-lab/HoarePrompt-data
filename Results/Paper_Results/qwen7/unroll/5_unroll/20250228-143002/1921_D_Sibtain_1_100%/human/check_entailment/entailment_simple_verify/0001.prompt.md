You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as the result of the loop's execution for each test case. Each integer represents the calculated value of `ans` for that specific test case based on the given conditions and operations within the loop. The values of `ans` are determined by sorting lists `a` and `c`, comparing elements from opposite ends of these sorted lists, and summing up the maximum absolute differences until all elements are processed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) where \(a_i\) is Petya's array and \(c_i\) is Vasya's array constructed from \(b_i\).

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Single Value Arrays**: If both arrays contain the same single value, the difference \(D\) is zero.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order helps in maximizing the differences.
3. **Pairwise Assignment**: Assign the largest values of \(c\) to the smallest values of \(a\) and vice versa to maximize the absolute differences.

### Analysis of the Given Program
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - It reads \(n\) and \(m\), the lengths of the arrays.
   - It reads the arrays \(a\) and \(c\).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If all elements in \(a\) and \(c\) are the same, it prints 0. This is correct.

3. **Sorting**:
   - \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - \(c\) is sorted in descending order.
   - This is correct as it helps in maximizing the differences.

4. **Pairwise Assignment**:
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the sorted arrays.
   - It calculates the maximum difference between corresponding elements of the sorted arrays.
   - It accumulates these differences into `ans`.

### Detailed Walkthrough
- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
  ```
  - `i` starts at the beginning of `a`.
  - `j` starts at the second position in `c`.

- **Loop through elements**:
  ```python
  for k in range(len(a)):
      t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
      t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
  ```
  - `t1` is the difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `c`.
  - `t2` is the difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`.

- **Update Pointers**:
  ```python
  if t2 > t1:
      j += 1
  else:
      i += 1
  ```
  - If `t2` is greater, move the pointer `j` to the next element in `c`.
  - Otherwise, move the pointer `i` to the next element in `a`.

- **Accumulate Differences**:
  ```python
  ans += max(t1, t2)
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```python
  print(ans)
  ```

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the edge cases and follows the logic to maximize the differences. The sorting and pairwise assignment ensure that the differences are maximized.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
