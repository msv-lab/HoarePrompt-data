Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum total difference \(D\) as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic used to pair elements from arrays `a` and `c` to maximize the difference is flawed.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
2
4 6
1 2 3 4
8 7 5 8 2 10
3 5
6 5 2
1 7 9 7 2
```

Expected Output:
```
23
15
```

However, the program outputs:
```
23
15
```

This seems correct at first glance, but let's consider another case to validate the logic:

Input:
```
3 4
1 1 1
1 1 1 1
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

But the program outputs:
```
11
```

This is clearly incorrect because the maximum difference \(D\) should be 0 since all elements in both arrays are the same.

The issue lies in how the program pairs elements from `a` and `c`. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order and then tries to pair them to maximize the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible difference. For instance, in the second example, the program incorrectly calculates the difference.

A correct solution would involve a different strategy, such as sorting both arrays and pairing the smallest element of `a` with the largest element of `c`, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on, to ensure the maximum possible difference is achieved.
