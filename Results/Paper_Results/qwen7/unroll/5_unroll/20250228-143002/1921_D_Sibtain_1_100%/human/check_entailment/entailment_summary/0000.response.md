Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each one.
2. **Identical Unique Elements Check**: The check for identical unique elements in `a` and `c` is handled correctly. If both lists have the same unique element, the function prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
3. **Sorting Lists**: The function sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This is a good strategy to maximize the differences since sorting in opposite orders allows the smallest elements of one list to be paired with the largest elements of the other list.
4. **Iterating Through Lists**: The function iterates through both sorted lists, calculating the maximum absolute difference between corresponding elements and accumulating these differences. This ensures that the differences are maximized.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when `len(a) == 1` by calculating the difference between the single element in `a` and the maximum and minimum elements in `c`.

Given the above points, the function appears to follow the logic required to solve the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
