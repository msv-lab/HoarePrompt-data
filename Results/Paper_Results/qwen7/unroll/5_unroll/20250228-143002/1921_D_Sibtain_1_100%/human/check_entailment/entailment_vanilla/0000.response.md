Let's analyze the given Python program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Understanding
The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) where \(a_i\) is Petya's array and \(c_i\) is Vasya's array constructed from \(b_i\).

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Single Value Arrays**: If both arrays contain the same single value, the difference \(D\) is zero.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order helps in maximizing the differences.
3. **Pairwise Assignment**: Assign the largest values of \(c\) to the smallest values of \(a\) and vice versa to maximize the absolute differences.

### Analysis of the Given Program
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - It reads \(n\) and \(m\), the lengths of the arrays.
   - It reads the arrays \(a\) and \(c\).

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If all elements in \(a\) and \(c\) are the same, it prints 0. This is correct.

3. **Sorting**:
   - \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - \(c\) is sorted in descending order.
   - This is correct as it helps in maximizing the differences.

4. **Pairwise Assignment**:
   - The program uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the sorted arrays.
   - It calculates the maximum difference between corresponding elements of the sorted arrays.
   - It accumulates these differences into `ans`.

### Detailed Walkthrough
- **Initialization**:
  ```python
  (i, j, ans) = (0, 1, 0)
  ```
  - `i` starts at the beginning of `a`.
  - `j` starts at the second position in `c`.

- **Loop through elements**:
  ```python
  for k in range(len(a)):
      t1 = abs(a[i] - c[i])
      t2 = abs(a[len(a) - j] - c[len(c) - j])
  ```
  - `t1` is the difference between the current element of `a` and the current element of `c`.
  - `t2` is the difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `c`.

- **Update Pointers**:
  ```python
  if t2 > t1:
      j += 1
  else:
      i += 1
  ```
  - If `t2` is greater, move the pointer `j` to the next element in `c`.
  - Otherwise, move the pointer `i` to the next element in `a`.

- **Accumulate Differences**:
  ```python
  ans += max(t1, t2)
  ```

- **Output**:
  ```python
  print(ans)
  ```

### Conclusion
The program correctly handles the edge cases and follows the logic to maximize the differences. The sorting and pairwise assignment ensure that the differences are maximized.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
