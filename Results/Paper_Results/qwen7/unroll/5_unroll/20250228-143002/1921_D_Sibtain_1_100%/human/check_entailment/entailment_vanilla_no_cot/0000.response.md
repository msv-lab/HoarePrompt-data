Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Special Case Handling**: If both `a` and `c` contain identical elements, the total difference `D` would be zero. The code checks for this condition and prints `0` if true.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: 
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `c` is sorted in descending order.
   
   Sorting helps in maximizing the differences between corresponding elements of `a` and `c`.

3. **Iterative Calculation of Differences**:
   - The code iterates through the arrays using indices `i` and `j`.
   - For each element in `a`, it calculates the difference with the largest and smallest remaining elements in `c`.
   - It accumulates the maximum of these differences into `ans`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `a` contains only one unique element, the code handles this by comparing the single element of `a` with the largest and smallest elements of `c`.

This approach ensures that the total difference `D` is maximized by strategically pairing elements from `a` and `c`. The logic is sound and should work for all given constraints and examples.
