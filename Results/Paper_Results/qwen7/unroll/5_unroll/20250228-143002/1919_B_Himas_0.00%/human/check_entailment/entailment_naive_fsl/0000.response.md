Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. Specifically, the program is designed to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and then print the difference between these counts. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
1
6
+-+-+-
```

Expected Output:
```
0
```

Explanation: The optimal way to split the array `a` is into `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, which results in a total penalty of `0`. However, the provided program would output `2` because it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters and prints their difference.

Since the program does not handle the splitting of the array into subarrays to minimize the penalty, it is not correct according to the problem description.
