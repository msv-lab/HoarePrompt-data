### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the problem description step-by-step:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` into non-empty subarrays.
   - The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
   - The total penalty is the sum of penalties of all subarrays.

2. **Function Summary**:
   - The function `func()` reads multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`.
   - It calculates and prints the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`.

3. **Program Code Analysis**:
   - The program reads an integer `i` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `s` (which should be the length of the string `e`), but it is actually reading the length as an integer and not using it.
   - It then reads the string `e`.
   - It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the number of '+' and '-' characters respectively.
   - It iterates through the string `e` and updates `P` and `M` based on the characters.
   - Finally, it prints the difference `P - M`.

4. **Correctness Evaluation**:
   - The program correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`.
   - However, this count (`P - M`) is not the same as the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem.
   - The problem requires finding the optimal way to split the array into subarrays to minimize the total penalty, which involves more complex logic than simply counting the number of '+' and '-' characters.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided function does not solve the problem correctly because it does not account for the optimal splitting of the array to minimize the penalty.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
