Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. Specifically, the program checks if there is a digit after a letter but does not ensure that all digits come before any letters. Here is a counterexample:

- Input: `123abc`
- Expected Output: `NO` (since there are digits after letters)
- Program Output: `YES` (the program only checks if digits and letters are sorted separately and does not check the relative positions of digits and letters)

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all digits come before any letters in the password. This can be done by checking the relative positions of digits and letters as they appear in the password.
