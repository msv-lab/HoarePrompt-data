Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is initialized to 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 because the range function in Python is defined as `range(start, stop)`, where `start` is inclusive and `stop` is exclusive. Therefore, the loop will start executing when `i` is 1.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Once `i` becomes equal to `n`, the loop will terminate.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the initial value of `i` is 1 and that `n` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The initial value of `i` must be 1.
   - The value of `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure that the loop can execute at least once.

The other variables (`t`, `k`, `nums`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
