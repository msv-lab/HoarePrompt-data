Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to 0. It then calculates the first element `nums[0]` as `(1 << k's bit length - 1) - 1 + k`. For each subsequent element `nums[i]` (where `i` ranges from 1 to `n-1`), it sets the value to `k` if `k` is greater than 0, and 1 otherwise. After processing, it ensures `k` is set to 0. Finally, it returns the list `nums`.**
