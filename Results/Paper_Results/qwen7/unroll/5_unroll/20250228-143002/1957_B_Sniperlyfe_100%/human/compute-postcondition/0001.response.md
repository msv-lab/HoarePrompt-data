Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` containing `n` zeros; `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `nums[0]` to a specific value based on the value of `k`. Specifically, it calculates `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This means that `nums[0]` is set to a value that is one less than the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `2^k`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
