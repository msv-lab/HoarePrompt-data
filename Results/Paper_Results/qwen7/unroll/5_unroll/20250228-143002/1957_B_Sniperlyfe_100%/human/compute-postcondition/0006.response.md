Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where `nums[0]` is (1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1 + `k`, and for all `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is equal to `k` if `k > 0` and 1 otherwise, with `k` being 0 after the loop finishes.**

Explanation: The code `nums[0] += k` increments the value of `nums[0]` by `k`. Initially, `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1`. After adding `k` to `nums[0]`, the new value of `nums[0]` becomes `(1 << (`k`'s bit length - 1)) - 1 + `k`. All other elements in the list `nums` remain unchanged, and `k` is set to 0 after the loop finishes.
