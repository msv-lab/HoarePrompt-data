Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k` for each case. This part is correct.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with all elements set to `0`.
   - It sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k`'s bit length minus one.
   - It then adjusts `k` by subtracting this value from `k`.
   - In the subsequent loop, it tries to distribute the remaining `k` among the other elements of `nums` while ensuring that each element is at most `nums[0] + 1`.
   - Finally, it adds the remaining value of `k` to `nums[0]`.

3. **Binary OR Operation Consideration**:
   - The goal is to maximize the number of 1s in the binary representation of the bitwise OR of all elements in `nums`.
   - The strategy of setting `nums[0]` to the largest possible number with `k` bits ensures that the first element contributes significantly to the OR result.
   - Distributing the remaining `k` among the other elements ensures that the total sum is maintained and the OR result is maximized.

4. **Output Handling**:
   - The program constructs the output string for each test case and appends it to the `results` list.
   - After processing all test cases, it prints the results in the required format.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is small enough, the initial assignment of `nums[0]` might not fully utilize the available `k`, but the subsequent distribution ensures that the sum is met and the OR result is maximized.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement and handles the constraints appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
