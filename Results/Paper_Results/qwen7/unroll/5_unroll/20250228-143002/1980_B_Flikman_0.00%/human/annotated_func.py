#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000. For each test case, n, f, and k are integers such that 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100, and a is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 100 for all i in range n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        favorite_value = a[f - 1]
        
        same_value_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value == favorite_value:
                same_value_count += 1
        
        greater_count = 0
        
        for value in a:
            if value > favorite_value:
                greater_count += 1
        
        if greater_count >= k:
            print('YES')
        elif greater_count + same_value_count <= k:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('MAYBE')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' based on the conditions evaluated within each iteration of the loop. For each input set, the program first reads an integer `t`, then iterates `t` times. During each iteration, it reads three integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers `a`. It then determines the favorite value (the `(f-1)`th element in `a`), counts how many elements are the same as the favorite value (`same_value_count`), and counts how many elements are greater than the favorite value (`greater_count`). Based on these counts, it prints 'YES' if there are at least `k` elements greater than the favorite value, 'NO' if the sum of elements equal to and greater than the favorite value does not meet or exceed `k`, and 'MAYBE' otherwise.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n`, `f`, and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It identifies the favorite value as the `(f-1)`th element in `a`. It then counts how many elements in `a` are the same as the favorite value and how many are greater than the favorite value. Based on these counts, it prints 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE' for each test case. The function does not return any value but outputs the results directly.
