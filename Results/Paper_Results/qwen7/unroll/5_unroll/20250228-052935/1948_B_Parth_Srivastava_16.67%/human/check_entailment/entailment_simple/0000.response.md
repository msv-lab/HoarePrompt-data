Reasoning:
1. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic inside the `func_1()` function does not accurately simulate the operation described in the problem statement.
2. The program reads multiple test cases but only processes one test case per iteration of the outer loop, which is incorrect because it should process all test cases.
3. The variable `b` is used to store results for each test case, but the logic to determine if the array can be sorted is flawed. The code checks if `c` (the modified array) is sorted, but it does not account for the possibility of inserting digits from larger numbers into smaller positions, which could potentially make the array sortable.
4. The program does not handle the case where the array can be made sorted after performing the operations, as it only checks if the final array `c` is sorted, without considering the intermediate steps and the possibility of making the array sortable through the described operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
