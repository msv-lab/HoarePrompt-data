### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `m` and initializes an empty list `b` to store results.
   - However, it calls `func_1()` in a loop but does not use the results of `func_1()`. This is incorrect because the results of `func_1()` should be stored in `b`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `k` and the array itself.
   - It splits the array into individual digits and stores them in a list `c`.
   - The function checks if the current element is greater than 10 and attempts to break it down into its constituent digits.
   - However, the function does not ensure that the resulting array can be sorted. It simply checks if the resulting array `c` is sorted without considering the original array's structure and the operations allowed.
   - The function does not simulate the transformation process to check if the original array `a` can be sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Sorting Check**:
   - The function sorts the list `c` and checks if it matches the original list `a`. This is incorrect because the original array `a` might not match the sorted list `c` after breaking down elements. The function should instead check if the original array `a` can be transformed into a sorted array through the allowed operations.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input:
    ```
    1
    4
    12 3 45 67
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    YES
    ```
  - Actual Output:
    The program does not correctly handle this case and may output `NO` because it does not properly simulate the transformation process.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input:
    ```
    3
    2
    12 28
    3
    12 28 5
    2
    0 0
    ```
  - Expected Output:
    ```
    NO
    NO
    YES
    ```
  - Actual Output:
    The program outputs `NO` for the first two cases and `YES` for the last case, indicating it does not correctly simulate the transformation process.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the array contains elements that cannot be broken down into smaller digits in a way that allows the array to be sorted. The function `func_1()` does not simulate the transformation process to check if the original array can be sorted through the allowed operations.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
