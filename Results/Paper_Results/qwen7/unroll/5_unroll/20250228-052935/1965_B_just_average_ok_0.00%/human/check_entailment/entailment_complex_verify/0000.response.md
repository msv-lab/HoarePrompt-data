### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its behavior based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to find a sequence `a` of non-negative integers of size at most 25 such that:
  1. No subsequence of `a` has a sum equal to `k`.
  2. For all `1 \le v \le n` where `v \ne k`, there is a subsequence of `a` with a sum of `v`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the Sequence**:
   - A list `nums` is initialized with powers of 2 up to `2^23` (i.e., `[1, 2, 4, ..., 8388608]`).
   - `idx` is determined as the highest index such that \(1 << idx \leq k\).
   - `nums` is modified to include `k - nums[idx]`, `k + 1`, and `k + nums[idx] + 1`.
   - `1 << idx` is removed from `nums`.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of `nums` (which is always 3) is printed.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

#### Annotations Recap:
- The final state of `nums` for each test case will be `[k - (1 << (idx-1)), k + 1, k + (1 << (idx-1)) + 1]`.
- The length of `nums` is always 3.

#### Verification Against Requirements:
1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**:
   - The sequence includes `k + 1` and `k + (1 << (idx-1)) + 1`, which ensures that no subsequence can sum to `k` because the smallest possible sum involving `k + 1` or `k + (1 << (idx-1)) + 1` would be larger than `k`.

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from `1` to `n` Except `k`**:
   - The sequence includes `1 << i` for `0 \le i < 24`, which covers all sums from `1` to `2^23`.
   - By including `k - (1 << (idx-1))`, `k + 1`, and `k + (1 << (idx-1)) + 1`, the program ensures that all values from `1` to `n` (except `k`) can be formed by combining these elements.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly generates a sequence that meets the required conditions for all test cases. The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program fails to meet the requirements, which is not true based on the provided logic and annotations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided annotations.
