Output State: The number of elements in `nums` list and the elements themselves will vary based on the input values of `n` and `k` for each test case. For each test case, the `nums` list will contain exactly 5 elements: three fixed values (1, 2, and 4, which are the first three powers of 2), the value of `k - 2^idx`, and `k + 1` or `k + 2^idx + 1` depending on the value of `k` relative to the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. The `1 << idx` value is removed from the list. The length of the `nums` list will be 5 for each test case.
