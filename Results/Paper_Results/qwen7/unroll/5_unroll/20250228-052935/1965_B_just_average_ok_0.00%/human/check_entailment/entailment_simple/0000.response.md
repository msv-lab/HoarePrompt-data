### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading `n` and `k`.

2. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs a list `nums` with initially 24 elements, which are powers of 2 (`1 << i` for `i` in range 0 to 23).
   - It then identifies the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k` and removes this value from `nums`.
   - It appends `k - (1 << idx)`, `k + 1`, and `k + (1 << idx) + 1` to `nums`. Here, `idx` is the index of the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`.

3. **Output**:
   - The length of `nums` is printed, which is always 3 after the modifications.
   - The elements of `nums` are printed.

4. **Conditions**:
   - **No Subsequence Summing to `k`**: The constructed sequence ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because the elements added to `nums` do not include `k` itself, and the sequence includes values that prevent any subsequence from summing to `k`.
   - **Subsequences Summing to All Other Values**: The sequence includes values that allow subsequences to sum to all integers from 1 to `n` except `k`. Specifically, the sequence includes `k - (1 << idx)`, `k + 1`, and `k + (1 << idx) + 1`, ensuring that all required sums can be formed.

5. **Constraints**:
   - The sequence length is always 3, which is within the allowed maximum of 25.
   - The values in the sequence are within the specified bounds.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies the given conditions for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
