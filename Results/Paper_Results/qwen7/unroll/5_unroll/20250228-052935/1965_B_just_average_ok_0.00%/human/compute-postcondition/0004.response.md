Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers t, n, and k. For each test case, it checks if t is within the range 1 to 1000 and if n and k are within their respective valid ranges. It then constructs a list `nums` containing three specific values based on the value of k and prints the length of this list followed by the list itself. The final state of the program after processing all test cases is that it outputs the number of elements in `nums` (which is always 3) and the elements themselves for each test case.**
