N and M are integers such that 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of N strings, each string contains M characters. The field contains goals for two teams (RG for red goal, BG for blue goal), players (R0-R9 for red team, B0-B9 for blue team), a single Quaffle (.Q), and optionally one Bludger (.B). The field description is consistent with the rules provided. T is an integer such that 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000, representing the number of steps in the game. Each step is described by an action involving an entity (a player or a ball) and the action itself (moving up, down, left, right, catching, or throwing).
