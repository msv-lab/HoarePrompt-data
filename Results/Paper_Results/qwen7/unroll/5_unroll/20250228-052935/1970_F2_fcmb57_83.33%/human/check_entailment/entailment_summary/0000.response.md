Reasoning:  
The provided program seems to follow the problem description closely. Here are the key points to verify:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the dimensions of the field and initializes dictionaries to store the positions of players and goals. It also sets up the initial position of the Quaffle and processes the movements and actions of the players and balls.

2. **Movement Handling**: The program correctly handles player movements using the `func_1` function, which updates the player's position based on the direction specified. This function appears to be implemented correctly.

3. **Ball Handling**: The program correctly handles catching and throwing the Quaffle. When a player catches the Quaffle, the Quaffle's position is updated to the player's position. When a player throws the Quaffle, the Quaffle is released, and its position is set to an empty string.

4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly identifies when a player scores a goal and prints the appropriate message. It also updates the score accordingly. If a player scores in their own goal, the opposing team gets a point.

5. **Elimination Logic**: The program correctly identifies when a player is eliminated due to a Bludger and prints the appropriate message. Players are eliminated alphabetically if multiple players are eliminated simultaneously.

6. **Final Score**: The program correctly prints the final score at the end of the game.

Given these observations, the provided code appears to implement the logic correctly based on the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
