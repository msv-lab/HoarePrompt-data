You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's recall that an increasing subsequence of the array a is a sequence that
can be obtained from it by removing some elements without changing the order
of the remaining elements, and the remaining elements are strictly increasing
(i. e a_{b_1} < a_{b_2} < \dots < a_{b_k} and b_1 < b_2 < \dots < b_k ). Note
that an empty subsequence is also increasing.

You are given a positive integer X . Your task is to find an array of integers
of length at most 200 , such that it has exactly X increasing subsequences, or
report that there is no such array. If there are several answers, you can
print any of them.

If two subsequences consist of the same elements, but correspond to different
positions in the array, they are considered different (for example, the array
[2, 2] has two different subsequences equal to [2] ).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer X (2 \le X \le
10^{18} ).

Output

For each query, print the answer to it. If it is impossible to find the
required array, print -1 on the first line. Otherwise, print a positive
integer n on the first line — the length of the array. On the second line,
print n integers — the required array itself. If there are several answers,
you can print any of them. All elements of the array should be in the range
[-10^9; 10^9] .

    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to -1. Given that `sequence` is not specified, we use the default value of 0, so the loop runs from 0 down to -1. However, since the loop starts from 0 and goes down, the first iteration sets `i` to 0. 
    #
    #For `i = 0`:
    #- `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which is 1.
    #- `value` is calculated as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` which simplifies to `(1 << 2) - (1 << 0)` or `4 - 1` which equals 3.
    #- The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` checks if `8 - 1` (which is 7) is less than or equal to `number`. If `number` is greater than or equal to 7, `size` is incremented to 2 and `value` becomes 4. But regardless of `number`, the `if` condition `value <= number` will always be true for `value = 3` when `i = 0`, so `size_overlap` is set to `(1, 0)` and the loop breaks. Since no other iterations change this, the final state is `size_overlap` is (1, 0).
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: size_overlap is (1, 0), sequence is (1, 2, 3, ..., size-1)
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append values to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly generate an array with the specified number of increasing subsequences. Specifically, the function `func_1` seems to be designed to generate a sequence based on a binary representation of the input number `n`, but it does not ensure that the generated sequence will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `X = 37`

The expected output for this case would be an array that has exactly 37 increasing subsequences. However, the provided code does not guarantee this. For instance, the sequence generated might not meet the requirement of having exactly 37 increasing subsequences. A more appropriate approach would involve generating a sequence where the number of increasing subsequences can be precisely controlled, such as using a sequence with repeated elements in a specific pattern.

Since the provided code does not ensure that the generated array will have exactly `X` increasing subsequences for all valid inputs, the program is incorrect.
