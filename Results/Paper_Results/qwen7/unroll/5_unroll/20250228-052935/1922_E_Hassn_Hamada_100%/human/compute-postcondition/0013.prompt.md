You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9].
def func_1(number, sequence):
    """
    Generates a sequence of numbers based on the input number.

    Args:
        number (int): The input number to generate sequence for
        sequence (List[int]): The output sequence 
    """
    if (number == 0) :
        return 0, 0
        #The program returns two values, both of which are 0.
    #State: number is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and sequence is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. The value of number is not 0
    size_overlap = 0, 0
    for i in range(max(sequence, default=0), -1, -1):
        size, value = i + 1, (1 << i + 1) - (1 << i)
        
        while (1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number:
            size += 1
            value = (1 << size) - (1 << i)
        
        if value <= number:
            size_overlap = size, i
            break
        
    #State: Output State: size_overlap is (1, 0)
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to -1. Given that `sequence` is not specified, we use the default value of 0, so the loop runs from 0 down to -1. However, since the loop starts from 0 and goes down, the first iteration sets `i` to 0. 
    #
    #For `i = 0`:
    #- `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which is 1.
    #- `value` is calculated as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` which simplifies to `(1 << 2) - (1 << 0)` or `4 - 1` which equals 3.
    #- The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` checks if `8 - 1` (which is 7) is less than or equal to `number`. If `number` is greater than or equal to 7, `size` is incremented to 2 and `value` becomes 4. But regardless of `number`, the `if` condition `value <= number` will always be true for `value = 3` when `i = 0`, so `size_overlap` is set to `(1, 0)` and the loop breaks. Since no other iterations change this, the final state is `size_overlap` is (1, 0).
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: size_overlap is (1, 0), sequence is (1, 2, 3, ..., size-1)
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `number`, which is a positive integer such that 2 <= number <= 10^18, and a parameter `sequence`, which is a list of integers where all elements are in the range [-10^9, 10^9]. After executing the function body, the function returns two values, both of which are 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns two values, both of which are 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
