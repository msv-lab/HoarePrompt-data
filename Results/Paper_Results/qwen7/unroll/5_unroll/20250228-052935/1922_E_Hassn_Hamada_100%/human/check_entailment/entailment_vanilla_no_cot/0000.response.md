Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence based on the input number, but it does not correctly generate an array with the exact number of increasing subsequences as specified by the problem. The logic inside `func_1` is complex and seems to be trying to generate a sequence based on binary representation, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

2. **Output Format**: The program prints the length of the generated sequence followed by the sequence itself. However, the sequence generated does not necessarily have exactly `X` increasing subsequences. For instance, the example outputs do not match the expected number of increasing subsequences for the given `X`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when `X` is very large or when it is not possible to construct an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences.

To correctly solve this problem, one would need to generate an array whose number of increasing subsequences matches the given `X`. This typically involves understanding the combinatorial properties of increasing subsequences and constructing the array accordingly. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.
