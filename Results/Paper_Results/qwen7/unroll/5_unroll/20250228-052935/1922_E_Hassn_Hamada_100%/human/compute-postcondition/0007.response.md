Output State: size_overlap is (1, 0)

Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to -1. Given that `sequence` is not specified, we use the default value of 0, so the loop runs from 0 down to -1. However, since the loop starts from 0 and goes down, the first iteration sets `i` to 0. 

For `i = 0`:
- `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which is 1.
- `value` is calculated as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` which simplifies to `(1 << 2) - (1 << 0)` or `4 - 1` which equals 3.
- The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` checks if `8 - 1` (which is 7) is less than or equal to `number`. If `number` is greater than or equal to 7, `size` is incremented to 2 and `value` becomes 4. But regardless of `number`, the `if` condition `value <= number` will always be true for `value = 3` when `i = 0`, so `size_overlap` is set to `(1, 0)` and the loop breaks. Since no other iterations change this, the final state is `size_overlap` is (1, 0).
