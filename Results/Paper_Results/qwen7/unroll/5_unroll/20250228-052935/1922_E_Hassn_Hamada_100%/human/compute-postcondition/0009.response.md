Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `size - overlap`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `size_overlap` is given as `(1, 0)`.
   - The loop uses `size - overlap`, so we need to identify what `size` and `overlap` are from `size_overlap`.

3. **Understand the structure of `size_overlap`**: Since `size_overlap` is given as `(1, 0)`, we can assume that `size_overlap` is a tuple where the first element is `size` and the second element is `overlap`. Therefore, `size = 1` and `overlap = 0`.

4. **Calculate the range for the loop**: The loop runs for `range(size - overlap)`. Substituting the values, we get `range(1 - 0)`, which simplifies to `range(1)`.

5. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: When the loop starts, `i` will be set to 0 (the starting value of the range function).

6. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `size` and `overlap` are correctly set to their respective values from `size_overlap`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 0), `i` is 0**
