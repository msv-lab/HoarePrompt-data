Output State: **`size_overlap` is (1, 0); `sequence` is (1, 2, 3, ..., size-1); `number` is `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`. Given the initial state, `size` is 1 and `overlap` is 0. Therefore, the expression simplifies to `number - (1 << 1) + (1 << 0)`, which further simplifies to `number - 2 + 1` or `number - 1`. The `sequence` and `size_overlap` remain unchanged from their initial states.
