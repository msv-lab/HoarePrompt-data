### Reasoning:

Let's systematically evaluate the provided program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

#### Input Handling:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case by reading the desired number of increasing subsequences (`n`).

#### Function `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers such that the total number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is exactly `n`.
- The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence by leveraging powers of 2, which is a known method to achieve specific counts of increasing subsequences.

#### Recursive Logic:
- The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value to 0.
- It calculates the size and value based on powers of 2.
- It checks if the current value can be used to form the required number of increasing subsequences.
- If the value is less than or equal to the remaining number, it updates the `(size, overlap)` tuple and breaks out of the loop.
- It then appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated number.

#### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning an empty sequence, which is correct.
- It also handles the case where `n` is 1 by returning a sequence of length 1, which is correct.
- For larger values of `n`, the recursive function should correctly generate the sequence.

#### Output Format:
- The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself, which matches the problem requirements.

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns `(0, 0)`. This is correct because an empty sequence has exactly 1 increasing subsequence (the empty subsequence).

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum value in the sequence (defaulting to 0) to 0.
   - It calculates the size and value based on powers of 2.
   - It checks if the current value can be used to form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - If the value is less than or equal to the remaining number, it updates the `(size, overlap)` tuple and breaks out of the loop.
   - It then appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated number.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The sequence is constructed by appending values based on the calculated `(size, overlap)` tuple.
   - The sequence is built such that it results in exactly `n` increasing subsequences.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles small values of `n` (e.g., 2, 5, 13, 37) by generating appropriate sequences.
   - For larger values, the recursive function ensures that the sequence is constructed correctly.

#### Testing and Validation:
- We can test the program with various inputs, including edge cases like `n = 2, 5, 13, 37`, and verify if the generated sequences have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program follows the correct logic to generate sequences with the desired number of increasing subsequences. The recursive approach and the use of powers of 2 seem appropriate for this problem.

### Final Answer:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
