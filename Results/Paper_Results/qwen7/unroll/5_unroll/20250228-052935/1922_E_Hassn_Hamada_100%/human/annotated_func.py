    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over the range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to -1. Given that `sequence` is not specified, we use the default value of 0, so the loop runs from 0 down to -1. However, since the loop starts from 0 and goes down, the first iteration sets `i` to 0. 
    #
    #For `i = 0`:
    #- `size` is calculated as `i + 1`, which is 1.
    #- `value` is calculated as `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` which simplifies to `(1 << 2) - (1 << 0)` or `4 - 1` which equals 3.
    #- The condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` checks if `8 - 1` (which is 7) is less than or equal to `number`. If `number` is greater than or equal to 7, `size` is incremented to 2 and `value` becomes 4. But regardless of `number`, the `if` condition `value <= number` will always be true for `value = 3` when `i = 0`, so `size_overlap` is set to `(1, 0)` and the loop breaks. Since no other iterations change this, the final state is `size_overlap` is (1, 0).
    size, overlap = size_overlap
    for i in range(size - overlap):
        sequence.append(i + overlap)
        
    #State: size_overlap is (1, 0), sequence is (1, 2, 3, ..., size-1)
    func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append values to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros.
