The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `number` (where \(2 \leq number \leq 10^{18}\)) and a list of integers `sequence`. It generates a sequence based on `number` and modifies `sequence` accordingly. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append values to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with a modified `number` and the updated `sequence`. The function ultimately returns two zeros.
