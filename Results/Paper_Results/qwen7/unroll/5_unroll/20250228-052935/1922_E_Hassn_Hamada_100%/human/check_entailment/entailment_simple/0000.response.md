Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of integers such that the number of increasing subsequences in the sequence is equal to the input `number`.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The key logic involves setting up the sequence with a specific pattern to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Base Case**:
   - When `number == 0`, the function returns immediately, indicating the base case for the recursion.

3. **Loop and Recursive Calls**:
   - The loop iterates backward from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `size` and `value` based on powers of 2.
   - It then checks if the current `value` can be subtracted from `number` without violating the constraints.
   - If the condition is met, it updates `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The function then recursively calls itself with the updated `number` and appends the appropriate values to the sequence.

4. **Recursive Call**:
   - The recursive call adjusts `number` by subtracting the calculated `value` and continues building the sequence.

5. **Sequence Construction**:
   - After determining the necessary values, the sequence is constructed by appending the appropriate values based on the calculated `size` and `overlap`.

6. **Output**:
   - The length of the sequence is printed first, followed by the sequence itself.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly generates a sequence that meets the requirement of having exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The logic and structure of the function align with the problem's constraints and requirements.

Correctness: **True**
