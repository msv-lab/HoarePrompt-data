Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`test_cases`).
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n` which represents the desired number of increasing subsequences.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input number.
   - It uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.
   - The function maintains a tuple `(size, overlap)` which helps in determining the next element to add to the sequence.

3. **Recursive Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value to 0.
   - It calculates the size and value based on powers of 2.
   - It checks if the current value can be used to form the required number of increasing subsequences.
   - If the value is less than or equal to the remaining number, it updates the `(size, overlap)` tuple and breaks out of the loop.
   - It then appends the calculated values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated number.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - After generating the sequence, the program prints the length of the sequence.
   - It then prints the sequence itself.

### Verification Against Problem Description:

1. **Correctness of Sequence Generation**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to generate a sequence that results in exactly `n` increasing subsequences.
   - The logic seems to correctly handle the generation of sequences using powers of 2, which is a known method to achieve specific counts of increasing subsequences.
   - However, the implementation details need to be verified for edge cases and correctness.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `n` is 0 by returning an empty sequence, which is correct.
   - It also handles the case where `n` is 1 by returning a sequence of length 1, which is correct.
   - For larger values of `n`, the recursive function should correctly generate the sequence.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the length of the sequence followed by the sequence itself, which matches the problem requirements.

### Testing and Validation:

To validate the correctness, we can test the program with various inputs, including edge cases like `n = 2, 5, 13, 37`, and verify if the generated sequences have the correct number of increasing subsequences.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic to generate sequences with the desired number of increasing subsequences. The recursive approach and the use of powers of 2 seem appropriate for this problem.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
