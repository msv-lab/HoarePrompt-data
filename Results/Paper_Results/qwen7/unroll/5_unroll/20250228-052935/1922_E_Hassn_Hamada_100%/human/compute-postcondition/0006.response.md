Output State: size_overlap is (0, 0).

Explanation: The loop iterates over a range from the maximum value of `sequence` (which is not provided) down to 0. Inside the loop, it calculates `size` and `value` based on the current iteration index `i`. However, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` always fails for any positive value of `number` because `size` starts from a small value and increases, but the left side of the inequality grows exponentially while the right side remains constant. Therefore, the `break` statement is never reached, and the `size_overlap` variable remains unchanged at its initial value of (0, 0).
