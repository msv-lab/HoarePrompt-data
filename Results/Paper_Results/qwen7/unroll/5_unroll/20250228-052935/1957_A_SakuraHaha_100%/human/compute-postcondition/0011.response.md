Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter t, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each test case, it also accepts an integer n, which is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and a list of stick lengths a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where each stick length a_i is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. The function does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

This means the function `func_1` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, followed by for each test case, an integer `n` indicating the number of sticks, and a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of the sticks. The function processes this input but does not return any specific value based on the provided information.
