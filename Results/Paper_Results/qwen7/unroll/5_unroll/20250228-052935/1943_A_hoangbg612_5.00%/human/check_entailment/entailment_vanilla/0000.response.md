Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score according to the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `S` and the elements of the array `N`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements doesn't affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to track the current maximum value in the sequence.
   - `M` is a dictionary that will keep track of how many times each number appears in the sequence.

4. **Building the Sequence:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` and the variable `cur` based on the following rules:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is greater than `cur + 1`. If so, it breaks out of the loop and increments `cur` by 1.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments the count in `M` for that number.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - The program checks if the sum of counts in `M` equals the size of the array `S`. If true, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` to find the smallest integer that is not present in `M`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Logic for Building the Sequence:**
   - The logic for building the sequence is flawed. The program attempts to build a sequence where each number is strictly greater than the previous one, which is not necessary for finding the MEX.
   - The program should focus on ensuring that the sequence avoids gaps up to the point where it can no longer do so without violating the rules.

2. **Incorrect Final MEX Calculation:**
   - The final MEX calculation assumes that the sequence is built optimally, but the logic for building the sequence is incorrect.
   - The program should instead focus on ensuring that the sequence avoids gaps up to the point where it can no longer do so without violating the rules.

### Correct Approach:
- Alice and Bob play optimally, meaning Alice will always pick the smallest available number to maximize the MEX, and Bob will pick the next smallest available number to minimize the MEX.
- The optimal strategy involves ensuring that the sequence avoids gaps up to the point where it can no longer do so without violating the rules.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the game's final score. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
