Output State: **`T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2⋅10^4.**

The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the same condition applies to `T` after the code is executed. The values of the arrays and their sizes are not yet known because no further input has been processed.
