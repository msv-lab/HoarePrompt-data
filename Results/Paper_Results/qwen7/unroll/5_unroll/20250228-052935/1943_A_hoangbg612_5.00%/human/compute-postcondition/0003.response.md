Output State: `T` is an integer obtained from `int(input())`, and it is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `T` ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each value of `S` and list `N`, after executing the loop, `cur` is the maximum number such that there are at least `cur+1` numbers in `N` that are greater than or equal to `cur`.
