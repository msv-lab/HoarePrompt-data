Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the size of an array `a`, followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is in the range [0, n-1]. For each test case, it returns information about the array based on the given constraints.**

This means the function takes in a series of inputs where each input starts with an integer `n` indicating the size of an array, followed by `n` integers. The function processes these arrays according to the given constraints and returns relevant information for each test case.
