Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Hereâ€™s why it fails:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice aims to maximize the MEX of the array `c`. The program does not ensure that Alice always picks the smallest available number that maximizes the MEX. Instead, it sorts the array and iterates through it, which does not guarantee optimal play for Alice.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob aims to minimize the MEX of the array `c`. The program does not ensure that Bob always picks the smallest available number that minimizes the MEX. Sorting the array and iterating through it also does not guarantee optimal play for Bob.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```
The output of the provided program is:
```
2
1
0
```

However, let's analyze the first test case `0 0 1 1` more closely:
- If Alice picks `1`, then `a = [0, 0]` and `c = [1]`.
- If Bob picks `0`, then `a = []` and `c = [1, 0]`.
- The MEX of `[1, 0]` is `2`.

But if Alice picks `0` first, then:
- `a = [0, 1]` and `c = [0]`.
- If Bob picks `1`, then `a = []` and `c = [0, 1]`.
- The MEX of `[0, 1]` is `2`.

In this scenario, Alice picking `0` first results in a higher MEX value than picking `1` first. Therefore, the program does not handle the optimal strategy for Alice, leading to incorrect results.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the optimal strategies for both players and hence is incorrect.
