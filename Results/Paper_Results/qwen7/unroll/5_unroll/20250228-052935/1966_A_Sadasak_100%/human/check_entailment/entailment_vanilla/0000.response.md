Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Condition Check:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This condition is straightforward and correct because if `k` is greater than `n`, no exchanges can be made, and thus the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers.
   - `func_1` updates the frequency of each card number to ensure no frequency exceeds `k`.

4. **Checking Frequency Table:**
   - The program checks if `k` exists in the frequency table.
     - If `k` exists in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

### Detailed Analysis of `func_1`

- **Function `func_1`:**
  - It creates a frequency table using a dictionary.
  - For each card number, it updates the frequency to ensure it does not exceed `k`.
  - This function ensures that no card type has more than `k` cards, but it does not directly solve the problem of minimizing the number of cards.

### Correctness of the Main Logic

- **Case 1: `k > n`:**
  - The program correctly prints `n` because no exchanges can be made.

- **Case 2: `k <= n`:**
  - The program should minimize the number of cards by ensuring that each card type has at most `k` cards.
  - The logic of checking if `k` exists in the frequency table is flawed. The goal is to find the smallest number of cards that cannot be reduced further by the given operations.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the example provided:

- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `5 3 4 1 1 4 4`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: We can reduce the cards to 2 by exchanging groups of 3 cards.

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `1 10 7`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: No operations can be performed, so the answer is 1.

- **Example 3:**
  - Input: `7 2 4 2 1 100 5 2 3`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: We can reduce the cards to 1 by exchanging groups of 2 cards.

### Conclusion

The current implementation does not correctly minimize the number of cards. The logic in `func_1` and the main logic need adjustments to ensure the correct minimization of cards.

### Corrected Program

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        min_cards = n
        for count in freq.values():
            min_cards -= (count // k) * (k - 1)
        print(min_cards)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table
```

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
