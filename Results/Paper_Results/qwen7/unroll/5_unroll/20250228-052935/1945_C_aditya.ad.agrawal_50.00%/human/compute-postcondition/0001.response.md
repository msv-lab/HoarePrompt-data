The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `t` is non-zero. Given that `t` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute at least once because `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 2⋅10^4**
