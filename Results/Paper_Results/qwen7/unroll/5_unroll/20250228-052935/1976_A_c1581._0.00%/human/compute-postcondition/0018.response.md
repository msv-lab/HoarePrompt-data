The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `password`. `password` is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit. The function does not provide specific conditions to determine the return value, but rather returns 'NO' in two cases and 'YES' in another case. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a password string and return 'YES' under certain unspecified conditions, and 'NO' in other cases.
