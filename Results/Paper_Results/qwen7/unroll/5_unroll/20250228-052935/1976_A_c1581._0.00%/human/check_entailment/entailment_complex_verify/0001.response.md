### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`. This part is correct.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The loop correctly iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each one.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and tracking the last digit index. If such a case is found, it returns "NO". This check is correct.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. However, there is a flaw in the logic here. The function checks if the `digits` and `letters` lists are sorted independently, but it does not ensure that the overall password structure (i.e., no digit after a letter) is maintained.

Let's break down the issues:

- The function correctly identifies if there is a digit after a letter by tracking the last digit index.
- The function correctly sorts the `digits` and `letters` separately.
- However, the function does not ensure that the password structure (no digit after a letter) is maintained after sorting the `digits` and `letters`.

Consider the following example:
- Password: `123abc`
- After separating digits and letters: `digits = ['1', '2', '3']`, `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']`
- After sorting: `digits = ['1', '2', '3']`, `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']`
- Combining them: `123abc` (which is still valid as per the rules)

But consider another example:
- Password: `1abc2`
- After separating digits and letters: `digits = ['1', '2']`, `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']`
- After sorting: `digits = ['1', '2']`, `letters = ['a', 'b', 'c']`
- Combining them: `1abc2` (which is invalid as per the rules because '2' comes after 'c')

The function does not recombine the `digits` and `letters` in a way that maintains the no-digit-after-letter rule. Therefore, the function incorrectly returns "YES" for the password `1abc2`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the required logic because it fails to ensure that the no-digit-after-letter rule is maintained after sorting the `digits` and `letters`.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
**False**
