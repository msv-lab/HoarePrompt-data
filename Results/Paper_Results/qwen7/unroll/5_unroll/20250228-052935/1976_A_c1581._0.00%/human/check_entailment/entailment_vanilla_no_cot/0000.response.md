Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each password according to the rules, and outputs whether each password is strong or not. The function `func_1` checks if the password has no digit after a letter, and if all digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. The main program handles reading the input and formatting the output correctly. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description.
