Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

# Annotated Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    password = data[index + 1]
    index += 2
    results.append(func_1(password))
print('\n'.join(results))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: password is a string consisting of exactly n characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.
def func_1(password):
    digits = []
    letters = []
    for char in password:
        if char.isdigit():
            digits.append(char)
        else:
            letters.append(char)
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string.
    last_digit_index = -1
    for (i, char) in enumerate(password):
        if char.isdigit():
            last_digit_index = i
        elif last_digit_index != -1:
            return 'NO'
        
    #State: Output State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string if there is at least one digit, otherwise it remains -1. If the loop encounters a lowercase letter before any digit, it returns 'NO'.
    if (digits != sorted(digits)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string if there is at least one digit, otherwise it remains -1; the `digits` list is sorted.
    if (letters != sorted(letters)) :
        return 'NO'
        #The program returns 'NO'
    #State: `password` is a string consisting of exactly `n` characters, where each character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit; `digits` is a list containing all the digits from the original `password` string; `letters` is a list containing all the lowercase Latin letters from the original `password` string; `last_digit_index` is the index of the last digit in the `password` string if there is at least one digit, otherwise it remains -1; the `digits` list is sorted; the `letters` list is sorted
    return 'YES'
    #The program returns 'YES'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a password string and checks if it meets specific conditions. It returns 'YES' if the password contains digits and letters that are both sorted in ascending order, and the last digit appears after all the letters. Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
