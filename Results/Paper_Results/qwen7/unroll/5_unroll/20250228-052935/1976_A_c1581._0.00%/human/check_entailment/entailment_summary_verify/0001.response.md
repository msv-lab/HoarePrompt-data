### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`. This part is correct.
2. **Loop Through Test Cases**: The loop correctly iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (`n` and `password`) for each one.
3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It separates the password into digits and letters.
   - It checks if there is any digit that comes after a letter by iterating through the password and tracking the last digit index. If such a case is found, it returns "NO". However, this check is flawed because it only checks for the presence of a digit after a letter, but it does not ensure that all digits come before all letters. For example, the password "123abc" would incorrectly pass the check since there are no letters after any digit.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order. This check is correct.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it returns "YES".

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the function `func_1` has a flaw in its logic for checking the order of digits and letters. Specifically, it does not ensure that all digits come before all letters. Therefore, the function will incorrectly return "YES" for some cases where the password does not meet the requirement.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly verify whether a password meets the specified conditions due to the flaw in the `func_1` function.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
