Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program incorrectly determines the winner based on the sum of the coins in both wallets being even or odd. However, the game's outcome depends on the optimal strategy of the players, not just the parity of the total number of coins.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `1 1`

According to the problem description, if Alice and Bob both play optimally, the game would proceed as follows:

1. Alice chooses not to swap wallets, leaving `a=0` and `b=1`.
2. Bob must also choose not to swap wallets since Alice's wallet is empty, resulting in `a=0` and `b=0`.
3. Alice cannot make a move, so Bob wins.

However, the program incorrectly outputs "Bob" because `(a + b) % 2 == 0`. This is not the correct logic for determining the winner based on the optimal play described in the problem.

Therefore, the program does not correctly handle all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
