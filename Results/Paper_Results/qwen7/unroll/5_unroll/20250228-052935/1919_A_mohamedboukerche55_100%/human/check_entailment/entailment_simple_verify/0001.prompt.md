You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are bored, so they decide to play a game with their wallets.
Alice has a coins in her wallet, while Bob has b coins in his wallet.

Both players take turns playing, with Alice making the first move. In each
turn, the player will perform the following steps in order:

  1. Choose to exchange wallets with their opponent, or to keep their current wallets. 
  2. Remove 1 coin from the player's current wallet. The current wallet cannot have 0 coins before performing this step. 

The player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses. If both Alice and
Bob play optimally, determine who will win the game.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers a and b (1 \le
a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of coins in Alice's and Bob's wallets,
respectively.

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice will win the game, and "Bob" if
Bob will win the game.

Note

In the first test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob must choose to not swap their wallets in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's and Bob's wallets are empty, Alice is unable to make a move. Hence, Bob wins. 

In the second test case, an example of the game is shown below:

  * Alice chooses to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=3 and b=1 . 
  * Bob chooses to swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=1 and b=2 . 
  * Alice chooses to not swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=2 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Bob can only choose to not swap wallets with Alice in step 1 of his move. Now, a=0 and b=1 . 
  * Since Alice's wallet is empty, Alice can only choose to swap wallets with Bob in step 1 of her move. Now, a=0 and b=0 . 
  * Since both Alice's wallet and Bob's wallet are empty, Bob is unable to make a move. Hence, Alice wins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        a = int(list(s.split())[0])
        
        b = int(list(s.split())[1])
        
        if (a + b) % 2 == 0:
            print('Bob')
        else:
            print('Alice')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'Bob' or 'Alice' printed for each line of input provided within the range of `t`. Specifically, 'Bob' will be printed if the sum of `a` and `b` is even, and 'Alice' will be printed if the sum is odd. The exact sequence of 'Bob' and 'Alice' depends on the input values for `a` and `b` for each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads a string `s` which contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - The program splits the string `s` and converts the first and second elements to integers `a` and `b`.
   - This part seems correct as long as the input format is strictly followed.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if `(a + b) % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Bob'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Alice'.

### Problem Description Analysis:

- The game involves two players, Alice and Bob, taking turns to either swap wallets or remove one coin from their current wallet.
- The player who cannot make a valid move loses.
- Both players play optimally.

### Key Insight:

- The key insight here is that the parity (odd or even nature) of the sum of the coins in both wallets determines the winner.
- If the sum of the coins is even, Bob wins because he can always mirror Alice's moves (if Alice removes a coin, Bob can also remove a coin and maintain the even sum).
- If the sum of the coins is odd, Alice wins because she can always force the sum to become even after her move, leaving Bob in a losing position.

### Verification:

- The given program correctly checks the parity of the sum of `a` and `b`.
- It prints 'Bob' if the sum is even and 'Alice' if the sum is odd, which aligns with the optimal strategy analysis.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the sum of coins in both wallets.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
