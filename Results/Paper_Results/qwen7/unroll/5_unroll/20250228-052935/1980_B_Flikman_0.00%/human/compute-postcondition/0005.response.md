Functionality: **The function processes up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). It then determines whether there are at least \( k \) elements in \( a \) that are greater than the element at index \( f-1 \), or if the number of elements equal to the element at index \( f-1 \) plus the number of elements greater than it is less than or equal to \( k \). Based on this determination, it prints either 'YES', 'NO', or 'MAYBE'. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the results for each case.**
