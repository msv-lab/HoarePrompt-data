Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
3. It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values shown on the cubes.
4. The program calculates the count of cubes with the same value as the favorite cube (`same_value_count`) and the count of cubes with values greater than the favorite cube (`greater_count`).
5. Based on these counts, the program determines whether the favorite cube will definitely be removed (`greater_count >= k`), definitely not be removed (`greater_count + same_value_count <= k`), or may be removed depending on the counts (`else` block).

Given the logic and the conditions checked in the program, it accurately follows the problem statement and handles all possible scenarios as described. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
