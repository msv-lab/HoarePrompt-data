### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array equal to zero by performing a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing three elements: \(a_{i-1}\), \(a_i\), and \(a_{i+1}\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are non-zero.
   - If any element is zero, it returns `False`.
   - If all elements are non-zero, it returns `True`.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operation.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to \(n-2\).
   - For each element \(a_i\) where \(a_i > 1\) and both \(a_{i-1} > 0\) and \(a_{i+1} > 0\), it performs the operation.
   - If at any point \(a_{i-1}\) becomes non-zero after the operation, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero.
   - If `func_1` returns `True`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly implements the operation and checks if it can reduce the array to all zeros.
   - The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements are non-zero.
   - The overall approach in `func_2` ensures that if the array can be reduced to all zeros, it will print "YES"; otherwise, it will print "NO".

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided examples cover various scenarios, including arrays that can be reduced to all zeros and those that cannot.
   - The implementation handles edge cases like arrays with zeros initially or arrays that cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operation. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
