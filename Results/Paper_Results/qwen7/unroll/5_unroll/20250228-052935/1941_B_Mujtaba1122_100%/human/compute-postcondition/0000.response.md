Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop `for i in range(1, n - 1):` will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `list` (representing the array `a`) is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 1.
   - The loop will continue as long as `i < n - 1`. Therefore, `i` should be less than `n - 1` but at least 1.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 1 and `i` is less than `n - 1` when the loop starts.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `i` initialized to 1 and `i` being within the valid range for the loop to iterate through.
