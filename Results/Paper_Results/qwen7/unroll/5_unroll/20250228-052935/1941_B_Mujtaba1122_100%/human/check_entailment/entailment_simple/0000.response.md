### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if we can make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations.
   - The operations involve choosing an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and performing the following assignments:
     - \(a_{i-1} = a_{i-1} - 1\)
     - \(a_i = a_i - 2\)
     - \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+1} - 1\)

2. **Analysis of Provided Code:**
   - The code reads input and calls two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are non-zero, which is incorrect for our problem since we want to check if we can make all elements zero.
   - `func_2` attempts to reduce the array elements to zero using the specified operations. However, the logic in `func_2` is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the operations and instead performs a different set of operations.

3. **Flaws in `func_2`:**
   - The while loop in `func_2` incorrectly updates the list elements. It should be designed to perform the exact operations as described but the current implementation does not do so.
   - The condition `list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and list[i + 1] > 0` is not sufficient to ensure the correct reduction of elements.
   - The operations inside the while loop do not accurately reflect the problem's requirements.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not work as intended, leading to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not correctly simulate the operations required to make all elements of the array zero.
