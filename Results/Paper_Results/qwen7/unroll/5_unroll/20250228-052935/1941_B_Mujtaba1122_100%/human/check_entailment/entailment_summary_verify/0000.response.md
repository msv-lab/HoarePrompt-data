### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summaries to evaluate the correctness of the solution.

#### Function 1 (`func_1`):
This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. This is a straightforward check and is used correctly in the final decision-making process.

#### Function 2 (`func_2`):
This function attempts to reduce the array according to the specified operations. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Operation Application**: The operation described in the problem statement involves subtracting values from neighboring elements, but the current implementation does not correctly apply these operations. Specifically, the operation `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]` is incorrect; it should be `list[i + 1] -= list[i - 1]`.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases correctly. For instance, if an element `list[i]` is greater than 1 and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, the operation should be applied. However, the current implementation does not ensure that the operation is applied correctly and may lead to incorrect results.

3. **Sum Check**: The original assessment correctly points out that the program does not check if the sum of the array elements is even, which is a necessary condition for making all elements zero. The sum of the array elements must be even because each operation reduces three elements by a total of 4 units (1 + 2 + 1).

4. **Final Decision**: The function calls `func_1` at the end to check if all elements are zero, but this is only done after the loop completes. If the loop completes without printing "no," it means the array can potentially be reduced to all zeros, but this is not always true due to the issues mentioned above.

Given these issues, the current implementation is not correct and will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements of the array can be made zero using the specified operations. The issues include incorrect operation application, handling of edge cases, and missing necessary checks. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
