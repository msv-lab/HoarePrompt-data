### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.
   
2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` can be reduced to zero using the allowed operations.
   - If `list[i]` is greater than 1, and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is designed to ensure that if the operations can make all elements zero, it will do so.
   - The operations are applied in a way that ensures the reduction of elements in a controlled manner.
   - The function correctly handles the conditions under which the operations can be performed and checks if the final state of the list is all zeros.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in `func_2`, the function should correctly determine whether it's possible to make all elements of the array zero.

### Correctness:
**True**

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the logic implemented in `func_2`.
