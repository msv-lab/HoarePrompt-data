Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

    5
    
    1 3 5 5 2
    
    5
    
    2 4 4 5 1

    3
    
    7 1 0
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    NO
    NO
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    l = input()
    lst = list(map(int, l.split()))
    func_2(lst, n)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of integers and an integer representing the number of elements in the list. It checks whether all elements in the list are non-zero. If any element is zero, the function returns False immediately. Otherwise, it completes its execution and returns True, indicating that all elements in the list are non-zero.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It modifies the list according to specific rules within a loop. For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively setting it to 0). If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the function prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the function calls `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, the function prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is the result of all these operations.
