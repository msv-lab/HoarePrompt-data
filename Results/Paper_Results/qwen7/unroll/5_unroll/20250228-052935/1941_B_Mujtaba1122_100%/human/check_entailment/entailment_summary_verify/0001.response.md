### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function checks if all elements in the list are zero. It returns `True` if all elements are zero and `False` otherwise.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function iterates through the list from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `list[i]` can be reduced to zero using the allowed operations.
   - If `list[i]` is greater than 1, and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i+1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i-1]`
     - `list[i-1] -= 1 * list[i-1]`
   - If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero after performing the operation, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements in the list are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The logic in `func_2` is designed to ensure that if the operations can make all elements zero, it will do so.
   - The operations are applied in a way that ensures the reduction of elements in a controlled manner.
   - The function correctly handles the conditions under which the operations can be performed and checks if the final state of the list is all zeros.

However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the operations within `func_2`. Specifically, the operations are not being applied in a way that guarantees the possibility of reducing all elements to zero. The issue lies in the way the operations are applied and the conditions under which they are performed.

- **Issue with Operations**: The operations are only applied when `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`. This means that if an element is reduced to 1, it cannot be further reduced because the condition `list[i] > 1` will no longer be satisfied. However, an element that is reduced to 1 might still need to be reduced to zero, which is not possible with the current logic.

- **Example Counterexample**: Consider the array `[1, 1, 1, 1]`. According to the operations, we cannot reduce any element to zero because none of them satisfy the condition `list[i] > 1` initially, and once they are reduced to 1, they cannot be reduced further.

Given this analysis, the function `func_2` does not correctly handle the scenario where elements are reduced to 1 but cannot be further reduced to zero. Therefore, the function may incorrectly print 'YES' for arrays that cannot actually be reduced to all zeros.
