Postcondition: **The list has been modified according to the rules inside the loop. For each element `list[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1] > 0` and `list[i+1] > 0`, then `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively setting it to 0). If at any point during these operations `list[i-1]` is not zero, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the final state of the list is the result of all these operations. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `True`.**
