Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Operations**: The `func_2` function does not correctly simulate the operations defined in the problem statement. Specifically, it incorrectly modifies the array elements without following the exact rules stated. For example, it subtracts `list[i-1]` from `list[i+1]`, which is not allowed according to the problem statement.

2. **Logic Flaw in Operation Application**: The logic for applying the operation is flawed. The operation should only be applied when `a_{i-1} > 0`, `a_i > 1`, and `a_{i+1} > 0`. The current implementation does not check these conditions properly.

3. **Output Logic**: The function prints 'no' and returns immediately after finding any non-zero element in the middle of the array, which is not the correct approach. It should continue checking until the end of the array.

4. **Final Check**: The final check using `func_1` is unnecessary and incorrect because it does not account for the operations being applied correctly.

A correct solution would involve ensuring that the operations are applied correctly and checking if it's possible to reduce all elements to zero. Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
def can_make_zero(t, cases):
    for case in cases:
        n = case[0]
        a = case[1]
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(a) % 2 != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the minimum value in the array is non-positive
        min_val = min(a)
        if min_val < 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the maximum value minus the minimum value is even
        max_val = max(a)
        if (max_val - min_val) % 2 != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        print("YES")

# Example usage
t = int(input().strip())
cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    cases.append((n, a))

can_make_zero(t, cases)
```

This version checks the necessary conditions to determine if it's possible to make all elements zero, without incorrectly modifying the array elements.
