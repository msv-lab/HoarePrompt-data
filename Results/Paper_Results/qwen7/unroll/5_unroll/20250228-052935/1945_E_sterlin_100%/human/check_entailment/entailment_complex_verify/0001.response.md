### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not contain the required logic to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and verify the program against the problem description and the annotated version.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Missing Binary Search Implementation**: The program does not implement the binary search algorithm.
2. **Missing Rearrangement Logic**: The program does not include the logic to rearrange the permutation using at most 2 swaps.
3. **Helper Functions Not Used**: The helper functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are not utilized in the main logic.

#### Analysis Using Annotated Code:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `x`, and the permutation `p`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - A dictionary `num_indx` is created to map each number in the permutation to its index.
   - A list `seen` is initialized to keep track of visited elements during the binary search.

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The binary search is performed, but the logic to ensure `p[l] == x` after the search is missing.
   - The program checks if `p[left] == x` directly without ensuring the correct placement through swaps.

4. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program attempts to swap elements to ensure `p[left] == x` if needed.
   - However, the logic to handle the case where `x` is not initially at the correct position is flawed.

#### Detailed Evaluation:
- **Case 1**: If `p[left] == x`, the program prints `0` indicating no swaps are needed.
- **Case 2**: If `x` is not in the permutation, the program prints `1` and swaps `left` with the index of `x`.
- **Case 3**: If `x` is present but not at the correct position, the program attempts to swap `left` with another index to ensure `p[left] == x`.

However, the logic to handle the third case is incomplete and may not always work as intended. The program does not guarantee that exactly 2 swaps will be made, and the logic to handle the second swap is not robust.

Given the above analysis, the program does not fully implement the required logic to solve the problem correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
