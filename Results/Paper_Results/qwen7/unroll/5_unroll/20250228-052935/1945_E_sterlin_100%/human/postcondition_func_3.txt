The function accepts no parameters and returns a tuple containing four elements: an integer `t`, an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list `p` representing a permutation of size `n`. The integer `t` satisfies \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \times 10^4\), and each test case consists of two integers `n` and `x` such that \(1 \leq x \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), along with a permutation `p` of size `n` consisting of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
