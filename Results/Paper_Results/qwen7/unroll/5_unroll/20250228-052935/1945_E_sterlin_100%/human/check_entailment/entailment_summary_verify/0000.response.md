### Reasoning:

The original assessment is **False**, and the reasoning provided is accurate. The program indeed does not contain any implementation of the required functionality. Let's break down the problem and verify the original assessment:

1. **Problem Description**: The task requires rearranging a permutation with at most 2 swaps to ensure that `p_l` equals `x` after performing a binary search.

2. **Program Code**: The program only defines several utility functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) that handle input reading but do not implement the core logic to rearrange the permutation.

3. **Function Summaries**:
   - `func_5`: Processes input data from the user, returning a list of split input strings.
   - Other functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`) are utility functions for reading different types of input.

Given the problem description and the current state of the program, the program does not perform any operations to rearrange the permutation as required. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in stating that the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**

The program is currently incomplete and does not implement the required functionality, thus failing to meet the problem's requirements.
