Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. The functions defined (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`) are placeholders for standard input operations and do not contain the actual solution logic. To solve the problem, you would need to implement the logic to find the correct positions to swap in order to place the target value `x` at the start of the permutation using no more than two swaps. The current implementation does not include this logic.
