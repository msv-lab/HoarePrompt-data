Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the logic inside the inner loop is flawed. The program should check if there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not. However, the current implementation sets `l` to 'YES' only if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` do not match `c[i]` for some index `i`. This is not the correct logic.

Here's the correct logic:
- Initialize `l` to 'YES'.
- For each position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, check if `a[i] == c[i]` or `b[i] == c[i]`.
- If for any `i`, both `a[i] == c[i]` and `b[i] == c[i]` are false, then set `l` to 'NO' and break out of the loop.
- After checking all positions, if `l` is still 'YES', then print 'YES'; otherwise, print 'NO'.

The annotated program incorrectly assumes that if the condition `a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]` is met for any `i`, then `l` should be 'NO'. This is not the correct interpretation of the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
