Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on specific conditions or operations defined within the function body.**

Note: The actual processing and return values are not specified in the given information, so the description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
