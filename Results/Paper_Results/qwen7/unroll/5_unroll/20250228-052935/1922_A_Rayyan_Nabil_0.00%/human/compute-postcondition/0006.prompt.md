You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    l = 'YES'
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:
                l = 'YES'
        else:
            l = 'NO'
        
        print(l)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `l` is 'NO'
    #
    #Explanation: The variable `l` is initialized to 'YES' at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. Inside the inner loop, the condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:` is checked. If this condition is never met for any `i` within the inner loop, then `l` remains 'YES'. However, if the condition is met for any `i`, `l` is set to 'NO' and remains 'NO' for the rest of the outer loop iteration. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot guarantee that the condition will never be met. Therefore, the final value of `l` after all iterations is 'NO', assuming there is at least one `i` where the condition is met.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function processes these inputs and returns different outputs based on specific conditions or operations defined within the function body.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
