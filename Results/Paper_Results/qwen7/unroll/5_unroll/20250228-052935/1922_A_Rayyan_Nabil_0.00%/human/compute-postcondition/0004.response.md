Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `l` is 'NO'

Explanation: The variable `l` is initialized to 'YES' at the start of each iteration of the outer loop. Inside the inner loop, the condition `if a[i] != c[i] and b[i] != c[i]:` is checked. If this condition is never met for any `i` within the inner loop, then `l` remains 'YES'. However, if the condition is met for any `i`, `l` is set to 'NO' and remains 'NO' for the rest of the outer loop iteration. Since the problem does not provide specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, we cannot guarantee that the condition will never be met. Therefore, the final value of `l` after all iterations is 'NO', assuming there is at least one `i` where the condition is met.
