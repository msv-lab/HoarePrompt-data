Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Template Matching Logic**: The program checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are both different from `c[i]` for each position `i`. If this condition holds for any position, it sets `l` to `'YES'`, which is incorrect. According to the problem statement, `a` and `b` should match the template while `c` should not. Therefore, the condition should be checked to see if `a[i]` and `b[i]` match some template character (either equal or different based on the template) while `c[i]` does not match.

2. **Template Construction**: The program does not actually construct or check a template. Instead, it only checks a single condition for each position independently, which is insufficient to determine if a valid template exists.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()

        # Check if there exists a template where a and b match but c does not
        valid_template = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] and b[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
            elif a[i].islower() and b[i].islower() and a[i] == b[i] and a[i] != c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break
            elif a[i].isupper() and b[i].isupper() and a[i].lower() == b[i].lower() and a[i].lower() == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break

        if valid_template:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected program checks if there exists a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not, according to the rules specified in the problem statement.
