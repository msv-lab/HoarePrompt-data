Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number`.

2. **Understand the loop head variables**: The only variables involved in the loop head are `size` and `number`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - The expression `(1 << size + 1) - 1` represents a number that is \(2^{(size + 1)} - 1\).
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `(1 << size + 1) - 1 <= number` must be true.

4. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `size` is 1.
   - `number` is a positive integer.
   - `sequence` is a list of integers where all elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

5. **Calculate the initial value of the loop condition**:
   - When `size` is 1, `(1 << size + 1) - 1` becomes `(1 << 2) - 1 = 3`.
   - Therefore, the condition becomes `3 <= number`.

6. **Determine the necessary adjustment**:
   - Since `number` is a positive integer, it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - The current state of `size` (which is 1) does not need to be adjusted because the condition already holds true with `size` being 1.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `number` to ensure it is at least 3.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`size` is 1, `number` must be at least 3, `sequence` is a list of integers where all elements are within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\)**
