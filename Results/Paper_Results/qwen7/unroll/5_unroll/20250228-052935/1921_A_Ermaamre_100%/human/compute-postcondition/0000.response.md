Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases entered by the user.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input, which represents the number of test cases. This integer is assigned to the variable `t`. All other variables remain unchanged and retain their initial state, which is not specified but implied to be as per the initial conditions given. The value of `t` is now known and will be used to process the subsequent test cases.
