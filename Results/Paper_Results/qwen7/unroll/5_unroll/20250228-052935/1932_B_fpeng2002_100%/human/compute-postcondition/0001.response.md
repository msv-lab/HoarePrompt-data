The only variable in the loop head is `num_tests`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_tests`. For the loop to execute the first time, `num_tests` must be greater than 0.

Given that `num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), it already satisfies the condition to be greater than 0. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `num_tests`.

However, since the problem asks us to provide a modified state, and based on the given format, we should still include the condition in the state description.

State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and `num_tests` must be greater than 0**
