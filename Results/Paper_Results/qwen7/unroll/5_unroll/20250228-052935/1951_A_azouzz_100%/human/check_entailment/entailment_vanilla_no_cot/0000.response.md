Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not match the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python program that generates `.py` files (specifically `ac.py` and `wa.py`) for each `.html` file found in subfolders whose names fall within a specified numeric range. However, the given program `func_1()` instead reads input from the user and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions related to the count of '1's in a string and the presence of '11' in that string. This does not fulfill the requirements of the original problem description.
