Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if a subarray is "good" based on specific conditions.
2. A subarray is considered "good" if there exists another array \( b \) of the same length such that:
   - The sum of elements in both arrays is equal.
   - No element in \( a \) is equal to its corresponding element in \( b \).
   - All elements in \( b \) are positive.
3. The provided solution calculates the cumulative sums and counts of 1s in the subarray to check the conditions for being "good".
4. The logic in the code:
   - Computes the cumulative count of 1s (`ones`) and the modified cumulative sum (`sum`) for the entire array.
   - For each query, it checks if the subarray can be transformed into a "good" subarray by ensuring the conditions are met.
5. The approach correctly uses the properties of cumulative sums and counts to determine if a subarray can be made "good".
6. The code handles the constraints and input/output format as specified in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution appears to be correct and follows the problem's requirements accurately.

Correctness: **True**
