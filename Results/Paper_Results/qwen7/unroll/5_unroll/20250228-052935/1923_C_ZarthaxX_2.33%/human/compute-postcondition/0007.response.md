State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 integers where each element starting from index 1 is the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 integers where each element starting from index 1 is the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value, `q` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not need to be explicitly adjusted.
- The loop runs `q` times, so `q` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The other variables (`t`, `n`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`) are already defined and do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `q` is greater than 0.
