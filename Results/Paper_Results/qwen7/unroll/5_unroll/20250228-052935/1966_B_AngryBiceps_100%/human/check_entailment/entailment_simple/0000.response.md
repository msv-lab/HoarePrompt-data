Reasoning:
1. **Test Cases Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop that iterates `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases.
2. **Grid Initialization**: The grid is correctly initialized with the dimensions `n` and `m`, and the grid is populated with the input strings.
3. **Conditions for 'NO'**:
   - The function checks if the first row and the last row are identical and filled with the same character. If this condition is met, it prints 'NO'.
   - It also checks if the first and last rows have the same unique character but are not identical. If this condition is met, it again prints 'NO'.
4. **Conditions for 'YES'**: If neither of the above conditions is met, the function prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color through the allowed operations.

Given the problem statement and the provided test cases, the function correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. The conditions for 'NO' are correctly identified, and the rest of the cases are handled appropriately to print 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
