The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers up to 500, and each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. It reads the number of test cases, followed by the dimensions and content of each grid. For each grid, it checks if the first and last rows are identical and filled with the same character, or if the first and last rows are different but have uniform characters across them. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on these conditions for each test case.
