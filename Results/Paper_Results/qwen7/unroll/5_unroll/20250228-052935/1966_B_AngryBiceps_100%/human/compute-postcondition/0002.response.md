Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row and last row are identical and filled with the same character, or if the entire grid's first and last rows meet specific conditions where they are different but their characters are uniform across the respective rows, it will print 'NO'. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'. This process repeats for each test case provided by the input.
