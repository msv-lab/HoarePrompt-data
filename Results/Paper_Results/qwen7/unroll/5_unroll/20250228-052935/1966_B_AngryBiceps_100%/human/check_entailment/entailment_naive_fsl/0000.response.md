Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last rows and columns to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not consider other configurations of the grid where all squares could still be made the same color without matching the first and last rows/columns.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
B W B
W B W
B W B
```

In this grid, all squares can be made the same color (either all 'B' or all 'W') through appropriate operations, but the program would incorrectly output 'NO' because the first and last rows/columns do not match.

To correctly solve this problem, one needs to check if all rows or all columns are uniform (i.e., all 'W' or all 'B'). If either all rows or all columns are uniform, then it is possible to make all squares the same color. Otherwise, it is not possible.
