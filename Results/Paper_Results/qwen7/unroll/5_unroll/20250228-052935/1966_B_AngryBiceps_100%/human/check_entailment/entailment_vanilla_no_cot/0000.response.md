Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. Here's why the current implementation is flawed:

1. **Checking Rows and Columns**: The code checks if the first and last rows and columns are uniform but does not consider the entire grid. This approach fails to account for grids where the uniformity of colors is achieved through multiple operations across different subrectangles.

2. **Uniformity Check**: The logic `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1])` and `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row)` only checks the first and last rows/columns and does not guarantee that the whole grid can be made uniform.

3. **Complexity and Constraints**: Given the constraints (up to \(3 \times 10^5\) cells), the solution should handle more complex scenarios where uniformity can be achieved through multiple operations.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, one needs to check if the grid can be made uniform by verifying if there exists at least one row or column that can be used as a reference to make the entire grid uniform. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        if len(set(a)) == 1:
            print("YES")
            continue
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        transposed = list(zip(*a))
        if len(set(transposed)) == 1:
            print("YES")
            continue
        
        # If neither rows nor columns are uniform, check if it's possible to make the grid uniform
        print("NO")

func()
```

This revised function:
1. Transposes the grid to check columns.
2. Checks if all rows or columns are uniform.
3. Prints "YES" if any row or column is uniform, indicating it's possible to make the entire grid uniform.
4. Prints "NO" otherwise.
