Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 3
```

The program will output `4` because it counts all combinations of sticks, but it does not check if the selected sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. However, the only valid combination is choosing the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd stick (lengths 4, 4, and 8), which does not satisfy the triangle inequality (4 + 4 is not greater than 8). Therefore, the correct output should be `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check for the triangle inequality theorem before counting the combinations.
