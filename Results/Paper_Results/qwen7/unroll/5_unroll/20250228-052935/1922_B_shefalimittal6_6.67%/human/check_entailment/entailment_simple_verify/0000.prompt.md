You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    7
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    4
    
    3 2 1 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3
    
    1
    
    1

Output

    35
    2
    0
    0
    
Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will be a series of integers representing the value of `res` after each iteration of the loop, printed for each input integer `t`. Each `res` is calculated based on the frequency of numbers in the input list `nums`, using combinations to count the number of ways to select specific counts of numbers.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks to form a non-degenerate triangle. The logic in the program does not account for the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 2 2 3
```

The program will output `4` because it counts all combinations of sticks, but it does not check if the selected sticks satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. However, the only valid combination is choosing the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd stick (lengths 4, 4, and 8), which does not satisfy the triangle inequality (4 + 4 is not greater than 8). Therefore, the correct output should be `0`.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check for the triangle inequality theorem before counting the combinations.
