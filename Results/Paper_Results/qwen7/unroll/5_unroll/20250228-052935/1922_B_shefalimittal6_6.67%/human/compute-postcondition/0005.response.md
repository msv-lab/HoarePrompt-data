Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads a positive integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), followed by a positive integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) non-negative integers. It then calculates and prints the number of ways to select specific counts of numbers from the list, using combinations. The final output consists of a series of integers, each representing the result for each test case.**
