### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the logic and steps involved in the program. However, let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure it fully meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the occurrences of each stick length, which is correct.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using combinations (`math.comb(cnt, 3)`).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`), where `total_sum` is the sum of counts of all other lengths.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from both calculations are summed up and printed for each test case.

### Detailed Check

#### Case 1: All Sticks Have the Same Length
- If all sticks have the same length, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using combinations. For example, if there are 7 sticks all of length 1, the number of ways to choose 3 out of 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

#### Case 2: Multiple Different Lengths
- For different lengths, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length. For example, if there are 3 sticks of length 3 and 1 stick of length 1, the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of length 3 and 1 stick of length 1 is \( \binom{3}{2} \times 1 = 3 \).

#### Case 3: Edge Cases
- The program handles the edge case where there are fewer than 2 sticks of the same length correctly by not including those in the calculation. For example, if there is only 1 stick of a particular length, the program will not include this in the calculation.

### Example Analysis

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `35`
   - Explanation: Any combination of 3 sticks out of 7 can form a triangle since they all have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 out of 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4 3 2 1 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 1 2 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle because the lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick is given, so no combination of 3 sticks is possible.

### Conclusion

After re-evaluating the program, we confirm that it correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using exactly 3 sticks. It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
