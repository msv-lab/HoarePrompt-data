### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and their corresponding lengths stored in `a_i`.

2. **Counting Occurrences**:
   - The program uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count how many times each length appears.
   - This is done by iterating through the list of stick lengths and updating the counts.

3. **Calculating Combinations**:
   - The program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`, where `total_sum` is the sum of counts of all other lengths.

4. **Combining Results**:
   - The results from both calculations are summed up and printed for each test case.

### Detailed Check

#### Case 1: All Sticks Have the Same Length
- If all sticks have the same length, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length using combinations. For example, if there are 7 sticks all of length 1, the number of ways to choose 3 out of 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

#### Case 2: Multiple Different Lengths
- For different lengths, the program correctly calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length. For example, if the lengths are `[3, 2, 1, 3]`, the valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

#### Case 3: Edge Cases
- The program handles the edge case where there are fewer than 2 sticks of the same length correctly by not including those in the calculation.

### Example Analysis

1. **Test Case 1**:
   - Input: `7 1 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - Output: `35`
   - Explanation: Any combination of 3 sticks out of 7 can form a triangle since they all have the same length. The number of ways to choose 3 out of 7 is \( \binom{7}{3} = 35 \).

2. **Test Case 2**:
   - Input: `4 3 2 1 3`
   - Output: `2`
   - Explanation: The valid combinations are (3, 2, 3) and (3, 1, 3).

3. **Test Case 3**:
   - Input: `3 1 2 3`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: No combination of 3 sticks can form a triangle because the lengths do not satisfy the triangle inequality.

4. **Test Case 4**:
   - Input: `1 1`
   - Output: `0`
   - Explanation: Only one stick is given, so no combination of 3 sticks is possible.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle using exactly 3 sticks. It handles all edge cases and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
