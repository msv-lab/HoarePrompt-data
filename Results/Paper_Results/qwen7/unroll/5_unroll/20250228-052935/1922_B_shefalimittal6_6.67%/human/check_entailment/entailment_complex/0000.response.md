Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks (`n`) and their corresponding lengths (`a_i`).

2. **Frequency Counting**: The program uses a dictionary (`num_of_lens`) to count the frequency of each unique length in the list of stick lengths. This ensures that we can easily compute the number of ways to choose sticks based on their lengths.

3. **Combination Calculations**:
   - For each unique length, if there are at least 3 sticks of that length, the program correctly adds the number of ways to choose 3 sticks from those of the same length using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - If there are at least 2 sticks of a certain length, the program calculates the total number of sticks of other lengths (`total_sum`). It then adds the number of ways to choose 2 sticks from those of the same length and pairs them with any of the remaining sticks using `math.comb(cnt, 2) * total_sum`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs the result for each test case, which is the total number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle.

Given that the logic follows the problem statement accurately and handles all edge cases (such as ensuring that the sum of all `n` does not exceed the limit), the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
