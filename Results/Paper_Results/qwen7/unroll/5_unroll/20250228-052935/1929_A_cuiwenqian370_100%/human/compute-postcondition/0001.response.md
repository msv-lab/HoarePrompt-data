Output State: **`t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string received from standard input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a single line of input from the standard input (which was switched to `sys.stdin.read`), splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was defined in the initial state and represents the number of test cases.
