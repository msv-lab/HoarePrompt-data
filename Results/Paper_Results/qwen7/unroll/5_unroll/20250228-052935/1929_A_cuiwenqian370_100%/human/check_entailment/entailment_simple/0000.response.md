Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements after sorting the array. Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements. This is the correct approach to maximize the beauty of the array.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. It correctly handles the input and output format as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in `func_1` is correct because sorting the array and calculating the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements indeed maximizes the beauty of the array.
   - The logic in `func_2` is correct because it correctly processes multiple test cases, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results in the required format.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
