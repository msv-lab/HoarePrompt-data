### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic behind the program. Let's break down the reasoning to ensure the correctness of the program:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, thereby maximizing the positive differences.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by iterating through the sorted array and computing the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct because sorting the array ensures that the differences are maximized.

3. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The logic for reading and processing input is correct.

4. **Verification with Examples**:
   - The examples provided in the original assessment demonstrate the correct behavior of the program. The program correctly calculates the beauty for each test case by sorting the array and summing the absolute differences.

### Detailed Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples in more detail:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  3
  2 1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  69 69 69
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Execution:
  - The array is already sorted.
  - Beauty = \( (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  57
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
  - Beauty = \( (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \).

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - Beauty = \( (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).

#### Example 5:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) = 1 \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution by sorting the array and calculating the beauty using the sorted array. It also correctly handles multiple test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation
