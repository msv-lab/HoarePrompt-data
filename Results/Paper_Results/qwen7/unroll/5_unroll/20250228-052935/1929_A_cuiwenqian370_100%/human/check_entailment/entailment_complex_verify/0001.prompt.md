You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
    return beauty

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(array)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers where the length of the list is n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
def func_1(array):
    array.sort()
    beauty = 0
    for i in range(1, len(array)):
        beauty += abs(array[i] - array[i - 1])
        
    #State: Output State: `array` is a sorted list of integers with length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and each element a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9); `beauty` is the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the array.
    return beauty
    #The program returns the sum of absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list 'array'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns the sum of the absolute differences between each pair of consecutive elements in the sorted version of the list. The input list must have a length between 2 and 100, and each element must be between 1 and 10^9. After sorting the list, the function calculates and returns the desired sum.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and array is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    index = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        array = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(array)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is an integer equal to `len(data)`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of calling `func_1` on an array of integers.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is an integer equal to `len(data)`, `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each element being the result of calling `func_1` on an array of integers, no new print statements have been added to the `results` list; the original content remains unchanged.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers from standard input, then calls another function `func_1` with this list to compute a result. It stores these results in a list and prints them out. After processing all test cases, the function ends without returning any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - The beauty is calculated as \( \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \).
   - To maximize this, we should arrange the elements such that the positive differences outweigh the negative ones.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The maximum beauty can be achieved by sorting the array and then calculating the beauty using the sorted array. This is because sorting ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty.
   - It iterates through the sorted array and computes the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - This approach is correct for finding the maximum beauty.

4. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.
   - The logic for reading and processing input is correct.

### Verification

Given the above analysis, let's verify the correctness of the program with the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  3
  2 1 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

#### Example 2:
- Input:
  ```
  3
  69 69 69
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  0
  ```

- Execution:
  - The array is already sorted.
  - Beauty = \( (69 - 69) + (69 - 69) = 0 + 0 = 0 \).

#### Example 3:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  5
  100 54 80 43 90
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  57
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
  - Beauty = \( (54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57 \).

#### Example 4:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4
  3 4 3 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 4]`.
  - Beauty = \( (3 - 3) + (3 - 3) + (4 - 3) = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 \).

#### Example 5:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  2
  2 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Execution:
  - After sorting, the array becomes `[1, 2]`.
  - Beauty = \( (2 - 1) = 1 \).

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the solution by sorting the array and calculating the beauty using the sorted array. It also correctly handles multiple test cases.
