Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
3. It initializes `s` to 0 and `m` to 1.
4. The while loop iterates as long as `n` is greater than 0. In each iteration:
   - It calculates `x` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which represents the count of odd multiples of the current multiplier `m`.
   - It halves `n`, effectively moving to the next multiplier.
   - If `k` falls within the range `[s, s + x]`, it breaks out of the loop.
   - Otherwise, it updates `s` by adding `x` and doubles `m`.
5. After exiting the loop, it prints the result `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m`, which correctly computes the `k`-th card based on the described process.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the code, the program appears to correctly implement the described algorithm for determining the `k`-th card laid down by Vladislav.

Correctness: **True**
