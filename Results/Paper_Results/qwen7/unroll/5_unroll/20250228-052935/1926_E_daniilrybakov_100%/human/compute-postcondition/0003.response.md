Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each `i` from 1 to `t`, the following has occurred:
- Two integers `n` and `k` were read from input.
- A variable `s` was initialized to 0.
- A variable `m` was initialized to 1.
- A while loop was executed where `x` was set to `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` was halved, and if `s < k` and `k <= s + x`, the loop was exited; otherwise, `s` was incremented by `x` and `m` was doubled.
- The result `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` was printed.
