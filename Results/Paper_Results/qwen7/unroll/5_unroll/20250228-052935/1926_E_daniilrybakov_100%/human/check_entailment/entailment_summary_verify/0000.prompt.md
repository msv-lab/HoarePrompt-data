You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Vladislav has n cards numbered 1, 2, \dots, n . He wants to lay them down in a
row as follows:

  * First, he lays down all the odd-numbered cards from smallest to largest. 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are twice an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 2 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 3 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 3 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * Next, he lays down all cards that are 4 times an odd number from smallest to largest (i.e. 4 multiplied by an odd number). 
  * And so on, until all cards are laid down. 

What is the k -th card he lays down in this process? Once Vladislav puts a
card down, he cannot use that card again.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5 \cdot 10^4 ) — the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n
\leq 10^9 ) — the number of cards Vlad has, and the position of the card you
need to output.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the k -th card Vladislav lays
down.

Note

In the first seven test cases, n=7 . Vladislav lays down the cards as follows:

  * First — all the odd-numbered cards in the order 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 . 
  * Next — all cards that are twice an odd number in the order 2 , 6 . 
  * Next, there are no remaining cards that are 3 times an odd number. (Vladislav has only one of each card.) 
  * Next — all cards that are 4 times an odd number, and there is only one such card: 4 . 
  * There are no more cards left, so Vladislav stops. 

Thus the order of cards is 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 2 , 6 , 4 .

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the given \( n \) and \( k \) within certain constraints. Specifically, it computes \((2 \times (k - s) - 1) \times m\), where \( s \) and \( m \) are derived through a series of operations involving \( n \) and \( k \).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described process for laying out the cards. Specifically, the logic for determining the k-th card laid down is flawed. Let's consider a detailed example to illustrate the issue.

### Example Analysis
Given the input `n = 7` and `k = 5`, the expected sequence of cards laid down according to the problem description is:
1. First, lay down all odd-numbered cards: 1, 3, 5, 7.
2. Next, lay down all cards that are twice an odd number: 2, 6.
3. Next, there are no cards that are three times an odd number.
4. Finally, lay down the remaining card that is four times an odd number: 4.

So, the sequence should be: 1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 6, 4.

However, the provided program outputs the 5th card as 2, which is incorrect. The program logic incorrectly calculates the position of the k-th card without properly accounting for the sequence of card placements.

### Detailed Explanation
The program attempts to find the correct segment of the sequence using a while loop but fails to accurately map the position `k` to the correct card. The formula `(2 * (k - s) - 1) * m` used to compute the card number is not correct for the given problem constraints.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate through the segments (odd, twice odd, thrice odd, etc.) and keep track of the position within each segment. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = 0
        m = 1
        while n:
            x = (n + 1) // 2
            n //= 2
            if s < k and k <= s + x:
                break
            s += x
            m *= 2
        print((2 * (k - s) - 1) * m)

func()
```

This approach still needs refinement to correctly map `k` to the correct card. A more accurate solution would involve iterating through each segment and keeping track of the current position within that segment.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement the logic, the correctness is **False**.
