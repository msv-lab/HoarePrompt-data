### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Original Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - It splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It initializes the index to 0 and extracts the number of test cases `T`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts `n` (the number of signs).
   - It extracts the list `a` of periodicities.
   - It initializes `last_year` to `a[0]`.
   - It iterates through the list `a` starting from the second element.
   - For each element `a[i]`, it calculates the next year using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
   - This formula is intended to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Calculation Issue:**
   - The issue with the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is that it may not always yield the correct next year. For example, if `last_year` is 7 and `a[i]` is 4, the formula might return 8 instead of 12, skipping some intermediate years.
   - The correct approach should be to use `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]` to ensure the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.

#### Corrected Code:
The original assessment suggests the following corrected code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        last_year = a[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            next_year = (last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]
            last_year = next_year
        results.append(str(last_year))
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
```

#### Evaluation:
- The corrected code uses the formula `(last_year // a[i] + 1) * a[i]` to ensure that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`.
- This approach guarantees that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one, adhering to the problem description.

Given that the corrected code addresses the issue identified in the original assessment and ensures the correct calculation of the next year, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
