Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list containing `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using whitespace as the delimiter.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from standard input (stdin) and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `a` is not yet defined since it is supposed to be populated later based on the number of elements specified by `n`. The variable `data` now holds the split input as a list of strings.
