Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
   - The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly greater than `last_year`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The calculated year for the nth sign is stored in the `results` list.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - Finally, it joins the results and writes them to the standard output.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in chunks for each test case.

2. **Year Calculation:**
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. This is correct because:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start from the year immediately after `last_year`.
     - The division and multiplication ensure that we get the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and processing each one separately.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each result separated by a newline.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to be correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
