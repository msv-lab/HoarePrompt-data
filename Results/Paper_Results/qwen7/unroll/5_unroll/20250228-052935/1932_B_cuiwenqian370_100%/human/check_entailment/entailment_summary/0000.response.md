Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and processes multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the value of `a[0]`.
3. It then iterates through the remaining elements of the list `a`, calculating the next year when the sign will occur based on the current `last_year` and the periodicity `a[i]`.
4. The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and strictly greater than `last_year`.
5. This process continues until all signs have occurred, updating `last_year` at each step.
6. The final `last_year` value is appended to the `results` list for each test case.
7. The program outputs the results correctly, one per line.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
