You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.

    #State: Output State: `index` is 6, `T` is an integer from the data list starting from the position specified by the new `index`, `results` is a list containing the final `last_year` value for each iteration as strings.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of the list `a`), and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it calculates a final value `last_year` based on the initial value of `a[0]` and subsequent values in the list `a`. It then appends the final `last_year` value as a string to the `results` list. After processing all test cases, it writes the final results, each on a new line, to the standard output.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
   - It initializes `last_year` with the value of the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculating the Year for Each Sign:**
   - For each subsequent sign, it calculates the next year when the sign will occur.
   - The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is a multiple of `a[i]` and is strictly greater than `last_year`.

4. **Storing Results:**
   - The calculated year for the nth sign is stored in the `results` list.

5. **Outputting Results:**
   - Finally, it joins the results and writes them to the standard output.

### Detailed Check:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program correctly reads the input and processes it in chunks for each test case.

2. **Year Calculation:**
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is used to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. This is correct because:
     - `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1)` ensures that we start from the year immediately after `last_year`.
     - The division and multiplication ensure that we get the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than `last_year`.

3. **Handling Multiple Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating over them and processing each one separately.

4. **Output Formatting:**
   - The output is formatted correctly, with each result separated by a newline.

### Conclusion:

After reviewing the program, it appears to be correct and follows the logic described in the problem statement accurately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
