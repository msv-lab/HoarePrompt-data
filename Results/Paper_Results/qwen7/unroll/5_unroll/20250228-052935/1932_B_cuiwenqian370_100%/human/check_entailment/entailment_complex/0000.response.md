Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings. This handles multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Test Case Loop**: The program iterates over each test case, correctly extracting the number of signs (`n`) and the list of periodicities (`a`).
3. **Calculation Logic**: For each test case, the program initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`. It then iteratively calculates the next occurrence year for each subsequent sign, ensuring that the calculation accounts for the fact that the next sign can only occur after the previous one has occurred.
4. **Output**: The program constructs the result list and writes the final year for each test case to the standard output.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly handles the input, processes each test case according to the rules provided, and outputs the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
