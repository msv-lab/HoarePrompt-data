### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The function `func_1()` reads the input from standard input and processes it correctly.
   - It initializes `input` to `sys.stdin.read` and splits the input into a list of strings.
   - It iterates over each test case, reading the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year when the next sign will occur.
   - The calculation `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

3. **Output Handling:**
   - After processing each test case, it appends the final `last_year` to the `results` list.
   - Finally, it writes the results to standard output, joining them with newlines.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic handles the edge cases where the first sign occurs in the current year and ensures that the next sign only occurs strictly after the previous one.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially.

### Correctness:
**True**
