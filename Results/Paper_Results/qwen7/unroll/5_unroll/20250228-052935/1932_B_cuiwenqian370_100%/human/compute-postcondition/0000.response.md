Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the list `a` contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, and the function `input = sys.stdin.read` has been assigned to read input from stdin.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` assigns the function `sys.stdin.read` to the variable `input`. This function reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. However, no variables are updated or modified with specific values; they retain their initial conditions. Therefore, the only change is the assignment of the input reading method.
