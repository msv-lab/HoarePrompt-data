Output State: **`index` is 6, `T` is an integer from the data list starting from the position specified by the new `index`, `results` is a list containing the final `last_year` value for each iteration as strings.**

The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, with each element separated by a newline character. However, this operation does not change the values of the variables `index`, `T`, or `results`. Therefore, these variables retain their previous values as described in the initial state.
