Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from the data list starting from the position specified by `index`, `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The values of `index` and `T` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, `index` is still 2, and `T` is still an integer from the data list starting from the position specified by `index`. The new variable `results` is an empty list.
