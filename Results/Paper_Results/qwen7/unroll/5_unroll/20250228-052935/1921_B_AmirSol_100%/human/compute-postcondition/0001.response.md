Output State: **`cats_to_add` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1' for `i` in the range of `n`; `cats_to_remove` is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' for `i` in the range of `n`; `n` is a positive integer, and `s1` and `s2` are strings of length `n` consisting of '0' and '1'.**

Explanation: The code calculates the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0' and assigns this count to `cats_to_remove`. The value of `cats_to_add` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the number of positions where `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1'. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unaffected.
