Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state of the boxes (represented by `s1`) to the desired state (represented by `s2`). Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the number of boxes (`n`), the initial state (`s1`), and the desired state (`s2`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It calculates the number of cats that need to be added (`cats_to_add`) by iterating through the strings `s1` and `s2`. If `s1[i]` is '0' and `s2[i]` is '1', it means a cat needs to be added to box `i`.
   - Similarly, it calculates the number of cats that need to be removed (`cats_to_remove`) by checking if `s1[i]` is '1' and `s2[i]` is '0'.
   - The function returns the maximum of these two values, which represents the minimum number of operations needed. This is because moving a cat from one box to another can be considered either adding a cat to an empty box or removing a cat from a non-empty box, depending on the direction of the move.

3. **Output**: For each test case, the program prints the result returned by `func_1`.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly computes the minimum number of operations required to achieve the desired state from the initial state. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
