Output State: **`len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character from `unique_chars` maps to the character at the opposite end of the sequence; `decoded` is a string created by joining the mapped characters from `encoded`.**

Explanation: The code snippet `decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)` creates a new string `decoded` by mapping each character in `encoded` to its corresponding value in `char_map`. The lengths and mappings of `unique_chars` and `char_map` remain unchanged. Therefore, `len_unique` and `char_map` retain their original values, and a new variable `decoded` is introduced with the value derived from the mapping process.
