The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from a reverse-mapped dictionary `char_map`, where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a character at the opposite position in the sorted list of unique characters.
