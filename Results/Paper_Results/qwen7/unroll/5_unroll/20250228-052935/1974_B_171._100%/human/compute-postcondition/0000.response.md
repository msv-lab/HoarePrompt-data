Output State: **`unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from the string `encoded`.**

Explanation: The code `unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))` creates a set from the string `encoded` to remove duplicate characters, and then sorts these unique characters. Since `encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `unique_chars` will be a list of these unique characters in sorted order. The length of `encoded` (denoted as `n`) remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.
