Output State: **`unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from the string `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. The value of `unique_chars` remains unchanged as no operations were performed on it. Therefore, `unique_chars` is still a list of the sorted unique characters from the string `encoded`, and `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
