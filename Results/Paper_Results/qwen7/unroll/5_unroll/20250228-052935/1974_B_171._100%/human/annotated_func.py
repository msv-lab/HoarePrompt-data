#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The string encoded is the result of encoding some original string s according to the specified algorithm.
def func_1(encoded):
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    char_map = {}
    len_unique = len(unique_chars)
    for i in range(len_unique):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
        
    #State: Output State: `len_unique` is the length of `unique_chars`; `char_map` is a dictionary where each character from `unique_chars` maps to the character at the opposite end of the sequence.
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns the string `decoded`, which is created by joining the mapped characters from `encoded` using the dictionary `char_map`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a new string `decoded`. The `decoded` string is formed by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from a reverse-mapped dictionary `char_map`, where each unique character in `encoded` is mapped to a character at the opposite position in the sorted list of unique characters.
