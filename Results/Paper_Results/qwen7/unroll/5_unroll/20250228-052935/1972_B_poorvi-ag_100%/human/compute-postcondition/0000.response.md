Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `n` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", and the initial value of `t` is unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The initial value of `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, and the variable `n` remains as a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D". The initial state of `t` is preserved, and the variable `n` is not affected by this line of code.
