You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n sticks of lengths a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the maximum
number of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can construct simultaneously,
such that:

  * Each side of a polygon is formed by exactly one stick. 
  * No stick is used in more than 1 polygon. 

Note: Sticks cannot be broken.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of sticks available.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 100 ) — the stick lengths.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the maximum number
of regular (equal-sided) polygons you can make simultaneously from the sticks
available.

Example

Input

    1
    
    1
    
    2
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    2 2 3 3 3 3
    
    9
    
    4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4

Output

    0
    0
    1
    2
    
Note

In the first test case, we only have one stick, hence we can't form any
polygon.

In the second test case, the two sticks aren't enough to form a polygon
either.

In the third test case, we can use the 4 sticks of length 3 to create a
square.

In the fourth test case, we can make a pentagon with side length 2 , and a
square of side length 4 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
    return sum((v // 3 for v in freq.values()))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(arr))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers where the first element is the number of sticks available (n), and the subsequent elements are the lengths of the sticks (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). Each stick length is a positive integer not exceeding 100, and the number of sticks (n) is a positive integer not exceeding 100.
def func_1(arr):
    freq = {}
    for n in arr:
        freq[n] = freq.get(n, 0) + 1
        
    #State: Output State: `arr` is a list of integers where the first element is the number of unique stick lengths encountered (n), and the subsequent elements are the unique stick lengths (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) in any order; `freq` is a dictionary where each key is a stick length from `arr` and its value is the count of how many times that length appears in the original list.
    return sum(v // 3 for v in freq.values())
    #The program returns the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3, where the frequency is the count of how many times each stick length appears in the original list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `arr` where the first element indicates the number of sticks, and the rest of the elements represent the lengths of those sticks. It then counts the frequency of each unique stick length, divides each count by 3 using integer division, and returns the sum of these results.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed from the given sticks.
2. A regular polygon with `k` sides requires `k` sticks of the same length.
3. To maximize the number of polygons, we need to find the minimum frequency of any stick length because this will limit how many complete polygons we can form.
4. The given program attempts to solve this by counting the frequency of each stick length using a dictionary (`freq`) and then calculating the total number of polygons by dividing the frequency of each length by 3 (since a triangle is the smallest polygon).
5. However, the logic in `func_1` is flawed:
   - It correctly counts the frequency of each stick length.
   - But it incorrectly assumes that the number of polygons is the sum of the integer division of each frequency by 3.
   - This approach does not account for the fact that we need to use the minimum frequency of any stick length to determine the maximum number of complete polygons.
6. For example, if the input is `[2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3]`, the function would return `1 + 1 = 2`, which is incorrect. We can actually form one square (4 sides of length 2) and one triangle (3 sides of length 3).

Given these points, the provided solution is incorrect.
