Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop head only involves the variable `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the Initial State**: The initial state given is that `t` is an input integer. We need to adjust this state to ensure the loop condition is met.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
