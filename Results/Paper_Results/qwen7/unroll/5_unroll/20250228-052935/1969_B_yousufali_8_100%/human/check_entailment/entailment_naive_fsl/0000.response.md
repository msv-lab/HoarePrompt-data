Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Specifically, consider the input `101011`. According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would involve multiple cyclic shifts to sort the string, but the current implementation does not account for this. Instead, it counts the number of zeros followed by ones, which does not reflect the actual cost of cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.

For example, for the input `101011`, the optimal solution involves the following steps:
1. Choose the substring `[3, 5]` and perform a cyclic shift: `101011 -> 110101`.
2. Choose the substring `[1, 2]` and perform a cyclic shift: `110101 -> 011011`.

The total cost is `4 + 2 = 6`, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `11` because it simply counts the number of zeros followed by ones without considering the actual cost of cyclic shifts.
