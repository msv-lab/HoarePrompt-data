Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `s` is a binary string.
   - `n` is 0.
   - `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for every occurrence of '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

To determine what will be printed, we need to understand how `ans` is calculated. According to the initial state, `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for every occurrence of '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1'. 

Let's consider the formula for `ans`:
- For each '0' in `s` that follows at least one '1', we add `n + 1` to `ans`.
- Since `n` is initially 0, each such '0' contributes `0 + 1 = 1` to `ans`.

Therefore, `ans` is simply the count of '0's in `s` that follow at least one '1'.

Without the specific value of `s`, we cannot give a numerical answer. However, we can describe the value of `ans` in terms of the binary string `s`.

Output: **ans (where ans is the count of '0's in s that follow at least one '1')**
