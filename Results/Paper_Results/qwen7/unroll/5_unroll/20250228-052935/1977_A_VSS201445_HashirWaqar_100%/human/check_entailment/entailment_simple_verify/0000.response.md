### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - We need to determine if it is possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - Valid inputs: `1 ≤ t ≤ 100` (number of test cases), `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100`.

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   ```python
   def func():
       for _ in range(int(input())):
           (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
           
           if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
               print('YES')
           else:
               print('NO')
   ```

3. **Annotations:**
   - The program iterates over the number of test cases specified by the user.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.
   - It checks if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `(n - m)` is even.
   - If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

4. **Correctness Evaluation:**
   - The logic `if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0` is correct.
     - `n >= m` ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach `m` cubes.
     - `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of additions and removals is even, which is necessary to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n < m`, it is impossible to end up with `m` cubes because we cannot add more cubes than we start with.
   - If `(n - m) % 2 != 0`, it means the difference between the number of additions and removals is odd, which also makes it impossible to end up with exactly `m` cubes.

6. **Example Test Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `n = 3`, `m = 3`
     - `3 >= 3` is True, and `(3 - 3) % 2 == 0` is True.
     - Output: `YES`
   - **Case 2:** `n = 2`, `m = 4`
     - `2 >= 4` is False.
     - Output: `NO`
   - **Case 3:** `n = 5`, `m = 3`
     - `5 >= 3` is True, and `(5 - 3) % 2 == 0` is True.
     - Output: `YES`

The program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
