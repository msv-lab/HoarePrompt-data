Output State: **`n` is decreased by 1 for each iteration of the while loop, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2` for each value of `l`, and `print(s)` outputs the value of `s`.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer `n` which indicates the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and prints the value of `s`. After processing each test case, `n` is decremented by 1. The initial values of `t`, `x_i`, `y_i` are not affected by the code, and the loop continues until `n` becomes 0.
