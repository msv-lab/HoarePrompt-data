Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`ntest`) and for each test case, it reads the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself (`a`).

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in ascending order. Sorting helps in pairing the smallest and largest elements efficiently.

3. **Calculating Beauty**: The program then calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This is done using a loop that iterates over half the length of the sorted array, adding the difference between the corresponding elements from the start and end of the sorted array.

4. **Output**: The calculated beauty is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function is correct. The program correctly follows the steps required to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and then summing the differences between paired elements.

Correctness: **True**
