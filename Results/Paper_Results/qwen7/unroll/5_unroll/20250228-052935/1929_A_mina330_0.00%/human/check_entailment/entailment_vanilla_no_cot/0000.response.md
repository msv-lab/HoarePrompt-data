Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the smallest and largest elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum possible beauty. The correct strategy should involve rearranging the array such that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized.

To achieve the maximum beauty, we should pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) is maximized.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(ntest):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(n // 2):
            kq += a[n - 1 - i] - a[i]
        if n % 2 != 0:
            kq += a[n // 2]
        print(kq)

func()
```

This corrected version correctly pairs the smallest and largest elements to maximize the beauty of the array.
