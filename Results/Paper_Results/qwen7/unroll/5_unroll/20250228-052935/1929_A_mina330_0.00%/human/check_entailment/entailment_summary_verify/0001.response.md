### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - To maximize this sum, we should arrange the elements such that the largest values are paired with the smallest values to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the sorted array, pairing each element with its corresponding element from the second half of the array.
   - For each pair, it calculates the difference and sums these differences to get the final result.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.
   - However, the current implementation only considers the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. This approach does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array because it does not consider the optimal arrangement of all elements.

4. **Counterexample:**
   - Consider the array `[10, 20, 30, 40]`.
     - If we sort and pair as in the current implementation: `[10, 20, 30, 40] -> (20-10) + (40-30) = 20 + 10 = 30`.
     - However, if we rearrange the array to `[10, 40, 20, 30]`, the beauty would be: `(40-10) + (30-20) = 30 + 10 = 40`.
   - This counterexample shows that the current implementation does not always produce the maximum beauty.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles arrays of even and odd lengths correctly.
   - For an even-length array, it pairs elements symmetrically around the middle.
   - For an odd-length array, the middle element does not participate in the pairing, but this does not affect the maximization of the beauty since the middle element is neither contributing positively nor negatively to the sum.

6. **Verification:**
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement do not cover all possible scenarios, and the counterexample demonstrates that the current solution is not always correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the beauty of the array. The current approach only considers specific pairs and does not ensure the optimal arrangement of all elements.

**Correctness:** **False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
