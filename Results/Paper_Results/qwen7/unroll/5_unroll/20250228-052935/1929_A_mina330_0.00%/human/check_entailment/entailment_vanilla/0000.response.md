### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - To maximize this sum, we should arrange the elements such that the largest values are paired with the smallest values to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the sorted array, pairing each element with its corresponding element from the second half of the array.
   - For each pair, it calculates the difference and sums these differences to get the final result.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.
   - The loop correctly pairs the smallest elements with the largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles arrays of even and odd lengths correctly.
   - For an even-length array, it pairs elements symmetrically around the middle.
   - For an odd-length array, the middle element does not participate in the pairing, but this does not affect the maximization of the beauty since the middle element is neither contributing positively nor negatively to the sum.

5. **Verification:**
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement confirm the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and pairing elements appropriately.

**Correctness:** **True**
