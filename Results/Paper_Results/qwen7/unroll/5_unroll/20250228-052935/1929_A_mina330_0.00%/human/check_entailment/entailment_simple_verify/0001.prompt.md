You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        kq = 0
        
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        
        print(kq)
        
    #State: Output State: The sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on, for each test case provided by the input. This process is repeated for each of the ntest test cases.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements: \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - To maximize this sum, we should arrange the elements such that the largest values are paired with the smallest values to maximize the positive differences and minimize the negative ones.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
   - It then iterates through the first half of the sorted array, pairing each element with its corresponding element from the second half of the array.
   - For each pair, it calculates the difference and sums these differences to get the final result.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - Sorting the array ensures that the smallest elements are paired with the largest elements, maximizing the positive differences.
   - The loop correctly pairs the smallest elements with the largest elements, ensuring the maximum possible beauty.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles arrays of even and odd lengths correctly.
   - For an even-length array, it pairs elements symmetrically around the middle.
   - For an odd-length array, the middle element does not participate in the pairing, but this does not affect the maximization of the beauty since the middle element is neither contributing positively nor negatively to the sum.

5. **Verification:**
   - The example cases provided in the problem statement confirm the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting and pairing elements appropriately.

**Correctness:** **True**
