Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in s:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `s`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The variable `i` takes on the value of each character in `s` during each iteration.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: Since the loop starts iterating from the first character of `s`, the initial value of `i` should be the first character of `s`.

4. **Determine the initial state of `s`**: The string `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000. The loop will execute as long as `s` is not an empty string.

5. **Adjust the states**: Based on the above points, we need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty binary string and `i` is set to the first character of `s`.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`**
