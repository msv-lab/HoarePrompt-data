Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The provided solution attempts to solve the problem by calculating the sum of (number of '1's before each '0') + 1 for every '0' in the string.
3. Let's analyze the logic:
   - For each '0' in the string, the algorithm counts the number of '1's that appear before it and adds this count plus one to the total cost.
   - This approach is based on the observation that moving all '1's before a '0' to the end of the string (by performing cyclic shifts) will result in the minimum cost.
4. To verify the correctness:
   - Consider the example "10". The algorithm correctly identifies that there is one '1' before the '0', so the cost is 1 + 1 = 2.
   - For "0000", no operations are needed, so the cost is 0.
   - For "11000", the algorithm correctly calculates the cost as 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.
   - For "101011", the algorithm correctly calculates the cost as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9.
   - For "01101001", the algorithm correctly calculates the cost as 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11.

Given the examples and the logic of the algorithm, it appears that the provided solution correctly calculates the minimum total cost to sort the binary string.

Correctness: **True**
