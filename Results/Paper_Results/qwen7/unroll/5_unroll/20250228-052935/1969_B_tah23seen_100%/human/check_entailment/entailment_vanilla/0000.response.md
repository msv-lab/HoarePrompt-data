Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to calculate the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s`.
3. **Cost Calculation Logic**:
   - The variable `cost` is initialized to 0.
   - The variable `one` is used to count the number of consecutive '1's encountered.
   - For each character in the string `s`, if the character is '1', `one` is incremented.
   - If the character is '0' and there have been at least one '1' before (i.e., `one > 0`), the cost is updated by adding `one + 1`. This logic is based on the observation that each '0' requires a separate operation to move past all preceding '1's.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1(s)` for each test case and decrements `t` until all test cases are processed.

Given the problem description and the provided example, the logic in `func_1(s)` appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string by considering the positions of '0's relative to '1's.

Correctness: **True**
