Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is an integer within the range [1, 10^4], and `k` is an integer within the range [1, 10^9]. The function returns a list `nums` where `nums[0]` is set to `k`, and for each index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `nums[i]` is the minimum value between `nums[0] + 1` and `k`. After setting each value in the list, `k` is decremented by the value of `nums[i]`.**
