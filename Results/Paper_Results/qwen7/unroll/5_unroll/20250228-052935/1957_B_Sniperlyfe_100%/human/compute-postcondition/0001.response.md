Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of n zeros; `nums[0]` is (1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)) - 1.**

Explanation: The code sets `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. Here, `k.bit_length()` returns the number of bits necessary to represent `k` in binary form. For example, if `k` is 5, `k.bit_length()` would be 3 because 5 in binary is 101, which requires 3 bits. So, `1 << (k.bit_length() - 1)` shifts 1 left by `k.bit_length() - 1` positions, resulting in `2^(k.bit_length() - 1)`. Subtracting 1 from this gives us `2^(k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is assigned to `nums[0]`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
