Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved in this loop head is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is a positive integer.
   - Given the initial state, `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop depends on the input value, and `t` is already defined as a positive integer within the specified range, we need to ensure that the input matches this condition.
   - Therefore, the input should be a positive integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

### Final State Adjustment:

The only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the input value, which should be a positive integer within the specified range.

### Final Answer:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and the input must be a positive integer within the same range**.
