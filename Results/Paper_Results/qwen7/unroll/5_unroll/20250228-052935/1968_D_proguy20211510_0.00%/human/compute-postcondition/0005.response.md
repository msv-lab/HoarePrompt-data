Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, the output will be either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The exact output for each test case depends on the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, permutation `p`, and array `a`. The loop processes each test case independently, so the output for one test case does not affect the others.
