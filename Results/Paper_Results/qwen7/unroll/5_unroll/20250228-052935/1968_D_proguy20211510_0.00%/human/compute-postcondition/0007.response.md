Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers n, k, P_B, P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. It determines the winner (Bodya, Sasha, or Draw) based on specific conditions related to the maximum values in the array a and their positions in the permutation p. The function outputs the result for each test case independently, without affecting the results of other test cases.**
