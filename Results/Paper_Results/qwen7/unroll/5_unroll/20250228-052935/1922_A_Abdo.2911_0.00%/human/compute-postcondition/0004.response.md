Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c, each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters. For each test case, the function determines and returns a specific output based on the given inputs.**

Note: The actual logic to determine the return value is not described here as per the instructions.
