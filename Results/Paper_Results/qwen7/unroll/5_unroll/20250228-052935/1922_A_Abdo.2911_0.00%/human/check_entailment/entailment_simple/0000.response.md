Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. It initializes the template list by comparing characters of `a` and `b`. If the characters at the same position are the same, it appends the character from `a` to the template. If they are different, it appends the uppercase version of the character from `a`.
3. After constructing the template, it checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
   - For lowercase characters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `a` or `b` matches.
   - For uppercase characters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match the lowercase version of the template character.
4. It then checks if `c` does not match the template:
   - For lowercase characters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` does not match.
   - For uppercase characters in the template, it ensures that the corresponding character in `c` matches the lowercase version of the template character.
5. Based on these checks, it prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the logic and the checks performed, the program appears to correctly implement the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
