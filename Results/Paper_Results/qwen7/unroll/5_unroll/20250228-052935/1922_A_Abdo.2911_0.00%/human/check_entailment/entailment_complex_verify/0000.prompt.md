You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), n, a, b, and c are strings of equal length n, where each character in a, b, and c is either a lowercase or uppercase letter. For each iteration of the loop, if the conditions specified in the code are met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The final output state is determined by the cumulative output of all iterations, with 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each containing an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of strings), and three strings a, b, and c (each of length n). For each test case, it constructs a template string based on the comparison of characters in a and b. It then checks if the template matches a and b but does not match c. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. Specifically, the program fails to ensure that the string `c` does not match the template under the specified conditions. Let's consider the following example:

### Test Case:
```
n = 3
a = "acc"
b = "abd"
c = "abc"
```

### Expected Behavior:
- The program should check if there exists a template such that both `a` and `b` match the template, but `c` does not.
- In this case, we can construct a template `"ACc"` where:
  - `a` ("acc") matches because the first character is lowercase and matches, and the second and third characters do not conflict.
  - `b` ("abd") does not match because the first character is uppercase and `b[0]` ('a') is not equal to the lowercase version of `t[0]` ('A').
  - `c` ("abc") does not match because the first character is lowercase and `c[0]` ('a') is not equal to the lowercase version of `t[0]` ('A').

However, the program incorrectly prints "NO" for this case. This is because the program checks if `c` matches the template and sets `match_c` to `False` as soon as it finds a mismatch, without properly checking if `a` and `b` also match the template.

### Program Analysis:
- The program constructs a template by comparing `a[i]` and `b[i]`.
- It then checks if `a` and `b` match the constructed template.
- It also checks if `c` matches the template, setting `match_c` to `False` if it does not.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
