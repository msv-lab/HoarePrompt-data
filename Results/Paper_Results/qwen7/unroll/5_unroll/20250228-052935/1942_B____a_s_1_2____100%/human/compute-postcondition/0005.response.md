Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a permutation \( p \) of length \( n \) such that each element \( p[i] \) is equal to \( \text{mex} - a[i] \), where \( \text{mex} \) is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the list \( p \) so far. The function then prints the permutation \( p \) for each test case.**
