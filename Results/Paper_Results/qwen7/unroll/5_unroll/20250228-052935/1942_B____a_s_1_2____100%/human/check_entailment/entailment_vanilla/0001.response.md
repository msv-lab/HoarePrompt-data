Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly constructs a valid permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `p` of size \( n \) with `-1` values.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing Permutation:**
   - The loop runs from \( n-1 \) down to \( 0 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates \( p[i] \) as \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the permutation \( p \).

### Correctness Check:

#### Key Points to Verify:
1. **Correct Calculation of \( p[i] \):**
   - The calculation \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \) should ensure that \( p[i] \) is the smallest integer not present in \( p[0:i+1] \) minus \( a[i] \).
   - However, this approach might not always yield the correct \( p \) because:
     - The value of `mex` is updated after calculating \( p[i] \), which can lead to incorrect values if the initial `mex` is not correctly maintained.
     - The logic assumes that the current `mex` value is always correct, but this might not hold true if the previous values of \( p \) are not correctly handled.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the calculated \( p[i] \) might be out of bounds (i.e., negative or greater than \( n-1 \)).
   - It also does not ensure that all values in \( p \) are unique and within the range \( [0, n-1] \).

3. **Guaranteed Validity:**
   - The problem statement guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, but the given implementation does not necessarily guarantee that the constructed permutation is valid for all cases.

### Example Verification:

Given the example in the problem statement:
- Test case 1: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
- Expected output: \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)

Let's verify the steps:
- For \( i = 4 \): \( p[4] = \text{mex} - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \), \(\text{mex} = 3\)
- For \( i = 3 \): \( p[3] = \text{mex} - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \(\text{mex} = 2\)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( p[2] = \text{mex} - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \), \(\text{mex} = 4\)
- For \( i = 1 \): \( p[1] = \text{mex} - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3 \), \(\text{mex} = 3\)
- For \( i = 0 \): \( p[0] = \text{mex} - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \(\text{mex} = 2\)

This results in \( p = [2, 3, 4, 2, 3] \), which is not a valid permutation since it contains duplicate values.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly construct a valid permutation \( p \) based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
