Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) of the permutation and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `p` of size \( n \) with `-1` values.
   - It also initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing Permutation:**
   - The loop runs in reverse order from \( n-1 \) to \( 0 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates \( p[i] \) as \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - After constructing the permutation, it prints the values of `p`.

### Reasoning:

1. **Reverse Order Calculation:**
   - The loop starts from the end of the array and works backwards. This is crucial because the MEX calculation depends on the future elements of the permutation.
   
2. **Updating MEX:**
   - The `mex` variable is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated \( p[i] \). This ensures that `mex` always reflects the smallest unused value in the context of the current state of the permutation.

3. **Correctness of Calculation:**
   - For each \( i \), \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \) ensures that the MEX condition is satisfied. Since `mex` is the smallest unused value, subtracting \( a[i] \) from `mex` gives a valid candidate for \( p[i] \).
   - The reverse order ensures that the MEX calculation is done considering the future elements, which is necessary for the MEX definition.

### Example Verification:

Given the example in the problem statement:
- For the input:
  ```
  5
  1 1 -2 1 2
  ```

- The program constructs the permutation as follows:
  - Initialize `p` as \([-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]\)
  - Start from the last element:
    - \( p[4] = \text{mex} - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \)
    - Update `mex` to 3
  - Continue:
    - \( p[3] = \text{mex} - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
    - Update `mex` to 2
    - \( p[2] = \text{mex} - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \)
    - Update `mex` to 4
    - \( p[1] = \text{mex} - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3 \)
    - Update `mex` to 3
    - \( p[0] = \text{mex} - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2 \)
    - Update `mex` to 2

- The resulting permutation \( p \) is \([2, 3, 4, 2, 3]\), which satisfies the conditions.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly constructs the permutation \( p \) based on the array \( a \) using the reverse order approach and updating the MEX value appropriately.

**Correctness: True**
