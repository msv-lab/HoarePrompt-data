### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the given program does not correctly construct a valid permutation \( p \) based on the provided problem description. Let's re-evaluate the program and the problem description to confirm this conclusion.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Given an array \( a \) of length \( n \), we need to construct a permutation \( p \) such that \( a_i = \text{MEX}(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_i) - p_i \).
- The \(\text{MEX}\) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array.
- The program should output a valid permutation \( p \) for each test case.

#### Program Recap:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        mex = n
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            mex = min(mex, p[i])
        print(*p)
```

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the length \( n \) and the array \( a \).

2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes an array `p` of size \( n \) with `-1` values.
   - It initializes `mex` (minimum excluded value) to \( n \).

3. **Constructing Permutation:**
   - The loop runs from \( n-1 \) down to \( 0 \).
   - For each index \( i \), it calculates \( p[i] \) as \( \text{mex} - a[i] \).
   - It then updates `mex` to be the minimum of its current value and the newly calculated \( p[i] \).

4. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the permutation \( p \).

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of \( p[i] \):**
   - The calculation \( p[i] = \text{mex} - a[i] \) does not ensure that \( p[i] \) is the smallest integer not present in \( p[0:i+1] \) minus \( a[i] \).
   - The value of `mex` is updated after calculating \( p[i] \), which can lead to incorrect values if the previous values of \( p \) are not correctly handled.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where the calculated \( p[i] \) might be out of bounds (i.e., negative or greater than \( n-1 \)).
   - It also does not ensure that all values in \( p \) are unique and within the range \( [0, n-1] \).

3. **Guaranteed Validity:**
   - The problem statement guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, but the given implementation does not necessarily guarantee that the constructed permutation is valid for all cases.

#### Example Verification:
Given the example in the problem statement:
- Test case 1: \( n = 5 \), \( a = [1, 1, -2, 1, 2] \)
- Expected output: \( p = [0, 1, 4, 2, 3] \)

Let's verify the steps:
- For \( i = 4 \): \( p[4] = \text{mex} - a[4] = 5 - 2 = 3 \), \(\text{mex} = 3\)
- For \( i = 3 \): \( p[3] = \text{mex} - a[3] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \(\text{mex} = 2\)
- For \( i = 2 \): \( p[2] = \text{mex} - a[2] = 2 - (-2) = 4 \), \(\text{mex} = 4\)
- For \( i = 1 \): \( p[1] = \text{mex} - a[1] = 4 - 1 = 3 \), \(\text{mex} = 3\)
- For \( i = 0 \): \( p[0] = \text{mex} - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2 \), \(\text{mex} = 2\)

This results in \( p = [2, 3, 4, 2, 3] \), which is not a valid permutation since it contains duplicate values.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly construct a valid permutation \( p \) based on the provided problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

**Final: False**
