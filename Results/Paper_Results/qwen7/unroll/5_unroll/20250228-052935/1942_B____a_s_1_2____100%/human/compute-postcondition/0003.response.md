Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, and p is a list of n integers where each element p[i] is calculated as mex - a[i] with mex being the minimum value between the current mex and (mex - a[i]) as the loop iterates backwards from n-1 to 0. After all iterations, p contains the final values computed for each input case.
