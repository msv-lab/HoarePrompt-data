### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`.
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` for each test case.
   - `func_3` calculates the sum of certain values based on conditions.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic of the program processes each test case:
     - It initializes variables like `arr`, `k_arr`, and `temp_pop`.
     - It sorts the items based on `b_i` (price for Bob).
     - It pushes the highest `k` items into `k_arr` (priority queue).
     - It iteratively processes the remaining items, adjusting the sum (`sub_sum`) and updating `max_value` if necessary.

3. **Key Points to Verify:**
   - The program correctly handles the sorting and priority queue operations.
   - The logic for updating `sub_sum` and `max_value` seems appropriate for the given problem constraints.
   - The function `func_3` is correctly implemented to handle the summation logic based on the conditions provided.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `k` is 0 or when there are fewer than `k` items.
   - The use of negative values for `a_i` and positive values for `b_i` is handled appropriately.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the maximum profit for each test case, which aligns with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the annotated program and the logic, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
