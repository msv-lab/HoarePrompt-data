Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: This function returns an integer value read from input.
   - `func_2()`: This function returns a tuple of integers read from input.
   - `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`: This function calculates a sum based on the elements of `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads input values for `t`, `n`, and `k`.
   - It then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It calls `func_3(a, b)` to compute the result.

3. **Function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`**:
   - It initializes `sub_summ` to 0.
   - It iterates over `sec_arr` (which is `b` in the context of the problem) and adds each element to `sub_summ`.
   - It then iterates over `main_ar` (which is `a` in the context of the problem) and checks if the sum of corresponding elements in `a` and `b` is non-negative. If true, it adds this sum to `sub_summ`.

### Correctness Check

#### Problem Understanding:
- Alice wants to maximize her profit.
- Bob wants to minimize Alice's profit.
- Alice can buy any subset of items.
- Bob can take up to `k` items for free, and Alice pays for the rest.

#### Function `func_3(main_ar, sec_arr)`:
- The function sums all elements in `b` and some elements in `a` if their sum with corresponding elements in `b` is non-negative.
- This logic does not align with the problem statement. Specifically, it does not account for Bob taking `k` items for free or Alice's optimal strategy.

#### Example Verification:
- Consider the second test case: `n=4`, `k=1`, `a=[1, 2, 1, 4]`, `b=[3, 2, 3, 3]`.
  - Alice should buy the 1st and 2nd items (`a[0] + a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3`).
  - Bob will take the 1st item for free, and Alice will sell the 2nd item to Bob for `b[1] = 2`.
  - Alice's profit is `2 - 1 = 1`.

The given function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
The program is incorrect because the function `func_3` does not correctly implement the logic for calculating Alice's profit based on the given problem description.

**Correctness: **False**
