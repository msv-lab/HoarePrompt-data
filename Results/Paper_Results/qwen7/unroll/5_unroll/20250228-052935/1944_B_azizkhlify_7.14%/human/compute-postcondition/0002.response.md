Output State: The output consists of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case, it prints pairs of numbers from the list `a` based on the following rules:

1. It first prints pairs of numbers from the first half of the list `a` (indices 0 to n-1) where each number appears exactly twice. It stops once it has printed `k` such pairs or when there are no more such pairs left.
2. If there are still required pairs (`k` is not zero), it then prints single occurrences from the first half of the list `a` until it has printed the remaining required pairs.
3. After that, it prints the collected single occurrences from step 2.
4. Finally, it prints pairs of numbers from the second half of the list `a` (indices n to 2n-1) where each number appears exactly twice, stopping when it matches the count of pairs printed in the first step.

Each line ends with a space-separated list of the single occurrences printed during the process, followed by a newline.
