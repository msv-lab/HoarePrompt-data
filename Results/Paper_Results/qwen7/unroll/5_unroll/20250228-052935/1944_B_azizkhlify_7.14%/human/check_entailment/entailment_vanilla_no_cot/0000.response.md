Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect for the given problem:

1. **Incorrect Initialization and Logic**:
   - The variables `l` and `r` are initialized with size `n`, but they should be of size `2k`.
   - The logic for selecting elements to form `l` and `r` is flawed. The code tries to directly print pairs of elements from the original array without ensuring that the XOR condition is met.

2. **XOR Calculation and Subset Selection**:
   - The code attempts to pre-count occurrences of each element in `l` and `r` but does not correctly ensure that the XOR of elements in `l` equals the XOR of elements in `r`.
   - The approach of printing pairs of elements from the original array without considering their XOR values is incorrect.

3. **Subset Selection**:
   - The code does not properly handle the selection of elements to form the subsets `l` and `r` such that their XOR values match.
   - The logic for forming `l` and `r` does not guarantee that the XOR condition will be satisfied.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to:
- Calculate the XOR of all elements in the array.
- Use this XOR value to guide the selection of elements for `l` and `r` such that their XOR values match.
- Ensure that the selected elements form valid subsets `l` and `r` of length `2k`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Calculate the XOR of all elements in the array
        xor_all = 0
        for num in a:
            xor_all ^= num
        
        # Initialize subsets l and r
        l = []
        r = []
        
        # Function to find a subset with a given XOR value
        def find_subset(xor_value, arr, k, subset):
            stack = [(0, 0, 0)]  # (index, current_xor, count)
            while stack:
                index, current_xor, count = stack.pop()
                if count == k:
                    subset.extend([a[i] for i in range(index) if a[i] == current_xor])
                    return True
                for i in range(index, len(arr)):
                    if arr[i] == current_xor:
                        if find_subset(xor_value ^ current_xor, arr[i+1:], k - count, subset):
                            subset.append(current_xor)
                            return True
                        stack.append((i + 1, current_xor, count))
            return False
        
        # Find a subset l with XOR equal to xor_all // 2
        find_subset(xor_all // 2, a[:n], k, l)
        
        # Find a subset r with XOR equal to xor_all // 2
        find_subset(xor_all // 2, a[n:], k, r)
        
        # Output the subsets
        print(' '.join(map(str, l)))
        print(' '.join(map(str, r)))

func()
```

This solution ensures that the XOR of elements in `l` and `r` matches the required condition by using a recursive function to find valid subsets.
