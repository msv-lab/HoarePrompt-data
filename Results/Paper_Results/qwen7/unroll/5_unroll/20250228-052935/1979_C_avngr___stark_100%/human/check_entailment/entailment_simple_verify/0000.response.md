### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the annotated code to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
- For each outcome \( i \), if it wins, we receive \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) coins.
- We need to ensure that the sum of all bets is strictly less than \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \) for every winning outcome.

#### Given Code Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \times b|}{\text{gcd}(a, b)} \).
   - It is used within another function to compute the LCM of a list of numbers.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers.
   - It iteratively applies `func_1` to the elements of the list starting from the second element.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main part of the code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes \( n \) and the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - It then calculates the LCM of the multipliers using `func_2`.
   - It distributes the coins such that each outcome gets \( \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \) coins.
   - It checks if the total sum of the distributed coins is less than or equal to the LCM.
   - If the total sum is less than or equal to the LCM, it prints the distribution; otherwise, it prints `-1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The code correctly calculates the LCM of the multipliers.
- It distributes the coins in a way that ensures the total sum of the bets is strictly less than the LCM.
- The logic is sound and meets the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the original assessment is inaccurate. The provided code does indeed solve the problem correctly by ensuring the total bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description.
