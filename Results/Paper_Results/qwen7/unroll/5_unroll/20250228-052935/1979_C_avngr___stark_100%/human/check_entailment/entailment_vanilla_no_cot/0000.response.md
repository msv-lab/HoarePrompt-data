Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the requirements of the problem. The problem requires distributing bets in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each possible winning outcome. The given functions seem to be related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is not relevant to the problem's requirements.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to find a way to distribute the bets such that the total bet is less than the payout for each outcome. Given the constraints, a simple approach would be to set the bet for each outcome to a value that ensures the condition is met. For example, setting the bet for each outcome to 1 would work since the total bet would be `n`, and the payout for each outcome would be at least `k_i`, where `k_i > 1`.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def distribute_bets(n, multipliers):
    if any(multiplier <= 1 for multiplier in multipliers):
        return -1
    # Bet 1 coin on each outcome
    bets = [1] * n
    total_bet = sum(bets)
    for i, multiplier in enumerate(multipliers):
        if total_bet >= multiplier:
            return -1
    return bets

# Reading input
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    multipliers = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = distribute_bets(n, multipliers)
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)) if result != -1 else -1)
```

This code checks if any multiplier is less than or equal to 1, which should never happen according to the problem statement. It then sets the bet for each outcome to 1 and checks if the total bet is less than the payout for each outcome. If it is, it returns the bets; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
