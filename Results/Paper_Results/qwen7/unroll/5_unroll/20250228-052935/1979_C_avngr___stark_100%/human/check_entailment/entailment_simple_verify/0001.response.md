### Reasoning:

The original assessment concluded that the given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. Specifically, the assessment stated that the correct approach is to set \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \) and check if the condition holds. However, let's re-evaluate the program and the problem description more carefully.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
- Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \).
- The goal is to find a distribution \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

#### Given Program Recap:
- The program uses the `func_2` function to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers \( k_i \).
- It then sets \( x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \) for each \( i \).
- If the sum of these \( x_i \) values is greater than or equal to the LCM, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the values of \( x_i \).

#### Detailed Analysis:
1. **LCM Calculation:**
   - The `func_2` function correctly computes the LCM of the multipliers \( k_i \).
   - The LCM is the smallest number that is a multiple of all \( k_i \).

2. **Setting \( x_i \):**
   - The program sets \( x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
   - This ensures that the total amount of coins bet is exactly \( \text{LCM} \).

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if \( \text{LCM} \) is strictly greater than the sum of \( x_i \) values.
   - If \( \text{LCM} > \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \), it prints the \( x_i \) values.
   - If \( \text{LCM} \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \), it prints `-1`.

4. **Correctness:**
   - If \( \text{LCM} \) is the smallest number that is a multiple of all \( k_i \), then \( \text{LCM} \) is indeed strictly greater than the sum of \( x_i \) values when \( x_i = \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} \).
   - This is because \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\text{LCM}}{k_i} = \text{LCM} \cdot \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} \), and since \( \text{LCM} \) is the least common multiple, \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{k_i} < 1 \).

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The original assessment was incorrect because it did not fully understand the mathematical properties of the LCM and the distribution of \( x_i \).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
