#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 2 <= a, b <= 20.
def func_1(a, b):
    return abs(a * b) // gcd(a, b)
    #The program returns the absolute value of the product of a and b divided by their greatest common divisor (gcd), where 2 <= a, b <= 20.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, both within the range of 2 to 20. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`, then computes the absolute value of the product of `a` and `b` divided by their gcd. The function returns this computed value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers where each integer represents the multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome, and the length of the list is \(n\) (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), with each \(k_i\) satisfying 2 ≤ \(k_i\) ≤ 20.
def func_2(numbers):
    result = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        result = func_1(result, num)
        
    #State: The final value of result after applying the function func_1 successively to the elements of numbers starting from the second element.
    return result
    #The program returns the final value of result after applying the function func_1 successively to the elements of numbers starting from the second element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, where each integer represents a multiplier \(k_i\) for the i-th outcome. The length of the list ranges from 1 to 50, and each integer is between 2 and 20. It then applies another function `func_1` successively to these multipliers, starting from the second element of the list, and returns the final result.
