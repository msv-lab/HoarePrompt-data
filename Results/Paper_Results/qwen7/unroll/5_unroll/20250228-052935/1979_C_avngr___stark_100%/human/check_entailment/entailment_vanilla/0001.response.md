Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \).
   - The goal is to find a distribution \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) such that \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i < k_i \cdot x_i \) for all \( i \).

2. **Given Functions:**
   - `func_1(a, b)`: This function calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers using the formula \( \text{lcm}(a, b) = \frac{|a \cdot b|}{\gcd(a, b)} \).
   - `func_2(numbers)`: This function computes the LCM of a list of numbers using the `func_1` function.

3. **Key Observation:**
   - For each outcome \( i \), we need \( \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_j < k_i \cdot x_i \).
   - This implies that \( x_i \) should be chosen such that the sum of all \( x_j \) (for \( j \neq i \)) plus \( x_i \) is less than \( k_i \cdot x_i \).

4. **Approach:**
   - A simple approach is to set \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \). This ensures that the sum of all \( x_j \) is \( n-1 \), which is always less than \( k_i \cdot 1 \) since \( k_i \geq 2 \).

5. **Implementation:**
   - The given functions are not directly used in the solution. Instead, the problem can be solved by setting \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \).

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - If no such distribution exists, the output should be `-1`.

### Correctness Check:

- The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It uses LCM calculations, which are not necessary for the problem at hand.
- The correct solution involves simply setting \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \) and checking if this satisfies the condition.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not solve the problem as described. The correct approach is to set \( x_i = 1 \) for all \( i \) and check if the condition holds.

**Correctness: False**
