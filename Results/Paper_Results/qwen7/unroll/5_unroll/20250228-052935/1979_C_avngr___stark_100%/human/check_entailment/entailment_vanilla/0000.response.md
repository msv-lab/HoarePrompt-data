Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
   - For each outcome \(i\), if it wins, we get \(k_i \times \text{bet}_i\) coins.
   - We need to find a distribution of bets \(\text{x}_1, \text{x}_2, \ldots, \text{x}_n\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{x}_i < k_i \times \text{x}_i\) for all \(i\).

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To ensure the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{x}_i < k_i \times \text{x}_i\) holds for all \(i\), we can set \(\text{x}_i = 1\) for all \(i\). This is because \(k_i \geq 2\) for all \(i\), so \(k_i \times 1 = k_i > 1\) for all \(i\).
   - However, the problem states that if a solution exists, there is always a solution that satisfies the constraints. This suggests we need to find a more general solution.

3. **Given Functions**:
   - `func_1(a, b)` computes the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - `func_2(numbers)` computes the LCM of a list of numbers using `func_1`.

4. **Program Logic**:
   - The program does not actually solve the problem as described. Instead, it computes the LCM of the multipliers \(k_i\).
   - The LCM of the multipliers does not directly help in finding a valid distribution of bets that satisfies the condition \(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{x}_i < k_i \times \text{x}_i\).

5. **Correct Solution**:
   - A correct solution would involve setting \(\text{x}_i = 1\) for all \(i\), as this trivially satisfies the condition since \(k_i \geq 2\).
   - Alternatively, we could use a more complex algorithm to find a valid distribution, but the given functions do not achieve this.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It computes the LCM of the multipliers instead of providing a valid distribution of bets.

**Correctness: False**
