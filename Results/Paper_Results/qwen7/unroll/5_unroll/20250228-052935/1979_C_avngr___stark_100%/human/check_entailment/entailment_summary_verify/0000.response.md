### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided code step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to distribute coins among \(n\) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for each winning outcome.
- Each outcome has a multiplier \(k_i\), and if the \(i\)-th outcome wins, we receive \(k_i \times \text{bet}\).

#### Given Code:
- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function calculates the absolute product of two numbers divided by their GCD. This is used within another function but doesn't seem directly related to the problem.
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function takes a list of integers (multipliers \(k_i\)) and applies `func_1` successively to these multipliers. It returns the final result.

#### Function Summary:
- The summary suggests that `func_2` is supposed to apply `func_1` successively to the list of multipliers. However, the problem requires finding a specific distribution of bets, not just a single value derived from the multipliers.

#### Analysis:
- The core issue with the provided code is that it does not implement the logic required to find a valid distribution of bets.
- The function `func_2` computes a single value based on the multipliers, but this value does not help in determining the actual bets needed to satisfy the problem's condition.
- The problem requires distributing coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for each winning outcome. This involves iterating through each outcome and calculating the appropriate bet, which is not captured by the current implementation.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided code does not solve the problem as described. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address the requirement of distributing coins correctly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
