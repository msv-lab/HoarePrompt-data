You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t, an integer n, and a list of n integers. It calculates and returns a result for each test case based on the XOR properties of the input list and the counts of bit positions in the prefix XOR array. Specifically, it computes the sum of products of counts of zeros and ones for each bit position across the prefix XOR array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly handle the XOR operation and the conditions specified in the problem statement.

The main issues are:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Prefix XORs**: The prefix XOR values are calculated correctly, but they are not used effectively in the subsequent steps to count the valid tuples.

2. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The logic for counting the valid tuples (x, y, z) is flawed. The program attempts to use bit manipulation to count the tuples, but it does not correctly apply the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
3
3
1 2 3
```

Expected output:
```
4
```

However, the program will output an incorrect result because it does not correctly count the valid tuples based on the XOR condition.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to:
1. Calculate the prefix XOR values.
2. Use these prefix XOR values to efficiently count the valid tuples (x, y, z) that satisfy the condition `f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z)`.

Since the provided program does not correctly implement this logic, it is incorrect.
