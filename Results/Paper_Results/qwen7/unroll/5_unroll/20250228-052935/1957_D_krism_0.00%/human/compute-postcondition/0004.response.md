Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for v in arr:`. The objects involved here are `v` and `arr`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `v` is a variable that will take each value from the list `arr` one by one.
   - `arr` is a list of integers.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**:
   - Since `v` will take values from `arr`, we don't need to adjust the state of `v` directly.
   - We need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and the value of `n` is inputted by the user.
- `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers.
- `prefix` is a list containing a single element 0.

We need to focus on adjusting the state of `arr` to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
**`arr` must contain at least one element.**

Final Answer:
State: **`arr` must contain at least one element**
