Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the value of n is inputted by the user.**

The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state, which is a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. The value of `n` is set to the integer input provided by the user, and it is constrained to be between 1 and 10^5.
