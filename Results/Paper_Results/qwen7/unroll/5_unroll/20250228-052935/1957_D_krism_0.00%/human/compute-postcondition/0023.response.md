Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function returns a result for each test case based on the provided data.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a specific number of test cases (t), followed by a series of integers (n) and their respective values (a_i). The function processes these inputs and produces a result for each test case, adhering to the given constraints.
