Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers; `prefix` is a list where each element at index i (starting from 0) is the XOR of all elements in `arr` from index 0 to i.

In simpler terms, the `prefix` list will contain the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to each index.
