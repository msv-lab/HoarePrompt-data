Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the value of n is inputted by the user; `arr` is a list of integers created from the input split and mapped to integers; `prefix` is a list containing a single element 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes the list `prefix` with a single element, which is `0`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
