Output State: **`ans` is 0, `pre` remains unchanged, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf` remain unchanged.**

The code initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other operations are performed, so the values of the other variables (`pre`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `suf`) remain unchanged. The output state reflects these conditions.
