You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . Find the number of tuples (x,
y, z ) such that:

  * 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n , and 
  * f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) . 

We define f(l, r) = a_l \oplus a_{l + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r} , where
\oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the number of
described tuples.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    6 2 4
    
    1
    
    3
    
    5
    
    7 3 7 2 1

Output

    4
    0
    16
    
Note

In the first case, there are 4 such tuples in the array [6, 2, 4] :

  * (1 , 2 , 2 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2) = 4 \oplus 2 > (a_1 \oplus a_2) = 4 
  * (1 , 1 , 3 ): (a_1) \oplus (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 6 \oplus 0 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 2 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2) \oplus (a_2 \oplus a_3) = 4 \oplus 6 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 
  * (1 , 3 , 3 ): (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) \oplus (a_3) = 0 \oplus 4 > (a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus a_3) = 0 

In the second test case, there are no such tuples.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t, an integer n, and a list of n integers. It calculates and returns a result for each test case based on the XOR properties of the input list and the counts of bit positions in the prefix XOR array. Specifically, it computes the sum of products of counts of zeros and ones for each bit position across the prefix XOR array.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initializing Variables:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes a prefix XOR array `prefix` with a leading zero.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation:**
   - The prefix XOR array `prefix` is calculated using the formula \( \text{prefix}[i+1] = \text{prefix}[i] \oplus \text{arr}[i] \).
   - This correctly computes the cumulative XOR up to each index.

3. **Initialization of Pre and Suffix Arrays:**
   - Two arrays `pre` and `suf` are initialized to count the occurrences of each bit being set (1) or not set (0) in the prefix and suffix ranges.
   - `pre` is initialized to have one occurrence of 1 for each bit position (since the prefix at the start is 0, which has all bits unset initially).

4. **Suffix Array Update:**
   - The suffix array `suf` is updated in reverse order, counting the occurrences of each bit being set or not set from the end of the array to the beginning.

5. **Counting Valid Tuples:**
   - For each position `i`, the program calculates the number of valid tuples `(x, y, z)` where \( 1 \leq x \leq y \leq z \leq n \) and \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).
   - It uses the `pre` and `suf` arrays to count the number of valid configurations of bits.
   - The logic seems to be attempting to count pairs of indices where the XOR conditions hold true.

6. **Updating Prefix and Suffix Arrays:**
   - The prefix and suffix arrays are updated as the loop progresses to ensure the counts remain accurate for subsequent iterations.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Bit Counting Logic:**
   - The logic for counting valid tuples using `pre` and `suf` arrays seems flawed. Specifically, the way the counts are updated and used to calculate the number of valid tuples is not correct.
   - The program does not correctly handle the XOR condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \).

2. **Missing XOR Condition Check:**
   - The program does not explicitly check the XOR condition \( f(x, y) \oplus f(y, z) > f(x, z) \) for each tuple `(x, y, z)`. Instead, it relies on the bit counts, which is not sufficient.

3. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program prints intermediate results (arrays and counts) but does not return or print the final result for each test case.

### Conclusion

Given the issues identified, particularly the incorrect handling of the XOR condition and the missing explicit check, the provided program is **incorrect**.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
