Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `while low + 1 < high:`. The variables involved here are `low` and `high`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `low + 1 < high`.

3. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0
   - `high` is `n`
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`
   - `st` is an empty set

4. **Check the condition with current values**:
   - Given `low` is 0 and `high` is `n`, the condition `low + 1 < high` becomes `0 + 1 < n` or `1 < n`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`. We cannot directly change `low` because it is fixed at 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than 1.

Given this analysis, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `high` is greater than 1.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or -1 if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set**
