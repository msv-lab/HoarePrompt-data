Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs (t, n, and p) where t is an integer between 1 and 5000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and p is a list of n distinct integers each between 1 and n, excluding the index position. The function returns a value based on the given conditions.**
