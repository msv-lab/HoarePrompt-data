Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of friends `n` and the list of best friends `l`.

2. **Loop Through Friends**:
   - The program uses a while loop to iterate through the list of friends.
   - It checks if the current friend `i` and their best friend `l[i]` form a specific pattern where `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`.

3. **Pattern Check**:
   - If the condition `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1` is met, the program prints `2` and sets `j` to `1`, breaking out of the loop.
   - If no such pattern is found, the program prints `3`.

### Issues with the Program

1. **Incorrect Pattern Check**:
   - The program only checks for the specific pattern `l[i] == i + 2` and `l[i + 1] == i + 1`. This is too restrictive and does not cover all possible scenarios where at least 2 friends can be invited.

2. **Handling All Test Cases**:
   - The program does not handle all possible configurations of `p_i` values. It assumes a very specific pattern which is not always present in the input data.

3. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**:
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of invitations required is flawed. The program does not consider all possible pairs of friends that can be invited together.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Example 1**:
   - Input: `5`
   - `3 1 2 5 4`
   - The program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 4 and 5 can be invited as they are each other's best friends.

2. **Example 2**:
   - Input: `4`
   - `2 3 4 1`
   - The program prints `3`, but the correct answer should be `3` because friends 1, 2, and 3 can be invited as they form a cycle where each pair of friends can invite each other.

3. **Example 3**:
   - Input: `2`
   - `2 1`
   - The program prints `2`, but the correct answer should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 can be invited as they are each other's best friends.

### Conclusion

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. It only checks for a specific pattern and does not handle all possible configurations of the input data.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
