The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (length of the array), and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It then checks if all elements in the array are non-negative and if certain conditions are met after performing specific arithmetic operations on the array elements. If all conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
