Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and an array a consisting of n integers (0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9). It returns different outputs based on the values of t, n, and the array a.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t`, another integer `n`, and an array `a` of `n` integers. The function processes these inputs and returns results based on the specified conditions and operations, though the exact nature of these operations is not detailed in the given information.
