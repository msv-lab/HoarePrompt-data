Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the described operation. Specifically, the program checks if any element in the array is negative after performing the operations and prints 'NO' immediately if it finds a negative element. However, the problem description allows for multiple operations to be performed until all elements are zero. The program does not ensure that all elements can be reduced to zero through the specified operations. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 3 5 5 2
```
The program will check the first element and since it is not negative, it will proceed to the next elements. However, the correct approach would be to perform the operations iteratively until all elements are zero or determine if it's impossible to make all elements zero. The current implementation does not handle this correctly and will incorrectly print 'NO' for this case.
