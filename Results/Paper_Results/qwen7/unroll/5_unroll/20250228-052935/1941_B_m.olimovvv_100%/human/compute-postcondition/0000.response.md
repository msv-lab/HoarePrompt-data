Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the loop, often representing the current iteration index.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. The input will provide the number of test cases, which we'll call `t`.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute for the given number of test cases. The initial state before the loop starts provides us with the following information:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since the loop will run for each test case, we need to ensure that `t` is correctly set to the number of test cases. Additionally, since the loop itself does not directly use `t`, we don't need to adjust any other variables within the loop body.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
