The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (where \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 9\)), and prints one of four possible outcomes: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', 'NONE', or 'NONE' again depending on the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). It accepts no parameters and does not return any value; instead, it outputs strings based on the conditions met by the input values.
