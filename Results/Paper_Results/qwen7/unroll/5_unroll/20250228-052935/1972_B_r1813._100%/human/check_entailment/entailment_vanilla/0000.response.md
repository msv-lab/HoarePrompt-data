Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - This approach works for reading multiple test cases where each test case is separated by spaces.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program iterates over the test cases.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of coins `n` and the string `s` representing the initial state of the coins.
   - It counts the number of 'U' (up-facing) coins using `count_u = s.count('U')`.

3. **Determining the Winner:**
   - The program checks if the count of 'U' coins (`count_u`) is odd.
   - If `count_u` is odd, it prints "YES" indicating Alice wins.
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO" indicating Bob wins.

### Reasoning:
- The logic in the program correctly identifies whether the number of up-facing coins (`'U'`) is odd or even.
- According to the problem statement, the game's outcome depends on the parity of the number of up-facing coins. If the number of up-facing coins is odd, Alice can always force a win by playing optimally. If it is even, Bob can force a win.

### Testing with Provided Examples:
- **Test Case 1:** `n = 5`, `s = "UUDUD"`
  - Count of 'U': 3 (odd)
  - Output: "YES" (Correct)

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 5`, `s = "UDDUD"`
  - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 2`, `s = "UU"`
  - Count of 'U': 2 (even)
  - Output: "NO" (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the number of up-facing coins. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
