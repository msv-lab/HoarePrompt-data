Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is the first element of `data` converted to an integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only "U" and "D", `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string using whitespace as the delimiter.**

Explanation: The code `index = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. No other variables are affected, so their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
