Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is set to the integer value entered by the user. The variables d1 and d2 are defaultdicts initialized to int, n is an integer, lst is a list of integers, start, end, and inc are integers with specific values based on the loop conditions, s is an integer initialized to 0, and m is an integer. After all iterations of the loop, the values of d1 and d2 are updated based on the calculations within the loop, and the minimum values of s1 and s2 are printed for each query provided by the user.
