Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is set to the integer value entered by the user.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since `t` was initially described as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition, but its exact value depends on the user's input. All other variables (`n`, `a`, and `m`) remain unchanged and still satisfy their respective conditions.
