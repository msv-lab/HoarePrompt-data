You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and t is set to the integer value entered by the user. The variables d1 and d2 are dictionaries initialized with default integer values. For each test case, there is a list of integers (lst) and two dictionaries (d1 and d2) updated based on the minimum differences between adjacent elements. After processing the list, multiple queries (m) are made, each specifying a range [start, end], for which the minimum value between the sums calculated from d1 and d2 is printed for each query.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), a list a of n integers (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), and an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 10^5). Additionally, for each query, it takes two distinct integers x_i and y_i (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n) and returns a result based on these inputs.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
