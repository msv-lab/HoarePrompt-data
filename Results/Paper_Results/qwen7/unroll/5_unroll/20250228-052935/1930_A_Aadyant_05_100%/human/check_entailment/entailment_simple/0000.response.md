Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly read the number of test cases (`t`). It reads a single value for `n` and processes it as if it were a single test case, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.
2. The code reads `n` values at once for a single test case but does not handle multiple test cases as specified.
3. The logic for calculating the maximum score is correct. It sorts the list of numbers and sums up every other number starting from the smallest, which is an optimal strategy for maximizing the score.
4. However, the code should process each test case separately and output the result for each test case.

Given these points, the code is incorrect because it does not properly handle multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`t`) but then processes only one test case without looping over all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
