Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `num` and the expression `range(int(n))`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `num`**: The loop starts with `num` being 0 because `range(int(n))` generates a sequence from 0 to `int(n) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `num` is less than `int(n)`. Therefore, `num` must be initialized to 0 and `int(n)` must be a positive integer.

4. **Adjust the States**: We need to ensure that `num` starts at 0 and `int(n)` is a valid integer within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

Given the initial states:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50
- `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n}` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7
- `final` is an empty list

We need to adjust the states of `num` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `num` is 0
- `n` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50

So, the final state should be:

**State: **`num` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 50**
