Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20), and three strings a, b, and c (each consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters). For each test case, the function returns information based on the given inputs.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns output based on these parameters without accepting any parameters itself.
