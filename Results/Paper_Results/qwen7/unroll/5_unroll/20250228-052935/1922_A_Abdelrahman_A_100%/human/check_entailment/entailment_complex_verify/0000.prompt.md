You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            counter = 0
            for x in c:
                if x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]:
                    no = False
                    print('YES')
                    break
                counter += 1
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, and c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())

        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True

                counter += 1

            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' or 'NO' responses based on the conditions checked within the nested loops. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), it checks if the string `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` matches `a` or `b`, it immediately prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through each character of `c` and checks if it exists in the corresponding positions of `a` and `b`. If a character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b` at the same position, it prints 'YES' and breaks out of the loop. If no such character is found throughout the loop, it prints 'NO'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) of equal length \(n\) (where \(1 \leq n \leq 20\)). It then checks if \(c\) contains any character that is not present in either \(a\) or \(b\). If \(c\) matches \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through each character of \(c\) and checks if it exists in the corresponding positions of \(a\) and \(b\). If a character in \(c\) is not found in both \(a\) and \(b\) at the same position, it prints 'YES' and stops further checks. If no such character is found, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO", which is incorrect according to the problem description. Additionally, the program uses `x not in a[counter] and x not in b[counter]` to check if the character `x` from `c` is not present in the corresponding position of `a` and `b`. This approach is flawed because it only checks for the absence of the character, not its presence in the correct form (lowercase vs. uppercase).

To illustrate the issue, consider the following test case:

```
3
2
aa
bb
AA
```

In this case, both `a` and `b` match the template "AA", but `c` also matches the template "AA" since both `a` and `b` contain 'A' in their respective positions. Therefore, the output should be "YES" because there exists a template "AA" that makes both `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. However, the current implementation would incorrectly print "NO" because `c` is not equal to `a` or `b`.

A correct implementation would involve constructing a template based on the characters in `a` and `b` and then checking if `c` does not match this template.
