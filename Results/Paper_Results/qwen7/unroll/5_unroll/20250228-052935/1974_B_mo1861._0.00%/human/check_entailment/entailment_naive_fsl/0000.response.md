Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded strings. Specifically, the issue lies in the `char_map` construction within the `func_1` function. The mapping is incorrectly created such that characters are mapped to their symmetric positions in the alphabet, but the logic for determining the symmetric character is flawed.

For example, consider the encoded string `b = "ttf"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should consist of all distinct characters of the original string `s`, sorted alphabetically. For `s = "fft"`, the auxiliary string `r` would be `"ft"`. However, the program incorrectly maps characters as follows:
- 't' (which appears twice) should map to 't' (since it's the middle character in "ft").
- 'f' should map to 'f'.

The correct mapping should be:
- 't' -> 't'
- 'f' -> 'f'

But the current implementation maps:
- 't' -> 'f'
- 'f' -> 't'

This is because the program incorrectly calculates the symmetric position using `ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1)`, which does not account for the actual symmetric character in the sorted unique string `r`.

To fix this, the program needs to correctly construct the `char_map` based on the sorted unique characters of the encoded string `b`. Here is a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(b)))
    char_map = {c: r[len(r) - 1 - i] for i, c in enumerate(r)}
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings according to the problem description.
