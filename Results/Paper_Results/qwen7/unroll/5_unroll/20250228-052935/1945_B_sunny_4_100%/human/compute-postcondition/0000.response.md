Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, for each test case, `a`, `b`, and `m` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}; for each test case, `A` is calculated as int(`m`/`a`) + 1, `B` is calculated as int(`m`/`b`) + 1, and the output prints `A` + `B`.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It calculates `A` and `B` based on these values and prints their sum. However, since the actual values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not provided, the only changes made are in the calculation of `A` and `B` within the loop, and the printing of their sum. The initial values of `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` are consumed in each iteration of the loop and replaced by new inputs for the next iteration.
