Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `A` is undefined, `B` is undefined**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input for `t`. However, the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are not yet defined, and therefore, `A` and `B` cannot be calculated at this point. The initial conditions for `t` remain unchanged, and `A` and `B` are left undefined until further inputs for `a`, `b`, and `m` are provided.
