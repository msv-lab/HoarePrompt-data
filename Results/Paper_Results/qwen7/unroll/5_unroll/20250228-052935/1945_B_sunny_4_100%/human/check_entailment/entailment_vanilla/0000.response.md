Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   
2. **Reading Test Case Inputs:**
   - The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem description.

3. **Calculating the Maximum Number of Fireworks Visible Simultaneously:**
   - The formula used in the original code snippet is `A = int(m / a) + 1` and `B = int(m / b) + 1`.
   - These lines calculate how many fireworks from each installation would be visible within the visibility period `m`.
   - The sum `A + B` gives the total number of fireworks visible from both installations within the visibility period.
   - However, this approach does not account for the overlap of fireworks from different installations that might be visible at the same time.

4. **Correct Formula for Overlapping Fireworks:**
   - To find the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`.
   - The LCM of `a` and `b` represents the interval at which fireworks from both installations coincide.
   - The number of fireworks from each installation visible within the LCM interval should be calculated separately and added to the total count.

5. **Revised Calculation:**
   - The revised calculation should be:
     \[
     \text{ans} = \left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor - 1
     \]
   - Here, `\left\lfloor \frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)} \right\rfloor` accounts for the overlapping fireworks.
   - `\left\lfloor \frac{m}{a} \right\rfloor` and `\left\lfloor \frac{m}{b} \right\rfloor` account for the non-overlapping fireworks from each installation.

6. **Implementation in the Given Code:**
   - The given code uses `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the overlapping fireworks.
   - The correct implementation should use the LCM and the above formula.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Therefore, the provided solution is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
