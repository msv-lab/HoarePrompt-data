Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to a test case. For each test case:

- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, the line will contain `k` occurrences of `k` separated by spaces.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, the line will contain `-1`.
- If `k` is less than 2, the line will contain numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces.

Each line corresponds to one test case provided in the input.
