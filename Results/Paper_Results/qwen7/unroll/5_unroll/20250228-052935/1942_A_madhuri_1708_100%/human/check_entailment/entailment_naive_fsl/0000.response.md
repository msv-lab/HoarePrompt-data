Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to generate arrays that meet the requirement of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is not equal to `k`.

For example, consider the test case `n = 4` and `k = 2`. The program will output `-1`, which is incorrect because there exists a valid array that meets the criteria. For instance, the array `[1, 2, 3, 2]` has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: `[1, 2, 3, 2]` and `[2, 3, 2, 1]`.

The program only handles the special case where `k` is equal to `n` by printing a sequence of `k` identical values. However, it does not provide a general solution for other values of `k` and `n`. Therefore, the program is not correct according to the problem description.
