Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to simulate the game and determine the outcome as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the following issues are present:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function is intended to move an object (player or ball) in the field based on the direction specified. However, the function does not handle the boundary conditions of the field (i.e., ensuring the object stays within the field boundaries). Additionally, the function should be used to update the position of players and balls, but it is not integrated into the main logic of the program.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to handle player eliminations when a Bludger hits a player. However, it does not correctly update the state of the game or the positions of the players and balls. It only prints the elimination message and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`, which is not sufficient to manage the game state.

3. **Main Game Logic**: The program lacks the core logic to process the sequence of actions, update the positions of players and balls, check for scoring, and handle eliminations. The functions provided do not interact with the game state in a way that would allow the program to correctly simulate the game.

To correct the program, you need to implement the main game loop, process each action, update the positions and states of players and balls, check for scoring, handle eliminations, and print the appropriate events and final score.
