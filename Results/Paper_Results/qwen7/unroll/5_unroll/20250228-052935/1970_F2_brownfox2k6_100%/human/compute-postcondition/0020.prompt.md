You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list of two integers representing a position on the field, and d is a string representing a direction ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R').
def func_1(obj, d):
    if (d == 'U') :
        obj[0] -= 1
    else :
        if (d == 'D') :
            obj[0] += 1
        else :
            if (d == 'L') :
                obj[1] -= 1
            else :
                if (d == 'R') :
                    obj[1] += 1
                #State: `obj` is a list of two integers where the second element is incremented by 1, given that `d` is 'R'.
            #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers. If the direction `d` is 'L', the second element of `obj` is decremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'R', the second element of `obj` is incremented by 1.
        #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers. If the direction `d` is 'D', the first element of `obj` is incremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'L', the second element of `obj` is decremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'R', the second element of `obj` is incremented by 1.
    #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers. If the direction `d` is 'U', the first element of `obj` is decremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'D', the first element of `obj` is incremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'L', the second element of `obj` is decremented by 1. If the direction `d` is 'R', the second element of `obj` is incremented by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list `obj` of two integers representing a position on the field and a direction `d` as a string ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). It updates the position based on the direction and returns the updated position.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
