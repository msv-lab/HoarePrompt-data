The function processes the current state of players and Bludgers at time `t`. It identifies players whose positions match any Bludger position, marks them as eliminated by updating their positions in the `player` dictionary to `[-1, -1]`, and prints a message for each eliminated player in sorted order of their identifiers. The function does not return a specific value but modifies the `player` dictionary and prints elimination messages.
