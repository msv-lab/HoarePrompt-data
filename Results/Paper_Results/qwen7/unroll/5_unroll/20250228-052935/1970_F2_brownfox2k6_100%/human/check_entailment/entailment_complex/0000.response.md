Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**: The program correctly parses the input to initialize the field, including players, goals, the Quaffle, and Bludgers. It also initializes dictionaries and lists to keep track of player positions and Bludger positions.
2. **Game Execution Loop**: The loop iterates through each step of the game, correctly handling the movement and actions of players and the Quaffle. The logic for catching the Quaffle and throwing it is implemented correctly, updating the player's carrying status and the Quaffle's position accordingly.
3. **Elimination Logic**: The `func_2` function correctly identifies and prints players who are eliminated when they are in the same position as a Bludger. The players are printed in sorted order, which is correct.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The program correctly increments the score for the team that successfully scores in the opponent's goal. The Quaffle is moved to the center of the field after scoring, which is handled correctly.
5. **Final Score Output**: The program outputs the final score at the end of the game, which is correct based on the accumulated scores.

Given that all parts of the program handle the game rules correctly and produce the expected output based on the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
