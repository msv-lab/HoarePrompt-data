### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example given.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of integers from the whiteboard and adding the minimum of each pair to the score.
- The integers are sorted and the pairs are formed such that the smallest numbers are paired together to maximize the score.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer `num`, followed by `2*num` integers.
- It then sorts these integers and calculates the sum of the first elements of each pair in the sorted list.
- This sum is stored in a list `out`.
- After processing all test cases, the function prints each sum in `out`.

#### Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases (`num`) correctly. However, for each test case, it reads the number of elements (`a`) incorrectly as `2*num` instead of `2*a`. This mismatch causes issues because the actual number of elements is `2*a`, not `2*num`.

2. **Sorting and Pairing**:
   - The program sorts the list of integers correctly.
   - It then attempts to form pairs by accessing every second element starting from index 0. This is incorrect because it skips every other element, leading to incorrect pairs.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The program sums the first elements of the incorrect pairs and stores the result in `list2`.
   - This sum is appended to `out`, which is then printed.

Given the example:
```
1
2
2 4
```
- The correct approach would be to pair 2 and 4, giving a score of 2.
- However, the program incorrectly forms pairs (2 and 4), leading to an incorrect result.

The provided solution does not correctly handle the pairing logic and sorting, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

**Final: False**
