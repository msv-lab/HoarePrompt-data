You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are 2n positive integers written on a whiteboard. Being bored, you
decided to play a one-player game with the numbers on the whiteboard.

You start with a score of 0 . You will increase your score by performing the
following move exactly n times:

  * Choose two integers x and y that are written on the whiteboard. 
  * Add \min(x,y) to your score. 
  * Erase x and y from the whiteboard. 

Note that after performing the move n times, there will be no more integers
written on the whiteboard.

Find the maximum final score you can achieve if you optimally perform the n
moves.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq 50
) — the number of integers written on the whiteboard is 2n .

The second line of each test case contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{2n}
(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^7 ) — the numbers written on the whiteboard.

Output

For each test case, output the maximum final score that you can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    1
    
    2 3
    
    2
    
    1 1 2 1
    
    3
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1

Output

    2
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case, you can only make one move. You select x=2 and y=3 ,
and your score will be \min(x,y)=2 .

In the second test case, the following is a sequence of moves that achieves a
final score of 2 :

  * In the first move, select x=1 and y=1 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After erasing x and y , the integers left on the whiteboard are 1 and 2 . 
  * In the second move, select x=1 and y=2 . Then, add \min(x,y)=1 to the score. After removing x and y , no more integers will be left on the whiteboard. 

It can be proved that it is not possible to get a score greater than 2 .

In the third test case, you will perform the move thrice, adding 1 to the
score each time.

- Program:
def func():
    num = input()
    out = []
    for numbers in range(int(num)):
        list2 = []
        list1 = []
        a = input()
        a = int(a)
        b = input('')
        list1 = b.split()
        list1.sort()
        for i in range(a):
            list2.append(int(list1[2 * i]))
        out.append(sum(list2))
        del list1[:]
        del list2[:]
    for outputs in out:
        print(outputs)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `num`, followed by `2*num` integers. It then sorts these integers and calculates the sum of the first elements of each pair in the sorted list. This sum is stored in a list `out`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each sum in `out`. The final state of the program is a list of integers, where each integer represents the sum of the first elements of the pairs from the sorted lists provided for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program reads input in a way that does not match the problem's requirements and does not correctly calculate the maximum final score.

Specifically, the program reads a single integer `num` which is supposed to be the number of test cases, but then it processes the inputs incorrectly. It reads the number of elements in each test case (`a`) and then tries to process pairs of numbers, but it does not handle the sorting and pairing logic correctly.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
1
2
2 4
```

According to the problem description, the optimal strategy would be to pair the smallest numbers together to maximize the sum of the minimums. In this case, pairing 2 and 4 gives a score of 2, which is the maximum possible score.

However, the provided program does not sort the numbers before processing them. Instead, it attempts to split the input into pairs without ensuring that the pairs are optimal. This means the program might not always produce the correct result.

To fix this, the program should:
1. Read the number of elements in each test case.
2. Sort the list of numbers.
3. Pair the smallest numbers together and sum their minimum values.

The provided solution does not follow these steps, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
