### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary to verify the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- An array \( a \) is considered good if there exists an array \( b \) such that:
  1. \(\sum_{i=1}^{m} a_i = \sum_{i=1}^{m} b_i\);
  2. \(a_i \neq b_i\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\);
  3. \(b_i > 0\) for every index \(i\) from 1 to \(m\).

- We need to determine if a subarray of \( c \) is good for each query.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It processes the input and performs the following steps:
     - Reads \( n \) and \( q \).
     - Initializes an array `a` with zeros and fills it with the input values.
     - Initializes an array `b` with zeros.
     - For each index \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), sets `b[i]` to `b[i-1] + x`, where \( x = 1 \) if \( a[i] > 1 \) else \( x = 2 \).
     - Computes the prefix sum of `a` and stores it in `a`.
     - For each query, checks if the sum of the subarray defined by indices \( l_i \) to \( r_i \) in `a` is less than the corresponding sum in `b` and prints 'NO' if true, otherwise prints 'YES'.

2. **Function Summary Recap**:
   - The function processes inputs, calculates cumulative sums in arrays `a` and `b`, and checks subarray conditions.

#### Evaluation Based on Function Summary:
- The function summary states that the function calculates and stores cumulative sums in arrays `a` and `b` and then checks subarray conditions.
- However, the key issue lies in how the arrays `a` and `b` are generated and used:
  - Array `b` is constructed such that each element is either 1 or 2, which does not necessarily ensure that there exists a valid array \( b \) that meets the conditions for a subarray to be good.
  - The program does not actually generate a valid array \( b \) that satisfies the conditions for being good; instead, it generates a simple pattern of 1s and 2s.

#### Correctness Check:
- The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a subarray is good according to the problem description. It generates an array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2, which does not guarantee that the subarray can be transformed into another array \( b \) that satisfies all the conditions.
- For example, consider the subarray \( [1, 2, 1, 4, 5] \). The program generates an array `b` where each element is either 1 or 2, but it does not check if there exists a valid \( b \) that meets all the criteria. For instance, the subarray from index 1 to 3 is \( [2, 1, 4] \), and the program would incorrectly determine it as "YES" because it does not check if there exists a valid \( b \) that meets all the criteria.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly implement the logic to check if a subarray is good according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
