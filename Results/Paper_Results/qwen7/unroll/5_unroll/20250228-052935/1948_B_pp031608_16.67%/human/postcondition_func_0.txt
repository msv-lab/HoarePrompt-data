The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) where each integer is between 0 and 99 inclusive, and the length of the list is between 2 and 50. After sorting the list in ascending order, it checks if the original list is equal to the sorted list. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating the list was already sorted; otherwise, it returns `False`.
