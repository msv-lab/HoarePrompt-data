### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Functionality of `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` checks if a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order. This is a simple check and works correctly for determining if a list is already sorted.

2. **Main Program Logic:**
   - The main program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the array and iterates through the array to check if the condition `list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] > 10` is met.
   - If the condition is met, it attempts to split the element and insert its digits back into the array. However, the logic for splitting and inserting the digits is incorrect.

3. **Incorrect Splitting Logic:**
   - The current implementation does not correctly split the element into its constituent digits. For example, when it encounters `12`, it should split it into `1` and `2` and insert them back into the array. The current logic does not achieve this.
   - The logic `a = list1[p - 1] / 10` and `list1.insert(p - 1, a // 10)` and `list1.insert(p, a % 10)` is incorrect because it does not properly handle the splitting of the number into its digits.

4. **Checking Sorted Condition:**
   - After attempting to split and reorder the elements, the program checks if the array is sorted using `func_1`. However, this check is not sufficient because the array may still not be sorted even after the operations.

Given the above points, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality. It fails to properly split elements greater than 10 and insert their digits back into the array. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the splitting and reinsertion of digits from elements greater than 10.
