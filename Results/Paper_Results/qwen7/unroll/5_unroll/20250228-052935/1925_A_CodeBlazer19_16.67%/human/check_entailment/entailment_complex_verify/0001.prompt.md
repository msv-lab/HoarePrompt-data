You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two positive integers n and k .

Your task is to find a string s such that all possible strings of length n
that can be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a
subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, print the one with the smallest length. If
there are still multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 676 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line of input containing two integers n
(1\leq n\leq 26 ) and k (1\leq k\leq 26 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single string s which
satisfies the above property. If there are multiple answers, print the one
with the smallest length. If there are still multiple answers, you may print
any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 2
    
    2 1
    
    2 2
    
    2 3

Output

    ab
    aa
    baab
    abcbac
    
Note

For the first test case, there are two strings of length 1 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{a}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{b}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the second test case, there is only one string of length 2 which can be
formed using the first lowercase English alphabet, and it is present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}} 

For the third test case, there are 4 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 2 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: \texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{aa}}}\texttt{b} 
  * \texttt{ab}: \texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{ab} 
  * \texttt{bb}: {\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{aa}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}} 

For the fourth test case, there are 9 strings of length 2 which can be formed
using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets, and they are present in s as a
subsequence as follows:

  * \texttt{aa}: {\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{bcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{ab}: {\color{red}{\texttt{ab}}}\texttt{cbac} 
  * \texttt{ac}: \texttt{abcb}{\color{red}{\texttt{ac}}} 
  * \texttt{ba}: \texttt{abc}{\color{red}{\texttt{ba}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{bb}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{c}{\color{red}{\texttt{b}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{bc}: \texttt{a}{\color{red}{\texttt{bc}}}\texttt{bac} 
  * \texttt{ca}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{b}{\color{red}{\texttt{a}}}\texttt{c} 
  * \texttt{cb}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{cb}}}\texttt{ac} 
  * \texttt{cc}: \texttt{ab}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}\texttt{ba}{\color{red}{\texttt{c}}}

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        s = ''
        for j in range(97, k + 97):

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 676, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = ''
        
        for j in range(97, k + 97):
            s += chr(j)

        else:
            print((2 - (n == 1)) * s)
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input value; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, but their values are yet to be determined; After the loop executes all iterations, the output consists of `t` lines, each line containing a string generated based on the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration. If `k == 1`, the line will contain `n` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, the line will contain the string from 'a' to the character corresponding to `k` (inclusive), repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( k \). For each test case, it generates a string based on the values of \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k = 1 \), the string consists of \( n \) repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, the string contains characters from 'a' to the character corresponding to \( k \) (inclusive), repeated \( (2 - (n == 1)) \) times. The function outputs these strings for all test cases.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating the String `s`:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `s`.
   - It then iterates over the ASCII values from 97 (which corresponds to 'a') to `k + 97 - 1`, converting these values to their corresponding characters and appending them to `s`.

3. **Handling Special Cases:**
   - If `k == 1`, the program prints `n * s`. This means it repeats the character 'a' `n` times.
   - Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1)) * s`. This means:
     - If `n == 1`, it prints `s` once.
     - Otherwise, it prints `s` twice.

### Checking Correctness:

1. **Single Character Case (`k == 1`):**
   - When `k == 1`, the string `s` will contain only the character 'a'.
   - The output should be `n * 'a'`, which correctly forms all possible strings of length `n` using only 'a'.

2. **Multiple Characters Case (`k > 1`):**
   - The string `s` will contain the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.
   - The output is either `s` (if `n == 1`) or `s + s` (if `n > 1`).
   - We need to check if this string `s` or `s + s` contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets.

### Verification:

- For `n == 1` and `k > 1`:
  - The string `s` contains `k` characters.
  - All possible strings of length 1 using the first `k` characters are already present in `s`.

- For `n > 1` and `k > 1`:
  - The string `s + s` will have `2k` characters.
  - By repeating `s`, we ensure that every possible combination of length `n` using the first `k` characters appears as a subsequence at least twice, which covers all possible subsequences of length `n`.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles both cases and ensures that all required subsequences are present. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
