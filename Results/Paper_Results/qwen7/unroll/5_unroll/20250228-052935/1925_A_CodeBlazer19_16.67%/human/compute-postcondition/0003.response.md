Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 676, and `t` is now the integer input value; `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 26, but their values are yet to be determined; After the loop executes all iterations, the output consists of `t` lines, each line containing a string generated based on the values of `n` and `k` for each iteration. If `k == 1`, the line will contain `n` repetitions of the character 'a'. Otherwise, the line will contain the string from 'a' to the character corresponding to `k` (inclusive), repeated `(2 - (n == 1))` times.
