The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing exponents. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose three or more identical exponents and pairs of identical exponents, then sums these values. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the calculated value for each test case.
