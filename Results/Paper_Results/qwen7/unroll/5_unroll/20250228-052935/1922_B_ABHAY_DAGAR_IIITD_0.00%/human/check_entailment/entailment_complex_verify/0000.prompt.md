You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have n sticks, numbered from 1 to n . The length of the i -th stick is
2^{a_i} .

You want to choose exactly 3 sticks out of the given n sticks, and form a non-
degenerate triangle out of them, using the sticks as the sides of the
triangle. A triangle is called non-degenerate if its area is strictly greater
than 0 .

You have to calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a
triangle can be formed out of them. Note that the order of choosing sticks
does not matter (for example, choosing the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4 -th stick is the
same as choosing the 2 -nd, 4 -th and 1 -st stick).

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le n ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of ways to choose exactly 3
sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them.

Output

Note

In the first test case of the example, any three sticks out of the given 7 can
be chosen.

In the second test case of the example, you can choose the 1 -st, 2 -nd and 4
-th stick, or the 1 -st, 3 -rd and 4 -th stick.

In the third test case of the example, you cannot form a triangle out of the
given sticks with lengths 2 , 4 and 8 .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the calculated value of `res` for each test case after executing the loop.
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: results is a list of integers where each integer represents the printed value of each result in the original results list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing exponents. For each test case, it calculates the number of ways to choose three or more identical exponents and pairs of identical exponents, then sums these values. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the calculated value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to form a non-degenerate triangle. Specifically, the program calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks without considering the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
4
2 3 2 3
```

The program will output `4` because it counts the combinations of `(2, 3, 2)` and `(3, 2, 3)` as valid triangles, but these do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. The valid combinations are:
- `(2, 2, 3)`
- `(2, 3, 3)`

Thus, the correct output should be `2`, but the program outputs `4`. This shows that the program does not correctly handle the condition for forming a non-degenerate triangle.
