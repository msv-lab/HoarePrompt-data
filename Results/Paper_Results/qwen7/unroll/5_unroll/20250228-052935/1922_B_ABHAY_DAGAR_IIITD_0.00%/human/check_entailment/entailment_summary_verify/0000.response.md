### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given example.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to count the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle.
- A non-degenerate triangle requires that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side.

#### Provided Program:
```python
t = int(input())
func_1(t)

def func_1(test_cases):
    results = []
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n = int(input())
        num_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
        num_of_lens = {}
        for x in num_list:
            if x in num_of_lens:
                num_of_lens[x] += 1
            else:
                num_of_lens[x] = 1
        res = 0
        total_count = 0
        for cnt in num_of_lens.values():
            if cnt >= 3:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6
            if cnt >= 2:
                res += cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count
            total_count += cnt
        results.append(res)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing exponents.
- It calculates the number of ways to choose three or more identical exponents and pairs of identical exponents, then sums these values.
- The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to the calculated value for each test case.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the example provided:
```
3
4
2 3 2 3
```

- The program will output `4` because it counts the combinations of `(2, 3, 2)` and `(3, 2, 3)` as valid triangles, but these do not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. The valid combinations are:
  - `(2, 2, 3)`
  - `(2, 3, 3)`

Thus, the correct output should be `2`, but the program outputs `4`. This shows that the program does not correctly handle the condition for forming a non-degenerate triangle.

However, let's re-evaluate the program with a different perspective. The function summary indicates that the program is counting the number of ways to choose three or more identical exponents and pairs of identical exponents, which is not directly related to forming a non-degenerate triangle. Instead, it seems to be counting the number of ways to choose three sticks regardless of their lengths.

Given the function summary, the program is actually counting the number of ways to choose three sticks, which is not the same as counting the number of ways to form a non-degenerate triangle. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to form a non-degenerate triangle, as demonstrated by the example provided.
