### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its behavior step-by-step based on the problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself as space-separated integers.
   - The array `a` is constructed from the input string `sa`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an argument `c`, which is the length of the array `a`.
   - If `c` is 2, the function prints `4 1` and `1 2`. This corresponds to the example where the array is `[0, 1]` and setting all elements to 2 results in a sum of 4.
   - If `c` is not 2, the function prints `13 0`. This corresponds to the example where the array is `[1, 3, 9]` and no operations are needed to maximize the sum, which remains 13.

3. **Behavior Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` does not process the actual array `a` to find the maximum sum. Instead, it hardcodes the output based on the length of the array.
   - For any array length other than 2, the function always outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect for arrays with different values.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - Consider the input `4 1 100 2 1`. According to the problem, the maximum sum can be achieved by setting all elements to 100, resulting in a sum of 400.
   - However, the program outputs `13 0`, which is incorrect.

5. **General Case:**
   - The program fails to handle any array length greater than 2 and does not consider the actual values of the array elements to determine the optimal operations.
   - The hardcoded outputs do not reflect the correct solution for any arbitrary input array.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem correctly. It hardcodes the output for specific lengths of the array without actually processing the input array to maximize the sum of its elements.

**Final: False**
