Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function `func_1` is hardcoded to handle only the case where the length of the array `n` is 2, and even then, it outputs a fixed result without actually performing any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements. For other lengths of the array, it simply outputs a fixed result of `13 0`, which is incorrect.

To solve this problem correctly, you would need to dynamically determine the optimal operations to perform based on the current values of the array and the definition of MEX. The provided code does not do this and hence is incorrect.
