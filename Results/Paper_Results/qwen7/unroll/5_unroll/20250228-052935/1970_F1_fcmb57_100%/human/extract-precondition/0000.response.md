Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters describing a row of the field. The list has N such strings. The field contains goals for the two teams (RG for a red goal and BG for a blue goal), players (R0-R9 for red team and B0-B9 for blue team), and exactly one Quaffle (.Q). The number of players P satisfies 1 ≤ P ≤ 10. The number of steps T satisfies 0 ≤ T ≤ 10000.**
