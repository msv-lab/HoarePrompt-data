Reasoning:
- The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the new position of a player or an entity after moving in a specified direction.
- The function should return a tuple `(new_x, new_y)` representing the new coordinates after the movement.
- However, the current implementation of `func_1` returns `x`, `y`, `dx`, and `dy` separately instead of returning a single tuple `(x + dx, y + dy)`.
- This discrepancy means that when `func_1` is called in the main program, the returned values are not correctly assigned to update the player's position.

Given the issues with the function `func_1`, the overall logic of updating the player's position and checking for scoring conditions will be incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
