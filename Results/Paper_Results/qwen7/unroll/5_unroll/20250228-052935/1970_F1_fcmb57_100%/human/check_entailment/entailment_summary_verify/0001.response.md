### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly parses the initial grid and extracts the positions of players, goals, and the Quaffle. This part is handled well.

2. **Movement Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function is defined to update the player's position based on the movement direction. However, the function summary provided is incorrect. The function should return a new tuple with the updated coordinates, but the summary suggests it returns multiple variables instead of a single tuple. This discrepancy could lead to issues if the function is called elsewhere in the code with different expectations.
   - The program uses `func_1` to update the player's position correctly, but the function summary does not reflect this correctly.

3. **Scoring Logic**:
   - The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player throws the Quaffle into their opponent's goal, the corresponding team's score is incremented, and the appropriate message is printed. This part is handled well.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The program prints the score updates and the final score in the required format. This part is also handled well.

However, the function summary provided is incorrect. The function `func_1` should return a single tuple with the updated coordinates, but the summary suggests it returns multiple variables. This could lead to potential issues if the function is called elsewhere in the code with different expectations.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the discrepancy in the function summary, although the overall logic of the program seems correct, the function summary provided is misleading. Therefore, we need to consider this discrepancy in our final evaluation.

**Final: False**

The program is logically correct, but the function summary provided is inaccurate, which could lead to potential issues in the future.
