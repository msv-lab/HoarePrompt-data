Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where a player throws the Quaffle and it lands in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player throws the Quaffle into their own goal, the opposing team scores a point. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Specifically, the program only checks if the player's position is in the opponent's goal after the player throws the Quaffle, but it does not update the Quaffle's position to the middle of the field when this happens.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T
```
In this case, the red player throws the Quaffle into the blue goal, but the program does not update the score or print the correct message. The Quaffle should be moved to the middle of the field, and the blue team should score a point. However, the program does not handle this scenario correctly.
