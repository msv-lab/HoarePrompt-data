Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly satisfy the conditions specified in the problem. Specifically, the solution sets \(a_1\) to a fixed value (500) and then calculates subsequent \(a_i\) values as \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\). This approach does not guarantee that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) will hold true for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).

To illustrate why this is incorrect, consider the sample input:
```
4
2 4 1
```

Using the provided solution:
- \(a_1 = 500\)
- \(a_2 = a_1 + x_1 = 500 + 2 = 502\)
- \(a_3 = a_2 + x_2 = 502 + 4 = 506\)

Now, let's check the condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\):
- \(x_2 = 4\), but \(502 \bmod 500 = 2\), not 4.
- \(x_3 = 1\), but \(506 \bmod 502 = 4\), not 1.

Thus, the solution does not meet the required conditions. A correct solution would need to ensure that the modulo operation holds for all \(x_i\).
