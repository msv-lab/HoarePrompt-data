You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array x_2,x_3,\dots,x_n . Your task is to find any array
a_1,\dots,a_n , where:

  * 1\le a_i\le 10^9 for all 1\le i\le n . 
  * x_i=a_i \bmod a_{i-1} for all 2\le i\le n . 

Here c\bmod d denotes the remainder of the division of the integer c by the
integer d . For example 5 \bmod 2 = 1 , 72 \bmod 3 = 0 , 143 \bmod 14 = 3 .

Note that if there is more than one a which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 500) —
the number of elements in a .

The second line of each test case contains n-1 integers x_2,\dots,x_n (1\le
x_i\le 500) — the elements of x .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case output any a_1,\dots,a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ) which
satisfies the statement.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    2 4 1
    
    3
    
    1 1
    
    6
    
    4 2 5 1 2
    
    2
    
    500
    
    3
    
    1 5

Output

    3 5 4 9
    2 5 11
    5 14 16 5 11 24
    501 500
    2 7 5

Note

In the first test case a=[3,5,4,9] satisfies the conditions, because:

  * a_2\bmod a_1=5\bmod 3=2=x_2 ; 
  * a_3\bmod a_2=4\bmod 5=4=x_3 ; 
  * a_4\bmod a_3=9\bmod 4=1=x_4 ;

For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 500, and x is a list of n-1 integers where 1 ≤ x_i ≤ 500 for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n. After executing the loop, a is a list of n integers where a[0] = 500, and for all 1 ≤ i < n, a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1].



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of elements `n` and the list of integers `x`.

2. **Array Initialization:**
   - An array `a` of size `n` is initialized with zeros.
   - The first element `a[0]` is set to 500.

3. **Filling the Array:**
   - For each subsequent element `a[i]` (where `i` starts from 1), the value is calculated as `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the array `a`.

### Verification Against the Problem Statement:

- **Constraints:**
  - The constraints are satisfied as the program handles up to `t = 10^4` test cases and `n = 500` elements per test case.
  - The input values are within the specified ranges.

- **Modulo Condition:**
  - The program ensures that `x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}` for all `2 \le i \le n`.
  - Given `a[i] = a[i - 1] + x[i - 1]`, we have:
    \[
    a_i = a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}
    \]
    Therefore,
    \[
    a_i \bmod a_{i-1} = (a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}) \bmod a_{i-1} = x_{i-1}
    \]
    This matches the required condition \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\).

- **Initial Value:**
  - The initial value `a[0] = 500` is arbitrary but ensures that the modulo operation works correctly for the first element.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly initializes the array `a` such that the modulo condition is satisfied for all `2 \le i \le n`. The choice of `a[0] = 500` is valid and ensures the correctness of the solution.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
