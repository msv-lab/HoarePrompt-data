Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the length of the string, and `a`, a list of non-negative integers of length `n` where each element `a_i` represents the number of previous indices with the same character as the `i`-th index in the string. After processing, it constructs and returns a string `s` containing characters from 'a' to 'z'. Each character in `s` appears a number of times specified by the corresponding value in `char_count`, which is derived from the input list `a`.**
