You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the two
versions is the constraint on y . In this version y = 0 . You can make hacks
only if both versions are solved.

Bessie has received a birthday cake from her best friend Elsie, and it came in
the form of a regular polygon with n sides. The vertices of the cake are
numbered from 1 to n clockwise. You and Bessie are going to choose some of
those vertices to cut non-intersecting diagonals into the cake. In other
words, the endpoints of the diagonals must be part of the chosen vertices.

Bessie would only like to give out pieces of cake which result in a triangle
to keep consistency. The size of the pieces doesn't matter, and the whole cake
does not have to be separated into all triangles (other shapes are allowed in
the cake, but those will not be counted).

Bessie has already chosen x of those vertices that can be used to form
diagonals. She wants you to choose no more than y other vertices such that the
number of triangular pieces of cake she can give out is maximized.

What is the maximum number of triangular pieces of cake Bessie can give out?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case consists of three integers, n , x , and y (4
\leq n \leq 10^9 , 2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5) , y = 0 ) — the number
of sides of the polygon, number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the maximum
number of other vertices you can choose.

The second line consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n , representing the
vertices Bessie has chosen.

It is guaranteed the sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5
.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum number of non-
intersecting triangular pieces of cake she can give out.

Example

Input

    3
    
    8 4 0
    
    1 6 2 5
    
    8 8 0
    
    1 3 2 5 4 6 7 8
    
    4 2 0
    
    1 3

Output

    2
    6
    2
    
Note

In test cases 1 , 2 and 3 , you can get 2 , 6 and 2 non-intersecting
triangular pieces of cake, respectively. A possible construction is shown in
the following pictures:

The green dots represent vertices that can be used, the blue lines represent
diagonals that are drawn, and the red numbers represent triangles that are
counted.

            if num == 1:
                count += 1
        num = list0[0] + n - list0[-1] - 1
        if num == 1:
            count += 1
        print(count + x - 2)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates a specific value based on a given list of integers. It sorts the list and counts the number of gaps of exactly 1 between consecutive elements, and additionally counts one more gap if the gap between the smallest element in the list and 1, or between the largest element and n, is exactly 1. Finally, it prints the result for each test case, which is the count plus \(x - 2\), where \(x\) is the number of elements in the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input.
   - It then reads a list of `x` integers representing the chosen vertices.

2. **Sorting the Chosen Vertices:**
   - The list of chosen vertices is sorted. This step is necessary to correctly calculate the gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.

3. **Calculating Gaps Between Chosen Vertices:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted list of chosen vertices to calculate the number of gaps between consecutive chosen vertices.
   - If the gap between two consecutive chosen vertices is exactly 1, it increments the `count` variable. This is because a gap of 1 means there is a vertex that can be used to form a triangle with the chosen vertices.

4. **Handling the Circular Nature of the Polygon:**
   - After the loop, the program calculates the gap between the first and last chosen vertices, considering the circular nature of the polygon. If this gap is exactly 1, it increments the `count` variable.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - The final number of triangles is calculated as `count + x - 2`. This formula accounts for the initial `x - 2` triangles formed by the chosen vertices and any additional triangles formed by the gaps.

### Analysis:

- The logic for calculating the gaps between chosen vertices is correct.
- The handling of the circular nature of the polygon is also correct.
- The final calculation of the number of triangles is correct.

Given that the program follows the correct logic as described in the problem statement, it should produce the correct output for the given constraints.

### Conclusion:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.
