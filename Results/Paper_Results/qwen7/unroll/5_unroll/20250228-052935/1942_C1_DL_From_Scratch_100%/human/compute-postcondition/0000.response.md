Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 10^4, inclusive, which is the number of test cases.**

Explanation: The code `T = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `T`. Since `T` was initially a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\), and the input function reads an integer, the value of `T` remains within the same range. All other conditions and variables mentioned in the initial state remain unchanged because they are not involved in the given code snippet.
