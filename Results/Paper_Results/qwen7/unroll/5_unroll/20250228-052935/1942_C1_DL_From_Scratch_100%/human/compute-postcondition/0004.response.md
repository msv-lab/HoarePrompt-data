Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it receives n, x, and y as positive integers (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y = 0). Additionally, it receives a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n representing the vertices Bessie has chosen. The function returns a result based on the given conditions for each test case.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return value are not specified in the provided information, only the parameters and their constraints.
