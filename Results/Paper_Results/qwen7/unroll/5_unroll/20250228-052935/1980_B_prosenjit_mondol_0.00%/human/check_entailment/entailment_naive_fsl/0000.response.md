Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube is removed but the comparison is made with the wrong element in the sorted array. Specifically, the program checks if `a[k] > x` or `a[k] < x`, which is incorrect. It should check if the value at the `k`-th position after sorting is less than or equal to the value of the favorite cube. Additionally, the logic for determining whether the favorite cube is removed needs to consider the position of the favorite cube in the sorted array.

Here is an example where the program fails:

Consider the input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```

The sorted array would be `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`. The favorite cube (with value 3) is at index 1. After removing the first 2 cubes, the array becomes `[3, 3, 3, 2]`. In this case, the program incorrectly prints "NO" because it compares the value at index 2 (`3`) with the value of the favorite cube (`3`), which should be "MAYBE" because the favorite cube could still be in the array after removal.

To fix this, the program should correctly determine the position of the favorite cube in the sorted array and then check if it falls within the range of cubes being removed.
