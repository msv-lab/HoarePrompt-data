The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and ensures it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It then constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` based on the sorted balance values of "(" and ")" up to each index in `s`. The balance values are sorted primarily by the number of ")" and secondarily by the negative index. The function returns the new string `ans`.
