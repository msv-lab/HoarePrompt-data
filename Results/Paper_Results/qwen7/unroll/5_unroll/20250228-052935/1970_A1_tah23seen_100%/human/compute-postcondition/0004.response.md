Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each value of `i` from `0` to `len(s) - 1`. This means `i` will take on values starting from `0` up to `len(s) - 1`.

3. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - `i` should start from `0` because the loop starts iterating from the first character of the string `s`.
   - `n` is the length of the string `s`, which is already given as `n`.

4. **Check if the Loop Can Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` starts at `0` and `n` is the length of `s`, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than `0`.

5. **Adjust the States**:
   - We need to ensure that `i` is `0` at the start of the loop.
   - We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than `0` so that the loop can execute.

6. **Consider Other Variables**:
   - The variables `s`, `ans`, and `d` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
