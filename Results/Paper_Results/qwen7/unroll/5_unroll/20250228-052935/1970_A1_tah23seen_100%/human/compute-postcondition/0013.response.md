Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The function returns a string `ans` that is formed by concatenating all characters from `s` based on the sorted balance values in dictionary `d`. The balance values are sorted based on the tuple `(x[1], -x[0])` for each item `x` in `d`, where `x[0]` represents the count of '(' and `x[1]` represents the count of ')' up to that index in `s`.**
