#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n (inclusive) contains an integer value representing the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is the string resulting from concatenating all characters from `s` based on the sorted balance values in `d`. `n` is the length of `s`. `ans` is equal to `s`. `d` is a dictionary where each key from 0 to n-1 (inclusive) contains an integer value representing the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`, sorted based on the tuple `(x[1], -x[0])` for each item `x` in `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns the string `ans` which is equal to `s`, where `s` is the string resulting from concatenating all characters from the original string based on the sorted balance values in dictionary `d`. The balance values are sorted based on the tuple `(x[1], -x[0])` for each item `x` in `d`, where `x[0]` represents the count of '(' and `x[1]` represents the count of ')' up to that index in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` consisting only of "(" and ")" and ensures it is a balanced parentheses sequence. It then constructs a new string `ans` by concatenating the characters from `s` based on the sorted balance values of "(" and ")" up to each index in `s`. The balance values are sorted primarily by the number of ")" and secondarily by the negative index. The function returns the new string `ans`.
