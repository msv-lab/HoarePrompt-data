Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm" representing a valid time. It returns information based on the given conditions.**

Note: The provided code snippet does not include the actual logic to process `t` and `s`, so the functionality described here is based on the constraints and expected output cases.
