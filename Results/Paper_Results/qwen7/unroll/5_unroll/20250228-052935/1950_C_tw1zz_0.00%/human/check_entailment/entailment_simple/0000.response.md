Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. It splits the input string `s` into hours `h` and minutes `m`.
3. The logic for converting 24-hour format to 12-hour format is implemented using a series of conditional statements. However, this approach can be optimized.
4. The program correctly handles the conversion of hours from 00 to 23 to 12-hour format and assigns the appropriate "AM" or "PM".
5. The minutes are handled correctly and remain unchanged.
6. The output format matches the required format "hh:mm AM/PM".

However, there is a more efficient way to handle the conversion of hours from 24-hour to 12-hour format, which can reduce redundancy in the code. Instead of using multiple `if-elif` statements, we can use arithmetic operations to achieve the same result.

Despite this optimization, the current implementation still works correctly for all valid inputs as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
