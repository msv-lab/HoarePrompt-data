The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) within the range 0 to 9. For each test case, it prints 'STAIR' if \(a < b < c\), 'PEAK' if \(a < b > c\), and 'NONE' otherwise. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.
