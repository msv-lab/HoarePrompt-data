Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates through each test case and reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
3. The conditions for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented:
   - For a stair, the condition `a < b < c` is checked.
   - For a peak, the condition `a < b > c` is checked.
4. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
5. The program does not return any value but prints the results directly, which matches the requirement.

Given that the conditions and logic are correctly implemented according to the problem statement, the program should work as expected.

Correctness: **True**
