Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`). If either condition is met, it prints the corresponding string ("STAIR" or "PEAK").
4. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".
5. The logic in the program matches the problem description perfectly.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
