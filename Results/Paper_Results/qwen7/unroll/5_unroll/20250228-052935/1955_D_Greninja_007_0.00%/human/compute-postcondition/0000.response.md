Output State: **`good_subarrays` is 0, `a` is a list of integers with length n, `b` is a list of integers with length m such that m <= n, and k is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= m.**

The code initializes the variable `good_subarrays` to 0. No other changes are made to the variables `a`, `b`, or `k`. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.
