Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It uses a sliding window approach with frequency counters to efficiently count the number of good subsegments of array `a` for each test case. The function `func_1` correctly updates the frequency counter for the current window and adjusts the match count accordingly as it slides through the array. The overall structure and logic of the program are sound and should produce the correct results for the given problem constraints.
