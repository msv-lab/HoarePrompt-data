Reasoning:
1. The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. It attempts to sum the digits of all integers from 0 to `n-1` for each test case, which is not what the problem asks for.
2. According to the problem statement, Vladislav writes integers from 1 to `n` on the board and then replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. The program should compute the sum of these new values, not the sum of the digits of all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
3. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a given integer `n`, but it is being called incorrectly in the main part of the program.

Given the above points, the program is incorrect because it does not follow the problem's instructions properly.

Correctness: **False**
