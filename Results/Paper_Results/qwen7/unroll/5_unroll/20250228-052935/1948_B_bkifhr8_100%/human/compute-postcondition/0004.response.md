Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ 99). For each test case, the function processes the integers a_1 through a_n and returns the results accordingly.**
