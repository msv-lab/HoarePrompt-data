### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies several critical issues with the provided program. Let's reiterate and expand on these points to ensure a thorough evaluation:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Splitting and Checking**:
   - The program attempts to split the digits of the previous element and append the current element, but it does not actually perform the operation of inserting the digits back into the array. This means the program only checks if the hypothetical combination of digits is sorted, which does not reflect the actual transformation of the array.
   - The check `if nums != sorted(nums)` is insufficient because it only verifies if the combined list of digits is sorted, but it does not simulate the operation of splitting and inserting the digits back into the array.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Array Transformation**:
   - The program does not modify the original array to reflect the digit-splitting operation. Instead, it only checks if the hypothetical combination of digits is sorted, which does not guarantee that the array can be sorted by the given operation.
   - The program should simulate the operation of splitting and inserting the digits back into the array and then check if the resulting array is sorted.

3. **Misunderstanding of the Problem**:
   - The problem requires transforming the array by repeatedly applying the operation of splitting and inserting digits until the array is sorted. The program does not correctly simulate this process.

### Detailed Evaluation

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of each array along with the array elements.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The boolean variable `ans` is initialized to `True`, assuming the array can be sorted initially.

3. **Loop Through Array Elements**:
   - The program iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking if the current element is less than the previous element.

4. **Digit Splitting and Sorting Check**:
   - If the current element is less than the previous element, the program splits the previous element into its digits and appends the current element.
   - It then checks if the combined list of digits is sorted.
   - If not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

5. **Output**:
   - Finally, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".

### Conclusion

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not correctly implement the required operation and cannot accurately determine if the array can be sorted. The program only checks if the hypothetical combination of digits is sorted, which does not reflect the actual transformation of the array. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
