Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `i`: This variable is used in the `range` function to iterate over a sequence of numbers.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts (since `range(int(input()))` generates a sequence from 0 up to but not including the value of `int(input())`.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not known yet because the input hasn't been provided, but we know it should be an integer between 1 and 1000 based on the problem statement.

3. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0 and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the value of `int(input())`, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the value of `int(input())` is greater than 0.

4. **Consider other given variables**:
   - `t`: This variable is not directly involved in the loop condition and its value doesn't affect the loop execution.
   - `n`: This variable is defined within the loop body and is not part of the loop head.
   - `s`: This variable is also defined within the loop body and is not part of the loop head.

Given this analysis, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be greater than 0**
