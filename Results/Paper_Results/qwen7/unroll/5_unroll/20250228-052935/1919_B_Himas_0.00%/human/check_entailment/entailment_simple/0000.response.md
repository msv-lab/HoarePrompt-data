Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum possible penalty for splitting an array `a` derived from a string `s` into non-empty subarrays.
2. The penalty is calculated as the absolute value of the sum of each subarray multiplied by its length.
3. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to minimize the penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and prints their difference (`P - M`). This approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.
4. For example, consider the input `-----` (which corresponds to the array `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`). The solution would output `5`, but the optimal split is `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`, resulting in a penalty of `5` (as each subarray has a penalty of `1`).
5. Another example is `+-+-+-` (which corresponds to the array `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`). The solution would output `0`, but the optimal split is `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`, resulting in a penalty of `0`.
6. Therefore, the provided solution does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
