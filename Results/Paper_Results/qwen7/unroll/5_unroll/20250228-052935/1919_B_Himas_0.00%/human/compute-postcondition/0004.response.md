Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a string `s` consisting of '+' and '-' characters. It then counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in `s`, calculates the difference between these counts, and prints the result for each test case.**
