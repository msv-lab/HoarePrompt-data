Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and s is a string consisting of '+' and '-' characters with length n. After the loop executes all iterations, for each test case, P and M are integers representing the count of '+' and '-' characters in the string s respectively, and the output is the result of P - M printed for each test case.
