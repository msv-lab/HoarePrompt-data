Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to minimize the penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program needs to compute the optimal way to split the array to achieve the minimum penalty.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `s` itself.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two counters `P` and `M` to count the occurrences of `+` and `-` respectively.
   - It iterates through each character in the string `e` (which is the input string `s`).
   - If the character is `+`, it increments `P`.
   - If the character is `-`, it increments `M`.

3. **Output:**
   - The program prints the difference between `P` and `M`.

### Reasoning:
- The program does not actually split the array `a` into subarrays.
- It only counts the number of `+` and `-` in the string `s`.
- The difference `P - M` is printed as the result.

### Example Analysis:
Let's consider the example cases provided:

1. **Input:**
   ```
   5
   1
   +
   5
   -----
   6
   +-+-+
   10
   --+++++++-
   20
   +---++++-+++++---++
   ```

2. **Expected Output:**
   ```
   1
   5
   0
   4
   4
   ```

3. **Actual Output:**
   - For the first test case (`1 +`), the output is `1 - 0 = 1`.
   - For the second test case (`-----`), the output is `0 - 5 = -5` (should be `5`).
   - For the third test case (`+-+-+`), the output is `3 - 2 = 1` (should be `0`).
   - For the fourth test case (`--+++++++`), the output is `4 - 6 = -2` (should be `4`).
   - For the fifth test case (`+---++++-+++++---++`), the output is `8 - 12 = -4` (should be `4`).

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly solve the problem because it does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty. It simply counts the number of `+` and `-` and outputs their difference, which is not the correct approach.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
