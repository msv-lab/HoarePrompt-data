### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. The program simply counts the number of `+` and `-` characters in the string `s` and outputs their difference, which is not the correct approach to minimize the penalty.

To properly solve the problem, we need to consider how to optimally split the array `a` derived from the string `s` to minimize the penalty. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. An optimal strategy would involve splitting the array at points where the sum changes sign, effectively minimizing the penalty.

However, the provided program does not implement any such strategy. Instead, it just counts the number of `+` and `-` characters, which does not take into account the structure of the array or the penalty calculation.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not implement the necessary logic to find the optimal way to split the array and calculate the minimum penalty.
