You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing the result of the operations performed within the loop for each test case. These integers are calculated based on the sorting and comparison operations between lists `a` and `c` for each test case. Specifically, the output for each test case will either be 0 (if certain conditions are met), or the sum of maximum absolute differences calculated during the sorting and comparison process.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\), where \(a_i\) is the original array and \(c_i\) is the chosen array from the set of integers \(b_i\).

### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads \(n\) and \(m\).
   - It then reads the array \(a\) of size \(n\).
   - Finally, it reads the array \(c\) of size \(m\).

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If both arrays \(a\) and \(c\) have the same unique value, the difference \(D\) will be zero. This is correctly handled by checking `if len(set(a)) == 1 and len(set(c)) == 1 and (a[0] == c[0]):`.

3. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - The array \(a\) is sorted in ascending order.
   - The array \(c\) is sorted in descending order.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to traverse the sorted arrays.
   - For each element in \(a\), it calculates the absolute differences with the corresponding elements in \(c\) from both ends (smallest and largest remaining values in \(c\)).
   - It adds the maximum of these two differences to the total difference \(ans\).

5. **Handling Single Element Arrays:**
   - If \(a\) has only one element, it calculates the maximum difference between this element and the maximum and minimum elements in \(c\).

### Correctness Check
- **Edge Cases:**
  - The program correctly handles the case where both arrays have the same unique value.
- **Sorting and Pointer Logic:**
  - Sorting \(a\) in ascending order and \(c\) in descending order ensures that the maximum possible differences are considered.
  - Using two pointers to traverse the arrays and choosing the maximum difference at each step is a valid approach to maximize the total difference.
- **Single Element Arrays:**
  - The handling for single-element arrays is also correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\).

### Conclusion
The program is correct based on the provided problem description and examples.

**Correctness: **True**
