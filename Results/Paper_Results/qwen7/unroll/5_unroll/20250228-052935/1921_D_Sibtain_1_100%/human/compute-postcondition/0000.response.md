Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value that determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the initial state**: We know that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means that `int(input())` will read an integer from the input, and this integer should be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

3. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, the input value must be within the specified range. Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that the input value is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value that will determine the number of iterations of the loop.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100 (this ensures the loop can execute)**

Note: Since `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, we don't need to explicitly mention `t` in the final state as it is already given in the problem statement. The key adjustment is ensuring that the input value is within the required range.
