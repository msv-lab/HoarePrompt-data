Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b` (renamed as `c` in the code).
3. It checks if both arrays `a` and `c` contain identical elements. If they do, it prints `0` because no difference can be achieved.
4. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. Sorting in these specific orders helps maximize the differences between corresponding elements.
5. It iterates through the elements of `a` and compares them with elements from `c` in a way that maximizes the differences. This is done by choosing the maximum possible difference at each step.
6. The final result is printed for each test case, which is the sum of the maximum differences calculated during the iteration.

Given the logic and the steps taken in the code, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem statement. It handles all the necessary conditions and constraints mentioned in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
