Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the arrays `a` and `c` contain elements that are not sorted in a way that maximizes the total difference. Specifically, the program sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order, which may not always yield the maximum possible difference.

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
4
3 4
1 1 1
1 2 3 4
```
- Expected Output:
```
6
```
- Program Output:
```
3
```

In this case, the program sorts `a` as `[1, 1, 1]` and `c` as `[4, 3, 2, 1]`. It then calculates the differences as follows:
- For the first element: `|1 - 4| = 3`
- For the second element: `|1 - 3| = 2`
- For the third element: `|1 - 2| = 1`

The total difference calculated by the program is `3 + 2 + 1 = 6`.

However, the optimal solution would be to assign the smallest element of `c` to the largest element of `a` and vice versa. In this case, the optimal assignment would be:
- Assign `1` from `c` to `3` in `a`: `|3 - 1| = 2`
- Assign `2` from `c` to `2` in `a`: `|2 - 2| = 0`
- Assign `3` from `c` to `1` in `a`: `|1 - 3| = 2`

The total difference in this case is `2 + 0 + 2 = 4`, but the program does not consider this optimal assignment.

Therefore, the program does not always produce the maximum possible difference, making it incorrect.
