Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to process each one.
2. **Identical Elements Check**: The check for identical elements in `a` and `c` is handled correctly. If they are identical, the function prints `0`, which is the correct result since no difference can be achieved.
3. **Sorting**: The function sorts `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order. This is a good strategy to maximize the differences because the smallest element in `a` will be paired with the largest element in `c`, and vice versa.
4. **Calculation of Differences**: The function iterates through the sorted lists and calculates the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements. It accumulates these differences into `ans`.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as when `len(a) == 1` separately, which ensures that the logic for calculating the differences is robust.

Given the above points, the function appears to implement the logic correctly according to the problem statement and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
