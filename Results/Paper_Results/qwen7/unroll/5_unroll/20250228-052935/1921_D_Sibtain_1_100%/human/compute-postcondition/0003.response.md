Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It validates that t is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, ensuring the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Additionally, it checks that a_i and b_i are integers within the range of 1 to 10^9. The function returns the processed results based on these conditions.**
