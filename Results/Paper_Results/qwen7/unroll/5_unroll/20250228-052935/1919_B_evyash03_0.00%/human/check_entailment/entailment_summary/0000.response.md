Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` represented by the string `s`.
2. The given program attempts to solve this by counting how many times the balance (sum of the array elements) goes negative during a single pass through the string.
3. However, the logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which does not align with the problem's requirements.
4. The function should aim to minimize the sum of penalties, where the penalty for each segment is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The current implementation does not achieve this goal.
5. The function also incorrectly handles the final balance; it should consider the final balance to determine the last segment's penalty but does not do so in a way that minimizes the overall penalty.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
