Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty by optimally splitting the array `a` derived from the string `s`.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve the problem using a different approach. Instead of directly calculating the penalty, it tries to count the number of times the balance goes below zero while iterating through the string `s`. This approach seems to be an attempt to optimize the splitting process.
3. However, the logic in `func_1` does not correctly compute the minimum penalty. Specifically, it does not account for the actual penalties of the subarrays formed during the optimal splitting process.
4. The function `func_1` returns the number of times the balance goes below zero plus one if the final balance is greater than zero. This logic does not align with the problem's requirements for calculating the minimum penalty.
5. The function does not consider the lengths of the subarrays or their sums, which are crucial for calculating the penalty as per the problem statement.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
