### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- The goal is to split the array \(a\) (represented by the string `expression`) into non-empty subarrays such that the total penalty is minimized.
- The penalty of a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
- The program should output the minimum possible penalty.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the string `expression` and the string itself.
   
2. **Splitting the String:**
   - The string `expression` is split into parts using the delimiter `'-'`.
   - This results in `parts` being a list of substrings separated by `'-'`.

3. **Calculating Result Length:**
   - `result_length` is computed as the sum of the lengths of these parts.
   - This step seems unnecessary since the length of the string `expression` is already known.

4. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes the string `expression` and the length of the string `length`.
   - It initializes `count` to 0 and `balance` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character in `expression`:
     - If the character is `'+'`, `balance` is incremented.
     - If the character is `'-'`, `balance` is decremented.
     - If `balance` becomes negative, `count` is incremented, and `balance` is reset to 0.
   - Finally, it returns `count + (balance > 0)`.

#### Key Issues:
- **Incorrect Calculation of Penalty:**
  - The function `func_1` does not calculate the actual penalties for the subarrays.
  - Instead, it simply counts the number of times the balance goes below zero, which is not related to the problem's requirements.
  
- **Optimal Segmentation:**
  - The program does not attempt to find the optimal way to split the array to minimize the total penalty.
  - It only splits the string based on `'-'` and counts the number of segments, which does not align with the problem's requirements.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
10
--+++++++-
```
- The string `expression` is `"--+++++++-"`.
- The parts after splitting are `["--", "+++++++", "-"]`.
- The length of the string is 10.
- `func_1` will count the number of times the balance goes below zero, which happens twice (at the start and after the first segment).

Thus, `func_1` returns `2 + (1 > 0) = 3`, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, one would need to use dynamic programming or a greedy algorithm to find the optimal way to split the array such that the total penalty is minimized. The current implementation does not achieve this.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as required by the problem statement.

**Final: False**
