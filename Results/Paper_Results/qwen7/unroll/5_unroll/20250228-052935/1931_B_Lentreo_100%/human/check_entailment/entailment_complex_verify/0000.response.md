### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its logic against the problem statement and the example cases.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container stored in the list `nums`.

2. **Sum Check**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water `total` and checks if it is divisible by `n`.
   - If `total % n != 0`, the program immediately returns "NO". This is correct because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water per container as `mean = total // n`.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the containers and maintains a running sum `curr` of the differences between the current amount of water and the mean.
   - If at any point `curr < 0`, it returns "NO" because it would indicate that the cumulative difference from the mean has become negative, making it impossible to redistribute the water evenly.
   - If the loop completes without returning "NO", it returns "YES".

### Evaluation Using Annotated Code:

- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `43`
  - Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: Since there is only one container, it trivially holds the same amount of water.

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `1 3`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: The total amount of water is `4`, but since `4 % 2 != 0`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly.

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `4 5 2 1 3`
  - Output: `YES`
  - Explanation: The total amount of water is `15`, and `15 % 5 == 0`. The mean is `3`. By redistributing the water, we can achieve `3` units in each container.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `1 2 3`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: The total amount of water is `6`, but since `6 % 3 == 0`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly because the differences do not balance out.

- **Test Case 5**:
  - Input: `4 5 5 0 6 4 4`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: The total amount of water is `28`, and `28 % 7 == 0`. However, the differences do not balance out, making it impossible to distribute the water evenly.

- **Test Case 6**:
  - Input: `6 5 5 1 3 4 4`
  - Output: `NO`
  - Explanation: The total amount of water is `24`, and `24 % 7 == 0`. However, the differences do not balance out, making it impossible to distribute the water evenly.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The program handles all the given test cases correctly, and the logic is sound.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.
