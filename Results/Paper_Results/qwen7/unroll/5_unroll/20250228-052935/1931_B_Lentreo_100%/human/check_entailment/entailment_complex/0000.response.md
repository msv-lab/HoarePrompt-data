Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
2. The solution logic is as follows:
   - Calculate the total amount of water and check if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, return 'NO'.
   - Calculate the mean amount of water per container.
   - Iterate through the list of water amounts and keep track of the cumulative difference between the current sum and the expected sum (if all containers had the mean amount of water).
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, return 'NO' because it would imply an impossible redistribution.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'NO', return 'YES'.

Given the annotated program, the function `func_1` correctly implements the above logic. It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers and then ensures that redistributing the water to achieve the mean amount in each container is feasible without encountering a negative cumulative difference.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided states.

Correctness: **True**
