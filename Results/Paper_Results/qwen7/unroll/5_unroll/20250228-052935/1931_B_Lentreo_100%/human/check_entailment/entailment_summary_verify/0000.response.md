### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its function `func_1` against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the amounts of water in each container.

2. **Sum Check**:
   - The program calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. This is a crucial step because the problem guarantees that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water per container, which is `total // n`.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the containers and ensures that the cumulative difference from the mean remains non-negative. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

However, there is a subtle issue in the balance check part of the program. The variable `curr` is initialized to 0, and it accumulates the difference between the current water amount and the mean. If `curr` becomes negative at any point, it means that the cumulative water amount in some containers has already exceeded the required mean, making it impossible to distribute the water evenly.

To ensure correctness, let's consider the following points:

- **Correctness of the Sum Check**:
  - The sum check is correct and necessary because if the total amount of water is not divisible by `n`, it is impossible to distribute the water evenly.

- **Correctness of the Mean Calculation**:
  - The mean calculation is straightforward and correct.

- **Correctness of the Balance Check**:
  - The balance check is intended to ensure that the cumulative difference from the mean remains non-negative. However, the way `curr` is used might not fully capture the requirement. Specifically, the check should ensure that the cumulative difference from the mean is always non-negative after each adjustment, not just before the next adjustment.

Given the problem statement and the function summary, the program seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if the water can be distributed evenly. The balance check ensures that the cumulative difference from the mean remains non-negative, which is a necessary condition for even distribution.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: True**

The program is correct based on the given problem description and the function summary. The original assessment was accurate.
