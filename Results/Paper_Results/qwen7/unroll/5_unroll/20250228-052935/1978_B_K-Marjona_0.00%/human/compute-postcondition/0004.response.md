Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) (where \( 1 \le n, a, b \le 10^9 \)). For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of an arithmetic sequence or a simple product based on the values of \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, if \( b > a \), it computes the sum of the first \( k \) terms of an arithmetic sequence starting from \( b \) with a common difference of 1, plus the product of \( a \) and the remaining terms, where \( k \) is the minimum value between \( n \) and \( b - a \). If \( b \le a \), it simply prints \( a \times n \). The function outputs the results for all test cases.**
