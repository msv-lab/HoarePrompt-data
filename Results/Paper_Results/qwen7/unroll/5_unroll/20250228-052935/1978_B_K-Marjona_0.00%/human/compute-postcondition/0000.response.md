Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition directly.
   - The expression `int(input())` is what determines whether the loop will execute. Specifically, the loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer.

3. **Initial State Before the Loop**: The initial state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases. This means that `t` itself is a positive integer.

4. **Loop Execution Condition**: For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a positive integer. Since `t` is already a positive integer indicating the number of test cases, each input from `int(input())` must also be a positive integer.

5. **Adjusting the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that each input from `int(input())` is a positive integer. Given that `t` is a positive integer, we can assume that the loop will run `t` times, each time expecting a positive integer input.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed are:
- `t` should remain a positive integer.
- Each call to `int(input())` must return a positive integer.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer, and each call to `int(input())` must return a positive integer**
