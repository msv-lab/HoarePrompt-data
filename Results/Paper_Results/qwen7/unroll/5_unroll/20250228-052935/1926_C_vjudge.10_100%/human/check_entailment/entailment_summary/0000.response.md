Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. The provided solution uses a precomputed array `values` where `values[i]` stores the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to \( i \). This approach significantly reduces the time complexity for each query.
3. The function `func_1()` initializes the array `values` and populates it in a single loop. It then processes each test case by reading the input `n` and printing `values[n]`.
4. The logic for computing the sum of digits of each number from 1 to \( i \) is correctly implemented inside the nested loops.
5. The solution handles the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) efficiently by using dynamic programming to store intermediate results.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the solution according to the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
