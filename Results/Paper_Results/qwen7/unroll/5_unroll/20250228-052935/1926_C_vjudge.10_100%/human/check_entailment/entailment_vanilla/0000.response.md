Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program initializes `inf` to \(2 \times 10^5 + 1\), which is a large enough value to cover all possible inputs.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It creates an array `values` of size `inf` initialized to 0.

2. **Precomputing Sums of Digits:**
   - For each integer `i` from 1 to `inf`, the program calculates the sum of the digits of `i` and stores the cumulative sum in the `values` array.
   - This is done using nested loops where the outer loop iterates through each number and the inner loop calculates the sum of the digits of the current number.

3. **Handling Test Cases:**
   - For each test case, the program reads the value of `n` and prints `values[n]`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Memory Usage:**
   - The program precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\). This is highly inefficient and unnecessary because we only need the sum for numbers up to the maximum `n` in any test case.
   
2. **Time Complexity:**
   - Precomputing the sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\) takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, which is not efficient given the constraint of 0.5 seconds per test case.

3. **Redundant Computation:**
   - The program computes the sum of digits for every number from 1 to \(2 \times 10^5\), even though it only needs to compute up to the maximum `n` for each test case.

### Correct Approach

A more efficient approach would be to directly compute the sum of the digits for each number up to `n` without precomputing for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\).

### Corrected Program

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    n_values = []
    for i in range(1, t*2, 2):
        n_values.append(int(data[i]))
    
    results = []
    for n in n_values:
        total_sum = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            sum_value_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(i))
            total_sum += sum_value_digits
        results.append(total_sum)
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

func_1()
```

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the original program is incorrect due to its inefficiency and redundancy. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
