Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5, `inf` is 200001**.

The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `t`. The value of `n` and `inf` remains unchanged from their initial state. The range constraints for `t` and `n` are preserved, but the exact value of `t` is now determined by user input.
