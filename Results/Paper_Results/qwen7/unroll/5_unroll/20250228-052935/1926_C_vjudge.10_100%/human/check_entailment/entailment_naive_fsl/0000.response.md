Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. The program uses a precomputed array `values` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\). However, this approach is inefficient and does not handle the problem as described. 

The problem requires calculating the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case. The given implementation reads the test cases but does not correctly compute the sum of digit sums for each \(n\).

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- For \(n = 12\), the correct sum of digit sums is \(51\).
- However, the program will use the precomputed array `values`, which is not updated dynamically for each test case. Instead, it will simply read the value from the array, which is incorrect because the array is not being used to compute the sum of digit sums for the specific \(n\) provided in the test case.

A correct implementation would involve computing the sum of digit sums for the range from 1 to \(n\) directly for each test case, rather than relying on a precomputed array.
