Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
A square of positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area is located on the
coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. You are given
the coordinates of its corners, in random order. Your task is to find the area
of the square.

Input

Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer t
(1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of testcases. The following is a description
of the testcases.

Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i
(-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000 ), coordinates of the corners of the square.

It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate
axes, with positive (strictly greater than 0 ) area, with corners in given
points.

Output

For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, there are four lines, each containing two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. It is guaranteed that the given points form a valid square.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        x1, y1 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x2, y2 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x3, y3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        x4, y4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if x1 == x3 and x2 == x4:
            if y1 < y3:
                res = abs(y3 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y3)
        elif x1 == x2 and x3 == x4:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        elif x1 == x4 and x3 == x2:
            if y1 < y2:
                res = abs(y2 - y1)
            else:
                res = abs(y1 - y2)
        
        print(res ** 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of results, each being the square of the absolute difference in y-coordinates for specific pairs of points, based on the conditions provided within the loop. Each result is printed after the corresponding iteration of the loop. The number of results will be equal to the number of test cases (denoted by `a`).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case involves four coordinates forming a square. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference in y-coordinates for specific pairs of points and prints the square of this difference. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.
