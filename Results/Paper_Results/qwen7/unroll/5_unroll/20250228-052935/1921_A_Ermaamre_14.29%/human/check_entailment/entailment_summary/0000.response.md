Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to calculate the area of a square given the coordinates of its corners. However, the logic in the program is flawed. Specifically:

1. The program checks for specific pairs of points to determine which sides of the square are vertical or horizontal, but it does not account for all possible configurations of the square's corners.
2. The program only considers three specific pairs of points for calculating the side length of the square, which is insufficient to handle all possible configurations of the corners.
3. The program does not correctly identify the side length of the square. It assumes that the difference in y-coordinates between two specific points will always give the side length, which is not always true.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to:
- Identify the side length of the square by finding the maximum difference in either the x-coordinates or y-coordinates among all pairs of points.
- Calculate the area of the square by squaring the side length.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
