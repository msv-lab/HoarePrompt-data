#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a list of integers, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, and the length of the list n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Additionally, the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and for each test case, an integer m is given such that 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6.
def func_1(num):
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(num) - 1, -1, -1):
        if num[i] == '0':
            counter += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: counter is the number of '0' characters from the end of the list num.
    return counter
    #The program returns the number of '0' characters from the end of the list num.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `num` and returns the count of trailing zeros (i.e., '0' characters) at the end of the list. If the list does not contain any '0' characters at the end, it returns 0.
