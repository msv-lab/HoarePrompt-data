Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly counts the number of trailing zeros in a string representation of an integer. It iterates through the string from the last character to the first, counting zeros until it encounters a non-zero digit.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program initializes `total_digits` to count the total number of digits in the list of numbers.
   - It also initializes `zeros` to store the count of trailing zeros for each number.
   - For each number, it calculates the count of trailing zeros using `func_1` and appends it to the `zeros` list.
   - The `zeros` list is then sorted in descending order.
   - The program iterates over the sorted `zeros` list in steps of 2, summing up the values. This step is intended to simulate Sasha's strategy of concatenating pairs of numbers.
   - Finally, it checks if the absolute difference between `total_digits` and `subtract_zero` is greater than or equal to `m + 1`. If true, Sasha wins; otherwise, Anna wins.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The logic for counting trailing zeros and sorting them is correct.
   - The main condition check (`abs(total_digits - subtract_zero) >= m + 1`) is designed to determine the winner based on the total digits and the sum of selected trailing zeros.
   - The program correctly handles the input and output format specified in the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program should handle cases where the list might be empty or contain only one element.
   - The logic for Sasha's strategy seems to be based on the assumption that he can always concatenate pairs of numbers to form a large enough number to win. However, the implementation does not explicitly account for all possible scenarios where Anna might force Sasha into a losing position.

Given the provided execution summary and the logic in the program, the program appears to follow the rules and conditions of the game correctly. Therefore, the program is logically sound and should work as intended under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
