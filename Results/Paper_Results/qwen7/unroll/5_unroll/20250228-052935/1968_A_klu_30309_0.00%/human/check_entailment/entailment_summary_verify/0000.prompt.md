You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

  Args:
    x: The given integer.

  Returns:
    The optimal y.
  """
    max_val = 1
    for y in range(x - 1, 1, -1):
        if x % y == 0:
            if 2 * y >= x:
                return y
            max_val = y
    return max_val



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `x` such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and returns the largest divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to half of `x`. It iterates through possible values of `y` starting from `x - 1` down to 2, checking if `y` is a divisor of `x` and if `2 * y` is greater than or equal to `x`. If both conditions are met, it returns `y`; otherwise, it continues the search and updates the maximum value found. If no suitable `y` is found, it returns the maximum value found during the iteration.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not always find the correct value of \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). Specifically, consider the case when \( x = 1000 \):

- The program will check values of \( y \) from \( 999 \) down to \( 2 \).
- For \( y = 999 \), \(\gcd(1000, 999) = 1\), so \(\gcd(1000, 999) + 999 = 1000\).
- However, for \( y = 500 \), \(\gcd(1000, 500) = 500\), so \(\gcd(1000, 500) + 500 = 1000\).

In this case, both \( y = 999 \) and \( y = 500 \) give the maximum value of \( 1000 \), but the program returns the first \( y \) that satisfies the condition, which is \( y = 999 \). This means the program does not necessarily find the maximum possible value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for all inputs.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure it finds the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) by checking all possible \( y \) values and keeping track of the maximum value found.
