Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where the road can be placed before the first house or after the last house correctly. According to the problem description, if the road is placed before the first house, the entire village is on the left side, and if it is placed after the last house, the entire village is on the right side. However, the program does not account for these scenarios properly.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
000
```
The expected output is `0` because the road should be placed before the first house, making all houses on the left side. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and might output `1` instead.

Additionally, the program does not correctly handle the case where the road is placed after the last house. For instance, in the input:
```
3
111
```
The expected output is `2`, but the program might not handle this case correctly and could output `1` instead.

These issues indicate that the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
