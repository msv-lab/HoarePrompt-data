### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly initializes variables to count zeros and ones on both sides of the potential road placement.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.

2. **Counting Zeros and Ones**:
   - The first loop counts the number of zeros and ones in the first half of the string `s` (up to the middle).
   - The second loop counts the number of zeros and ones in the second half of the string `s`.

3. **Adjusting Counts for Optimal Position**:
   - The function then iteratively adjusts the counts as it moves the potential road position from the middle towards the start and end of the string.
   - For each position, it checks if the current configuration satisfies the condition of having at least \(\lceil \frac{x}{2} \rceil\) residents on each side being satisfied.

4. **Finding the Optimal Position**:
   - The function determines the optimal position by comparing the distances from the middle of the village and selecting the position that minimizes \( \left| \frac{n}{2} - i \right| \).

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the road might be placed before the first house or after the last house.
   - It ensures that the final position is the one closest to the middle of the village.

### Verification:

- The logic for counting zeros and ones and adjusting them as the potential road position changes seems correct.
- The conditions for checking satisfaction are correctly implemented.
- The handling of edge cases and the determination of the optimal position appear to be correctly managed.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
