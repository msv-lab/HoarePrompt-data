Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution attempts to find a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. However, the implementation has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Use of DSU for Cycle Detection**: The DSU is used to find cycles, but the logic to detect cycles and ensure they are simple is flawed. Specifically, the code does not correctly handle the detection of simple cycles and does not ensure that the cycle found is indeed simple (i.e., no repeated vertices).

2. **DFS for Cycle Extraction**: The DFS function is used to extract the cycle, but it does not ensure that the cycle is simple. It simply returns the path from `node_u` to `node_v` without checking for repeated vertices.

3. **Edge Sorting and Union-Find**: The edges are sorted in reverse order, and the union-find operations are performed. This approach can lead to incorrect results because it does not guarantee finding the smallest simple cycle. The algorithm should prioritize finding simple cycles directly rather than relying on sorting and union-find to indirectly find them.

4. **Handling of Colors Array**: The `colors` array is used to mark nodes, but it is not correctly utilized to ensure the cycle is simple. The code does not check for repeated vertices in the DFS traversal.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to use a more sophisticated approach such as Depth-First Search (DFS) combined with cycle detection techniques to ensure the cycle is simple and the edge weights are minimized. Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Graph:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.n = n
        self.graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    def add_edge(self, u, v, w):
        self.graph[u].append((v, w))
        self.graph[v].append((u, w))

    def dfs(self, u, parent, path, visited, min_weight, result):
        visited[u] = True
        path.append(u)
        
        for v, w in self.graph[u]:
            if not visited[v]:
                if self.dfs(v, u, path, visited, min_weight, result):
                    result.append((u, v, w))
                    min_weight[0] = min(min_weight[0], w)
                    return True
            elif v != parent and w == min_weight[0]:
                result.append((u, v, w))
                return True
        
        path.pop()
        return False

def find_min_weight_simple_cycle(n, edges):
    g = Graph(n)
    for u, v, w in edges:
        g.add_edge(u, v, w)
    
    min_weight = float('inf')
    result = []
    for u in range(1, n+1):
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        path = []
        if g.dfs(u, -1, path, visited, [float('inf')], result):
            min_weight = min(min_weight, result[-1][2])
            break
    
    return min_weight, len(result), ' '.join(map(str, [u for u, _, _ in result]))

# Function to read input and process test cases
def func_7():
    test_cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        edges = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(m)]
        min_weight, k, cycle = find_min_weight_simple_cycle(n, edges)
        print(min_weight, k)
        print(cycle)

func_7()
```

This solution uses DFS to find simple cycles and ensures that the cycle is simple by checking for repeated vertices. It also correctly finds the cycle with the minimum weight edge.
