Based on the initial state provided:

- `_min_edge` remains positive infinity (`float('inf')`)
- `node_u` and `node_v` remain `-1`
- `colors` is a list of length `n+1` where all elements are `0`
- `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call `dfs(node_u, -1, [])`

Let's break down the `print(_min_edge, len(res))` statement:

1. `_min_edge` is explicitly stated to be `float('inf')`.
2. `res` is the result of the `dfs` function call with parameters `node_u`, `-1`, and `[]`. Since `node_u` and `node_v` are both `-1`, it implies that no valid DFS path was found, and thus `res` would be an empty list or `None`. However, without more context about the `dfs` function, we can assume `res` is an empty list if no valid path exists.

Therefore, `len(res)` will be `0`.

Putting this together:

Output: **float('inf'), 0**
