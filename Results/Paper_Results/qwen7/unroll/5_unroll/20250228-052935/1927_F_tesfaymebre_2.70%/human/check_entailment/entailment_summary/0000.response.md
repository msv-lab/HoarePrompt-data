Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a simple cycle with the minimum weight of the lightest edge in an undirected weighted graph.
2. The provided code includes a series of functions that collectively solve the problem:
   - `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` handle reading input from stdin.
   - `func_6` constructs the graph and applies Kruskal's algorithm to find the required cycle.
   - `func_7` performs a DFS to identify the cycle.
   - `func_8` processes multiple test cases using the above functions.

3. Let's analyze each part:
   - `func_4` correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, `n`, and `m`.
   - `func_5` reads the first line of each test case, which contains `n` and `m`.
   - `func_3` and `func_4` correctly parse the input for `u`, `v`, and `w` for each edge.
   - `func_6`:
     - Constructs the graph using an adjacency list.
     - Sorts the edges in descending order by weight.
     - Uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum weight edge that connects two nodes in the same connected component.
     - Performs a DFS to find the cycle involving this edge.
   - `func_7` correctly implements the DFS to find the cycle.
   - `func_8` iterates over each test case, calling `func_6` to process each one.

4. All functions work together to read input, construct the graph, apply Kruskal's algorithm, and find the desired cycle. The code handles the constraints and guarantees provided in the problem statement.
