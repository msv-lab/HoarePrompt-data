#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a graph represented by weighted edges and a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. It first constructs an adjacency list representation of the graph and a list of edges sorted in descending order by weight. Then, it uses Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum weight edge that connects two nodes already belonging to the same connected component, updating the DSU structure accordingly. After identifying this edge, it performs a depth-first search (DFS) starting from one of the nodes involved in this edge to determine a path. Finally, it prints the weight of the identified edge and the sequence of nodes visited during the DFS traversal. If no such edge exists, it prints infinity and an empty list.

    #The program returns an empty list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: an integer `curr` representing the current vertex, an integer `parent` representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and a list `path` representing the current path being explored. It performs a depth-first search to explore the graph. If the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1, the function returns the current path `path`. Otherwise, it continues exploring the graph and returns an empty list if no cycle is found or if the current vertex leads to no valid path.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a specified number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `m` lines of three integers `u`, `v`, and `w` representing edges in a graph. After processing all test cases, it sets `test_cases` to 0. The function does not return any value.
