Output State: **_min_edge remains positive infinity (float('inf')), node_u and node_v remain -1; colors is a list of length n+1 where all elements are 0, res is the result of the dfs function call dfs(node_u, -1, [])**.

In natural language: The minimum edge (_min_edge) remains positive infinity, node_u and node_v remain unchanged at -1. The colors list still has a length of n+1 with all elements being 0. The variable res now holds the result of the dfs function call with arguments node_u, -1, and an empty list.
