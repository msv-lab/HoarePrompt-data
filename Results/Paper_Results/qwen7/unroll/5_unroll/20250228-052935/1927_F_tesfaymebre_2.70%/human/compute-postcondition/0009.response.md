The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: `curr`, `parent`, and `path`. `curr` is an integer representing the current vertex, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex in the DFS traversal, and `path` is a list representing the current path being explored. 

- In Case_1, if the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1, the function returns the list `path`, which represents the current path being explored during the DFS traversal and includes the current vertex `curr`.
- In Case_2, if the condition for returning the list `path` is not met, the function returns an empty list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `dfs` is to accept an integer `curr`, an integer `parent`, and a list `path`, and return the list `path` if the current vertex `curr` has a color of 1, otherwise return an empty list.
