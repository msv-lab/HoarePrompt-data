Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input string `s` and calls the function `func_1(s)`.
2. The function `func_1` computes the balance of the parentheses sequence and stores these balances in a dictionary `d`.
3. It then sorts the keys of the dictionary `d` based on their corresponding balance values, breaking ties by the original position in descending order.
4. Finally, it constructs the balanced shuffle sequence by concatenating characters from the original string `s` at the sorted positions.

Given the steps and the logic, the program should correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
