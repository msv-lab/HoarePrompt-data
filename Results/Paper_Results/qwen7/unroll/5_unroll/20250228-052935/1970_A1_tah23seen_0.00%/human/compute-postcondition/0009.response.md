Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains two variables: `i` and `j`.

2. **Understand the context**: The loop iterates over pairs `(i, j)` where `i` and `j` are elements of the list `d`. Each element `d[i]` represents the balance of parentheses up to position `i` in the string `s`.

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `d`.
   - Since `d` is sorted based on the balance values, the list `d` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `s` is a string consisting only of characters `(` and `)`, and its length is `n`. This information does not directly affect the loop's execution but is part of the overall context.
   - `n` is the length of `s`, which is used to determine the range of indices in `d`.
   - `ans` is an empty string, which is not directly relevant to the loop's execution.
   - `d` is a list of balances, and it must contain at least one element for the loop to execute. The specific values of `i` and `j` inside the loop will be determined by the elements in `d`.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that the list `d` must contain at least one element.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`d` must contain at least one element**
