Output State: **`t` is an input integer, buffer is an empty list, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `buffer`. The initial values of `t` and the conditions related to `n` and the list of integers remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains these preconditions while updating that `buffer` is now an empty list.
