Output State: **t is an input integer, and for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, and a list contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The other parts of the initial state remain unchanged.
