The function accepts a list `a` of `n` integers, where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and each integer from 1 to `n` appears at most twice in the list. It creates a dictionary `count_a` to count the occurrences of each integer in `a`. Then, it calculates `max_score` as the number of integers in `a` that appear exactly twice. Finally, it returns `max_score`.
