Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum possible score you could achieve if you play optimally, but it does not account for Nene's optimal strategy to minimize your score. Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Score**: The function `func_1` simply counts how many numbers appear twice in your hand and assumes that you can always get those points. However, this does not consider Nene's strategy to minimize your score.

2. **Lack of Strategy for Nene**: The problem states that Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score while minimizing yours. The current implementation does not simulate this behavior.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game considering both players' strategies. Here’s a revised approach:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Count how many times each number appears in your hand.
2. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate each turn where you and Nene play optimally. For each of your turns, check if placing a card on the table would give you a point. For Nene's turns, ensure she plays to maximize her score and minimize yours.

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count occurrences of each number in your hand
    count_a = {}
    for num in a:
        if num in count_a:
            count_a[num] += 1
        else:
            count_a[num] = 1
    
    # Initialize the table and scores
    table = set()
    your_score = 0
    nene_score = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    for i in range(n):
        # Your turn
        for num in a:
            if num in count_a and count_a[num] > 0:
                if num in table:
                    your_score += 1
                table.add(num)
                count_a[num] -= 1
                break
        
        # Nene's turn
        for num in range(1, n + 1):
            if num in count_a and count_a[num] > 0:
                if num in table:
                    nene_score += 1
                table.add(num)
                count_a[num] -= 1
                break
    
    results.append(your_score)
    
for res in results:
    print(res)
```

This code simulates the game by considering both players' optimal strategies and correctly calculates the maximum score you can achieve.
