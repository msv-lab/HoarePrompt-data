Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not simulate the game correctly. According to the problem description, Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score. However, the current implementation of `func_1` only calculates the maximum possible score you can achieve based on the initial distribution of cards, without considering Nene's optimal strategy.

To illustrate this, consider the following example:

**Input:**
```
1
4
1 1 2 3
```

**Expected Output:**
```
1
```

However, the program outputs:
```
0
```

This happens because the program simply counts how many pairs of cards you have, which does not account for Nene's optimal strategy. In the given example, Nene would play one of the cards with a value of 1 first, preventing you from scoring any points. Therefore, the program does not correctly simulate the game according to the problem description.
