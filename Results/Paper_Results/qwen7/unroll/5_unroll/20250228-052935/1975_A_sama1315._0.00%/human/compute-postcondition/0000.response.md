Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6 for all i, and `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` simply reassigns the `input` variable to refer to the `sys.stdin.read` method. This does not change the values of `t`, `n`, or `arr`. It just changes what `input` refers to.
