Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Specifically, `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted or if there is exactly one pair of elements that are out of order. However, the problem requires checking if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order, which is more complex than just checking for one out-of-order pair.

For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. According to the problem statement, this array cannot be made non-decreasing by any number of splits and swaps, but `func_1` would incorrectly return `'Yes'` because it only checks for one out-of-order pair. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases.
