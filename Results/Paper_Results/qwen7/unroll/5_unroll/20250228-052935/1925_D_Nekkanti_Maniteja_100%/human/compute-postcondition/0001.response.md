Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5·10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ min(10^5, n(n-1)/2), and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·10^5. Additionally, a is an integer, c is calculated as (n * (n - 1) // 2)^(-1) modulo 10^9 + 7, s is calculated as c * i * c * m + c * a summed up to k, and the final output is s modulo 10^9 + 7.
