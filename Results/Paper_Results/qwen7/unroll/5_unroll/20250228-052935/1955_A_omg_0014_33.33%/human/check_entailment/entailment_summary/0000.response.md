Reasoning:
1. The problem requires calculating the minimum cost for buying \( n \) yogurts, considering both the regular price and the promotion price.
2. The given program incorrectly uses \( c \) instead of \( b \) when calculating \( d \). It should be using \( b \) to represent the price of two yogurts.
3. The logic inside the loop should compare the total cost of buying yogurts individually at price \( a \) with the total cost of buying pairs of yogurts at price \( b \).
4. The comparison should consider how many pairs of yogurts can be bought and how many individual yogurts remain after buying those pairs.
5. The current implementation does not account for the optimal way to buy the yogurts, leading to incorrect results.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to find the minimum cost.

Correctness: **False**
