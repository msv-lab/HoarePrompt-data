Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop that runs `n` times, reading three integers `(a, b, c)` for each test case.
   
2. **Calculating Promotion Price per Yogurt:**
   - The variable `d` is calculated as `c / 2`, which is the price for one yogurt under the promotion.

3. **Comparison Logic:**
   - The program compares `a * b` (the total cost without promotion) with `a * d` (the total cost with promotion).
   - If `a * b` is less than `a * d`, it prints `a * b`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `round(a * d)`.

4. **Promotion Consideration:**
   - The logic assumes that if the promotion price per yogurt (`d`) is cheaper than the regular price (`b`), it will always be better to buy in pairs.
   - However, this logic does not account for the optimal way to use the promotion. For example, if `n` is odd, buying `n-1` yogurts in pairs and the last one at the regular price might be cheaper.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the examples provided:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 2`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Regular price for 2 yogurts: `2 * 5 = 10`
  - Promotion price for 2 yogurts: `9`
  - The program prints `9` which is correct.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 9`
  - Regular price for 3 yogurts: `3 * 5 = 15`
  - Promotion price for 3 yogurts: `9 * 1.5 = 13.5` (rounded to 14)
  - The program prints `14` which is correct.

- **Test Case 3:** `n = 3`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Regular price for 3 yogurts: `3 * 5 = 15`
  - Promotion price for 3 yogurts: `11 * 1.5 = 16.5` (rounded to 17)
  - The program prints `15` which is correct.

- **Test Case 4:** `n = 4`, `a = 5`, `b = 11`
  - Regular price for 4 yogurts: `4 * 5 = 20`
  - Promotion price for 4 yogurts: `11 * 2 = 22` (rounded to 22)
  - The program prints `20` which is correct.

### Conclusion

The program correctly handles the basic comparison between the regular and promotion prices. However, it does not account for the optimal way to use the promotion when the number of yogurts is odd. This means it may not always give the minimum cost for all test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal way to use the promotion when the number of yogurts is odd.
