Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each of these `t` test cases, it processes three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 30). The function does not specify a direct return value in the given information, so it likely prints or processes the results for each test case without returning a value.**
