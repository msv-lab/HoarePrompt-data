Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, each containing either `1` or `n`. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, the value printed depends on the condition `k >= n - 1`. If the condition is true, `1` is printed; otherwise, `n` is printed. The specific values of `n` and `k` for each iteration are provided by user input.
