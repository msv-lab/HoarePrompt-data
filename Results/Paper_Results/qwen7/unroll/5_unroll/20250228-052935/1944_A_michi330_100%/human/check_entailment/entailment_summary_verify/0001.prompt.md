You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes up to 1000 test cases, where each test case consists of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). For each test case, it checks if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \). If true, it prints 1; otherwise, it prints \( n \). The function outputs a line for each test case, resulting in a total of up to 1000 lines of output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Bridge Destruction Logic:**
   - The program checks if `k` (the number of bridges that can be destroyed) is greater than or equal to `n - 1`.
     - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This means that if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, Everule can only stay on island 1.
     - Otherwise, it prints `n`, meaning that Everule can still visit all `n` islands.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The logic seems to handle the edge cases where `k` is large enough to isolate Everule from all other islands.
   - However, we need to verify if this logic correctly handles all scenarios, especially when `k < n - 1`.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **Case 1: `n = 2`, `k = 0`**
   - Expected Output: `2`
   - Explanation: No bridges can be destroyed, so Everule can visit both islands.
   - Program Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Case 2: `n = 2`, `k = 1`**
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: One bridge can be destroyed, isolating one island.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

3. **Case 3: `n = 4`, `k = 1`**
   - Expected Output: `4`
   - Explanation: Even with one bridge destroyed, Everule can still visit all four islands through alternative paths.
   - Program Output: `4` (Correct)

4. **Case 4: `n = 5`, `k = 10`**
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: Since `k` is equal to the maximum possible bridges (`10`), all bridges can be destroyed, isolating Everule.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

5. **Case 5: `n = 5`, `k = 3`**
   - Expected Output: `5`
   - Explanation: With three bridges destroyed, Everule can still visit all five islands.
   - Program Output: `5` (Correct)

6. **Case 6: `n = 4`, `k = 4`**
   - Expected Output: `1`
   - Explanation: All bridges can be destroyed, isolating Everule.
   - Program Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, the logic appears to be correct. The program correctly handles the scenarios where `k` is sufficient to isolate Everule and where it is not.
