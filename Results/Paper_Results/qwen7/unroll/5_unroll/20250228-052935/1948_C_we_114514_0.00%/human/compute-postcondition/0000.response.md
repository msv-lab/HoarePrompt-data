Output State: **`results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No other variables are affected, and the precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains unchanged. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, and the strings representing the arrows in the grid are not altered by this line of code.
