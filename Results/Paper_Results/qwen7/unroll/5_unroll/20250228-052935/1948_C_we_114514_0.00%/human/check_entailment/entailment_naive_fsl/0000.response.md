Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly when the robot needs to move between the two rows. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

For the input:
```
4
>>><
><>>
```
The program should output `YES` because the robot can move from (1,1) to (2,1), then to (2,2), and finally to (2,4).

However, the program logic does not correctly handle the transition from the first row to the second row. Specifically, the program only checks if the next cell in the second row has a `>` arrow when transitioning from the first row, but it does not ensure that the robot can actually make the transition from the first row to the second row.

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the issue:
- The program initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
- It iterates through each column `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- If `reachable_first_row` is `True`, it checks if the current cell in the first row has a `>` arrow. If it does, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the next cell in the second row also has a `>` arrow.
- If `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it checks if the current cell in the second row has a `>` arrow. If it does, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True` if the next cell in the second row also has a `>` arrow.

This logic fails to account for the possibility that the robot might need to move back to the first row before reaching the last column in the second row. A correct solution would need to ensure that the robot can transition between the two rows and reach the last column in the second row.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible transitions between the two rows correctly.
