Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in how it determines whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n). Specifically, the logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` is not correctly implemented. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Moving to Second Row:**
   - The program checks if the robot can move to the second row based on the current column's arrow direction and the next column's arrow direction.
   - However, the logic does not correctly handle scenarios where the robot needs to move back to the first row before reaching the last column of the second row.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not properly account for cases where the robot might need to backtrack or follow a path that involves moving between rows multiple times.

To fix this, we need a more robust approach to simulate the robot's movement through the grid and check if it can reach the target cell (2, n).

Here's a revised version of the solution:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    test_cases = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        row1 = input().strip()
        row2 = input().strip()
        test_cases.append((n, (row1, row2)))
    results = func_1(t, test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for test_case in test_cases:
        (n, (row1, row2)) = test_case
        position = 0
        row = 1
        while position < n and row <= 2:
            if row == 1:
                if row1[position] == '>':
                    position += 1
                else:
                    row = 2
            elif row == 2:
                if row2[position] == '>':
                    position += 1
                else:
                    row = 1
        if row == 2 and position == n - 1:
            results.append('YES')
        else:
            results.append('NO')
    return results
```

### Explanation of the Revised Solution:
- **Position Tracking:** We use `position` to track the current column index and `row` to track the current row (1 or 2).
- **Movement Simulation:** We simulate the robot's movement by checking the direction of the arrow at the current position and updating the position and row accordingly.
- **Target Check:** If the robot reaches the last column of the second row, we mark it as successful.

This approach ensures that the robot's movement is accurately simulated and the correct result is determined.
