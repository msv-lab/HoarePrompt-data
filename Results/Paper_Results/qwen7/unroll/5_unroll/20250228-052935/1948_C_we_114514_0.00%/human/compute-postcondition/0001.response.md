State: **`results` is an empty list, `test_cases` is a non-empty list**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `test_case`, which is being iterated over from `test_cases`.
2. For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The initial state of `results` as an empty list does not affect whether the loop will execute or not, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. The variable `test_case` is initialized within the loop and takes on each element of `test_cases` in sequence, so its initial value does not matter for the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is that `test_cases` must be a non-empty list.
