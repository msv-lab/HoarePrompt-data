Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and `test_cases`, a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (even and between 2 and 2â‹…10^5) and two strings of length `n` representing arrows in the first and second rows of a grid. The function checks, for each test case, whether the second row becomes reachable under the given conditions and returns a list named 'results' containing either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating the reachability of the second row.**
