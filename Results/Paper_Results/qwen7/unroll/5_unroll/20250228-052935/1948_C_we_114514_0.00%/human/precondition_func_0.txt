t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, test_cases[i] contains three lines: the first line is an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even; the second and third lines are strings of length n consisting of characters '<' and/or '>', representing the arrows in the first and second rows of the grid, respectively.
