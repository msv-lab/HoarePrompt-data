Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The function `func_1` iterates through each column of the grid and updates the reachability of the second row based on the arrows in both rows.
- The logic for updating `reachable_first_row` and `reachable_second_row` seems correct:
  - If the arrow in the first row is `>` and the robot is at the last column, the second row becomes reachable.
  - If the arrow in the first row is `<`, the robot cannot stay in the first row and must move to the second row if the next arrow in the second row is `>`.
  - The same logic applies to the second row.
- The final output is correct, as it appends `'YES'` or `'NO'` to the results list based on whether the second row becomes reachable.

Given the logic and the state information provided, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
