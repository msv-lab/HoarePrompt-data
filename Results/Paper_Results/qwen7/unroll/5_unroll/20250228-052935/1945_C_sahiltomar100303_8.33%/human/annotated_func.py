    #State: The value of `left` or `right` that minimizes the absolute difference with \((n + 1) / 2\), with ties broken by choosing the smallest index. If no such position can balance the number of zeros and ones, the output is the index that results in a balanced state closest to the center.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the positions in the string that minimize the absolute difference between the number of zeros and ones on either side of the position. If no such position exists, it returns the index that results in a balanced state closest to the center. The function implicitly returns the index that best balances the zeros and ones for each test case.
