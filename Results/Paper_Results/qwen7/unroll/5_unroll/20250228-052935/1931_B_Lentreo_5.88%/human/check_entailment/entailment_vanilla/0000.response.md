### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index is always less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key observation here is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This means that if we can distribute the water equally among all containers, each container should end up with `total_water / n` units of water.

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water units `nums`.
   - It calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each element in `nums`, accumulating these differences in `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Given Solution**:
   - The logic in the given solution is flawed. It does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed.
   - Specifically, the code sums the differences between each element and the last element, which does not reflect the actual distribution of water.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the average water per container and check if redistributing the water according to the given operation can achieve this uniform distribution.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the average water per container, which is `total_water / n`.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has exactly this average amount.

### Conclusion:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly check if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
