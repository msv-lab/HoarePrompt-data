### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the original assessment step-by-step.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code explains that the program processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t`, followed by an integer `n` and a list of `n` non-negative integers. It calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between consecutive non-zero numbers in the list. If this cumulative sum is zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Original Assessment:
- **Correctness:** False
- **Explanation:** The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. The logic in the program checks if the difference between the last element and each other element sums to zero, which is not a valid approach.

#### Corrected Version:
The original assessment suggests a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if all containers can reach the average amount of water
        if all(a == avg_water for a in nums):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Original Program Logic:**
   - The original program calculates the difference between each element and the last element in the list.
   - It then checks if the cumulative sum of these differences is zero.
   - This approach is flawed because it does not ensure that the containers can be made equal. It only checks if the differences between consecutive elements sum to zero, which is not sufficient.

2. **Corrected Program Logic:**
   - The corrected program calculates the average amount of water per container.
   - It then checks if all containers can reach this average amount of water.
   - This approach is correct because if all containers can reach the average, it means that the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

3. **Example Test Case:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     5
     4 5 2 1 3
     ```
   - The original program would calculate the differences and check if they sum to zero, which they do not.
   - The corrected program would calculate the average (which is 3) and check if all containers can reach this average, which they can.

#### Conclusion:
The original program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the containers can be made equal. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is indeed correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect, and the original assessment was accurate.
