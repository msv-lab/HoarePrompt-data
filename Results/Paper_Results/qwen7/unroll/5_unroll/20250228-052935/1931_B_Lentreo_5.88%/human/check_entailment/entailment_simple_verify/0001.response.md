### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another, where the source container index is always less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key observation here is that the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). This means that if we can distribute the water equally among all containers, each container should end up with `total_water / n` units of water.

3. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water units `nums`.
   - It calculates the difference between the last element (`last`) and each element in `nums`, accumulating these differences in `curr`.
   - If `curr` is zero, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. **Flaw in the Given Solution**:
   - The logic in the given solution is flawed. It does not correctly check if the water can be evenly distributed.
   - Specifically, the code sums the differences between each element and the last element, which does not reflect the actual distribution of water.
   - The correct approach would be to calculate the average water per container, which is `total_water / n`, and check if redistributing the water according to the given operation can achieve this uniform distribution.

5. **Correct Approach**:
   - Calculate the average water per container, which is `total_water / n`.
   - Check if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has exactly this average amount.

6. **Annotated Code Evaluation**:
   - The annotated code states that the output is 'YES' if the cumulative sum of non-zero differences between consecutive numbers in the list is zero, otherwise 'NO'.
   - This is a misinterpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation should be checking if the total water can be evenly divided among the containers.

7. **Correct Solution**:
   - Calculate the total water `total_water` by summing all elements in `nums`.
   - Calculate the average water per container `avg_water` as `total_water // n`.
   - Check if `total_water % n == 0` (which is already guaranteed by the problem statement).
   - Verify if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has `avg_water` units. This can be done by ensuring that the sum of the differences between each element and `avg_water` is zero.

8. **Conclusion**:
   - The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly check if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
   - The correct solution involves calculating the average and verifying the redistribution.

### Conclusion:

The given solution is incorrect because it does not properly check if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**

Final: **False**
