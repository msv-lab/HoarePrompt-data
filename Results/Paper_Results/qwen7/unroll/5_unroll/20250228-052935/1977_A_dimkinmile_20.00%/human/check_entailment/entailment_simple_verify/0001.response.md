### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` using `int(input())`.
2. **Loop for Test Cases**: It then iterates over each test case using a loop that runs `kreker` times.
3. **Function Call**: Inside the loop, it calls the function `func_1()`. However, the function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments but expects two integers `n` and `m` when called inside the loop. This mismatch will cause an error because the function does not accept any arguments.
4. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments (`def func_1():`) but attempts to read `n` and `m` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is incorrect.
5. **Condition Check**: If the condition `n >= m` is met, it prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No". This logic is correct according to the problem statement.

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: `kreker` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- **Loop Iteration**: For each test case, the program calls `func_1()`, but `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments.
- **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments, but it tries to read `n` and `m` from the input. This is incorrect.
- **Condition Check**: The logic inside `func_1()` checks if `n >= m` and prints "Yes" or "No" accordingly. This logic is correct.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct in identifying the mismatch between the function definition and its call. However, the original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program is incorrect due to this mismatch. The program would indeed fail due to the mismatch, but the logic within the function itself is correct.

Given the annotated code and the problem description, the function should be defined to accept arguments `n` and `m`. However, the provided program does not match this requirement, leading to a runtime error.

### Corrected Program:
```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    def func_1(n, m):
        if n >= m:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
    func_1(n, m)
```

### Final Evaluation:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because the function `func_1()` is defined to take no arguments but is called with arguments `n` and `m`.
