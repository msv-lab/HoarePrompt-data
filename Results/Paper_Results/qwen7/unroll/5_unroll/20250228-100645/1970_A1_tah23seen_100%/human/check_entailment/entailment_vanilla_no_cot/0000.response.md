Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the balanced shuffle operation as described. Specifically, the solution sorts the keys of the dictionary `d` instead of sorting the positions based on the computed balances. Here's the correct implementation:

```python
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    # Create a list of tuples (balance, position, original index)
    balance_positions = [(bal, pos, orig) for orig, (pos, bal) in enumerate(d.items())]
    # Sort the list by balance (ascending) and then by position (descending)
    balance_positions.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))
    # Extract the original indices and construct the result string
    for _, _, orig in balance_positions:
        ans += s[orig]
    return ans
```

This corrected version constructs the list of tuples with the necessary information and sorts them properly according to the problem statement.
