You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A parentheses sequence is a string consisting of characters "(" and ")", for
example "(()((".

A balanced parentheses sequence is a parentheses sequence which can become a
valid mathematical expression after inserting numbers and operations into it,
for example "(()(()))".

The balance of a parentheses sequence is defined as the number of opening
parentheses "(" minus the number of closing parentheses ")". For example, the
balance of the sequence "(()((" is 3.

A balanced parentheses sequence can also be defined as a parentheses sequence
with balance 0 such that each of its prefixes has a non-negative balance.

We define the balanced shuffle operation that takes a parentheses sequence and
returns a parentheses sequence as follows: first, for every character of the
input sequence, we compute the balance of the prefix of the sequence before
that character and write those down in a table together with the positions of
the characters in the input sequence, for example:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 2| 1| 2| 3| 2| 1  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 2| 3| 4| 5| 6| 7| 8  
Character| (| (| )| (| (| )| )| )  
  
Then, we sort the columns of this table in increasing order of prefix balance,
breaking ties in decreasing order of position. In the above example, we get:

Prefix balance| 0| 1| 1| 1| 2| 2| 2| 3  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Position| 1| 8| 4| 2| 7| 5| 3| 6  
Character| (| )| (| (| )| (| )| )  
  
The last row of this table forms another parentheses sequence, in this case
"()(()())". This sequence is called the result of applying the balanced
shuffle operation to the input sequence, or in short just the balanced shuffle
of the input sequence.

You are given a balanced parentheses sequence. Print its balanced shuffle.

Input

The only line of input contains a string s consisting only of characters "("
and ")". This string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses
sequence with its length not exceeding 500\,000 .

Output

Print the parentheses sequence t — the balanced shuffle of s .

Example

Input

    (()(()))
    
Output

    ()(()())

- Program: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
    return ans



- Annotated Code: 
n = input()
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")". The string is guaranteed to be a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with its length not exceeding 500,000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    ans = ''
    d = {}
    d[0] = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '(':
            d[i + 1] = d[i] + 1
        else:
            d[i + 1] = d[i] - 1
        
    #State: Output State: `s` is a string consisting only of characters "(" and ")"; `n` is the length of the string `s`; `ans` is an empty string; `d` is a list where each element represents the balance of "(" and ")" up to that index in `s`.
    d.pop(n)
    d = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda x: (x[1], -x[0]))
    for (i, j) in d:
        ans += s[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `ans` is a string containing all characters from `s` at the indices specified in the list `d`, in the order given by `d`.
    return ans
    #The program returns a string containing characters from `s` at the indices specified in the list `d`, in the order given by `d`.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Function Call**:
   - The program reads a string `s` from the input.
   - It calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input.
   - It calculates the balance of the prefix up to each position in the string and stores these values in a dictionary `d`.
   - The balance is updated for each character in the string: 
     - If the character is '(', the balance increases by 1.
     - If the character is ')', the balance decreases by 1.
   - After calculating the balances, the dictionary `d` is sorted based on the balance values (ascending) and positions (descending).
   - Finally, the function constructs the resulting balanced shuffle sequence by concatenating the characters at the sorted positions.

### Detailed Check

1. **Balance Calculation**:
   - The balance calculation part seems correct. The dictionary `d` correctly stores the balance at each position.

2. **Sorting Logic**:
   - The sorting logic sorts the keys of the dictionary based on the balance values in ascending order and positions in descending order.
   - This ensures that the sequence is constructed according to the rules of the balanced shuffle operation.

3. **Result Construction**:
   - The construction of the result sequence by iterating over the sorted keys and appending the corresponding characters from the original string is correct.

### Example Walkthrough

Given the input `(()(()))`:
- Balance calculations:
  - Prefix balance | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3
  - Position       | 1 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 7 | 5 | 3 | 6
  - Character      | ( | ) | ( | ( | ) | ( | ) | )
- Sorted dictionary:
  - Key | Value
  - 1   | (   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 8   | )   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 4   | (   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 2   | (   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 7   | )   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 5   | (   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 3   | (   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
  - 6   | )   (   (   (   )   )   )   )
- Result sequence: `()(()())`
