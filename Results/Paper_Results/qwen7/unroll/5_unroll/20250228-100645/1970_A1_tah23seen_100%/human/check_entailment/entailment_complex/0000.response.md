Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. The function `func_1` first computes the balance of the parentheses sequence at each position.
3. It then sorts these balances along with their corresponding positions, ensuring that ties in balance are broken by higher positions.
4. Finally, it constructs a new string using the characters from the original sequence at the sorted indices, which matches the definition of the balanced shuffle operation.

Given the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` performs the required operations accurately.

Correctness: **True**
