Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - `T` is read as the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `S` (which is actually `N`, the size of the array) is read.
   - The array `N` is then split and converted into a list of integers.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - The array `N` is sorted. This is unnecessary for solving the problem since the order of elements does not affect the MEX calculation directly.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `cur` is initialized to `-1`.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to keep track of the count of each number in the sorted array.

4. **Populating the Dictionary:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`:
     - If `num` is greater than `cur + 1`, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it sets `cur` to `num` and increments its count in `M`.
   - If the current number `num` is not greater than `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in `M`.

5. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It then iterates from 0 to `cur` and checks if the count of `i` in `M` is less than or equal to `i`. If so, it sets `cur` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.

6. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints `cur`.

### Correctness Analysis

The program aims to simulate the game and calculate the MEX of the resulting array `c`. However, there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Logic for MEX Calculation:**
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the sorted array can be used to determine the MEX. The MEX is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the array `c`, not just the smallest number in the sorted array.
   - The program only considers the counts of numbers and does not ensure that the MEX is correctly determined.

2. **Unnecessary Sorting:**
   - Sorting the array `N` is unnecessary and can be omitted without affecting the correctness of the solution.

3. **Incorrect Handling of Counts:**
   - The program does not correctly handle the counts to ensure that the MEX is calculated properly. It only checks if the count of a number is less than or equal to the number itself, which is not sufficient to determine the MEX.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
