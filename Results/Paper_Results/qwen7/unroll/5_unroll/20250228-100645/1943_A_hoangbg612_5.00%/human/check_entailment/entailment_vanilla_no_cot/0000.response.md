Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Turns**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as described in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array `N` and tries to determine the MEX directly from the sorted array without considering the alternating turns of Alice and Bob.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**: The logic to calculate the MEX is flawed. It assumes that the sorted array can directly give the MEX, which is not true for the game described. The game involves strategic choices by both players, and the sorted array does not capture the optimal play.

3. **Missing Optimal Strategy**: The solution does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Alice wants to maximize the MEX, and Bob wants to minimize it. The current implementation does not simulate these strategies.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game where Alice and Bob take turns optimally. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the array to understand the sequence of numbers.
2. **Simulate Turns**: Simulate the turns of Alice and Bob, ensuring that Alice always picks the smallest available number and Bob picks the next smallest available number.
3. **Determine MEX**: After simulating the game, determine the MEX of the resulting array `c`.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        N.sort()

        # Initialize the result array c
        c = []

        # Alice's turn
        for i in range(0, len(N), 2):
            c.append(N[i])

        # Bob's turn
        for i in range(1, len(N), 2):
            c.append(N[i])

        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1

        print(mex)

# Call the function
func()
```

This approach ensures that the game is simulated according to the rules and calculates the MEX correctly.
