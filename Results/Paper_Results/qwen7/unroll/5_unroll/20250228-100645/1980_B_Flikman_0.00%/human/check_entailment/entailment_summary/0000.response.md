Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Dmitry's favorite cube will be removed after sorting and removing the first `k` cubes. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `f`, and `k` along with the list `a`.

2. **Identifying Favorite Value**: It identifies the favorite value by accessing `a[f - 1]`.

3. **Counting Values**:
   - It counts how many elements in the list are equal to the favorite value (`same_value_count`).
   - It counts how many elements are greater than the favorite value (`greater_count`).

4. **Determining Removal**:
   - If there are at least `k` elements greater than the favorite value, the favorite cube will definitely be removed, so it prints 'YES'.
   - If the sum of elements greater than and equal to the favorite value is less than or equal to `k`, the favorite cube will definitely not be removed, so it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the outcome is uncertain, so it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented in the code, the program correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
