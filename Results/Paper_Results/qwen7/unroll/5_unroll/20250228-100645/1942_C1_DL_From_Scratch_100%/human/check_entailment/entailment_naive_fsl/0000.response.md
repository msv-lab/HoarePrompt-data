Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly solve the problem. Specifically, the program fails to account for the possibility of forming additional triangles using the remaining vertices after considering the initial segments defined by the chosen vertices. 

Consider the following test case:
```
4 2 0
1 3
```
The program will output `2`, assuming that only the two triangles formed by the vertices 1 and 3 can be counted. However, in a quadrilateral (n=4), any two non-adjacent vertices can form a diagonal, thus creating two triangles. Therefore, the correct output should be `2` triangles, but the program does not consider the full potential of forming triangles within the polygon.

To fix this, the program needs to calculate the number of triangles that can be formed by considering all possible non-intersecting diagonals, not just the segments between the chosen vertices. This involves a more complex algorithm to ensure all possible triangles are counted.
