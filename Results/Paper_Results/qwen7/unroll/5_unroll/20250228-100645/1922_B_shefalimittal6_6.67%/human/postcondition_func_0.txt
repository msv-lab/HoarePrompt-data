The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, a positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of non-negative integers. For each test case, it calculates a result based on the frequency of integers in the list `a`. Specifically, it counts the number of ways to choose 3 or 2 integers from each frequency group and sums these values to produce the final result for each test case. The function then prints the result for each test case.
