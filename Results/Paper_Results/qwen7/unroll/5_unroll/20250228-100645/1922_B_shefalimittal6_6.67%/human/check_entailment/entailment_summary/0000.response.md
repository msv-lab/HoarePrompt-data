Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by counting the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Frequency Counting**: It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count the frequency of each integer in the list `nums`.
3. **Triangle Formation Conditions**:
   - To form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side.
   - The program checks for combinations where at least one type of stick has a frequency of 3 or more, and calculates the number of ways to choose 3 such sticks using `math.comb(cnt, 3)`.
   - For frequencies of 2 or more, it calculates the number of ways to choose 2 such sticks and multiplies by the total number of other sticks (`total_sum`), ensuring the triangle inequality condition is met.
4. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case.

However, there are some issues with the logic:
- The program does not properly check the triangle inequality conditions for the combinations of sticks.
- The approach of simply counting combinations without verifying the triangle inequality might lead to incorrect results.

Given the execution summary, the program seems to be attempting to count combinations but fails to ensure that the chosen sticks can actually form a triangle. Therefore, the program is likely incorrect because it does not validate the triangle inequality conditions.

Correctness: **False**
