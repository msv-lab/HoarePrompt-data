### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the solution.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The robot starts at (1, 1).
2. The robot moves according to the arrow in the current cell.
3. The robot can move left, right, up, or down, but cannot leave the grid.
4. The goal is to determine if the robot can reach (2, n).

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Initialization**:
   ```python
   reachable_first_row = True
   reachable_second_row = False
   ```
   These variables are used to track whether the robot can stay in the first or second row, respectively.

2. **Loop through each column**:
   ```python
   for j in range(n):
       if reachable_first_row:
           if row1[j] == '>':
               if j == n - 1:
                   reachable_second_row = True
           else:
               reachable_first_row = False
               if j < n - 1 and row2[j] == '>':
                   reachable_second_row = True
       if reachable_second_row:
           if row2[j] == '>':
               if j == n - 1:
                   reachable_second_row = True
   ```

3. **Logic Explanation**:
   - The variable `reachable_first_row` is set to `True` initially.
   - If the robot is in the first row and the arrow points right (`>`), it moves to the next column. If it reaches the last column, `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
   - If the arrow in the first row points left (`<`), `reachable_first_row` is set to `False`, and the program checks if the next column in the second row has an arrow pointing right (`>`). If so, `reachable_second_row` is set to `True`.
   - If the robot is in the second row and the arrow points right (`>`), it moves to the next column. If it reaches the last column, `reachable_second_row` remains `True`.

4. **Final Check**:
   ```python
   if reachable_second_row:
       results.append('YES')
   else:
       results.append('NO')
   ```

#### Detailed Analysis:
- **Case 1: All Arrows Point Right in Both Rows**
  - If both rows have all arrows pointing right, the robot can always move right until it reaches (2, n).
  - Example: `>>>...>>` in both rows.
  
- **Case 2: Mixed Arrows with Transitions**
  - If there are mixed arrows, the program correctly handles transitions between rows.
  - Example: `>><<...><>` in the first row and `>>><...><>` in the second row.
  
- **Case 3: Invalid Transitions**
  - The program correctly identifies invalid transitions where the robot cannot reach (2, n).
  - Example: `><><...><>` in the first row and `><><...><>` in the second row.

#### Edge Cases:
- **All Left Arrows in First Row and All Right Arrows in Second Row**
  - The program correctly identifies that the robot can reach (2, n).
  - Example: `<><...><` in the first row and `>>><...><` in the second row.

- **All Right Arrows in First Row and All Left Arrows in Second Row**
  - The program correctly identifies that the robot cannot reach (2, n).
  - Example: `>>><...><` in the first row and `<><...><` in the second row.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly handles all potential cases and accurately determines whether the robot can reach (2, n). The logic is comprehensive and accounts for all possible movements and transitions between rows.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The provided program is correct and accurately solves the problem as described.
