#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and n is even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of the grid, where each string consists of exactly n characters that are either '<' or '>'; the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2⋅10^5.
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []

    #State: Output State: `results` is a list containing strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met within each iteration of the loop. The specific content of `results` depends on the values of `test_cases`, but it will consist of either 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case evaluated.
    return results
    #The program returns a list named 'results' containing strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met within each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (even and between 2 and 2⋅10^5), and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. The function evaluates whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row by following '>' characters. For each test case, it appends 'YES' to the results list if the movement is possible, otherwise 'NO'. Finally, it returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings based on the evaluation.
