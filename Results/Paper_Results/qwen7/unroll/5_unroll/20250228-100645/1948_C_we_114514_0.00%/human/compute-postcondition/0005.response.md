Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4, and a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of lists. Each inner list contains three elements: an integer `n` (between 2 and 2â‹…10^5, inclusive, and even), and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid, where each string consists of exactly `n` characters that are either '<' or '>'. The function returns a list named 'results' containing strings 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions met within each iteration of the loop.**
