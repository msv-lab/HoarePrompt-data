Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Test Case Collection:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `n` and the two rows of arrows.
   - This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases.
   - For each test case, it checks if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

3. **Logic Inside `func_1`:**
   - It initializes `reachable_first_row` to `True` and `reachable_second_row` to `False`.
   - It iterates through each column `j` of the grid.
     - If the robot is still in the first row (`reachable_first_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow.
       - If the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if the robot has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.
       - If the arrow points left (`<`), it moves to the second row but only if the next column in the second row points right (`>`).
     - If the robot is in the second row (`reachable_second_row` is `True`), it checks the direction of the arrow.
       - If the arrow points right (`>`), it checks if the robot has reached the last column. If so, it sets `reachable_second_row` to `True`.

4. **Final Result:**
   - After checking all columns, if `reachable_second_row` is `True`, it appends 'YES' to the results.
   - Otherwise, it appends 'NO'.

### Verification with Examples

Let's verify the logic with the provided examples:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `row1 = ">><< "`, `row2 = ">>><"`
   - The robot can reach `(2, 4)` via path: `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 2) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 2`, `row1 = ">< "`, `row2 = "><"`
   - The robot can reach `(2, 2)` via path: `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 4`, `row1 = ">>>< "`, `row2 = ">><<"`
   - The robot cannot reach `(2, 4)` because it gets stuck at `(2, 3)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `NO`.

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `4`
   - Test Case 1: `n = 6`, `row1 = ">><<>< "`, `row2 = "><>>><"`
   - The robot can reach `(2, 6)` via path: `(1, 1) -> (2, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 3) -> (2, 3) -> (2, 4) -> (2, 5) -> (2, 6)`.
   - The program correctly outputs `YES`.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the program and verifying it against the provided examples, we can conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.

**Correctness: **True**
