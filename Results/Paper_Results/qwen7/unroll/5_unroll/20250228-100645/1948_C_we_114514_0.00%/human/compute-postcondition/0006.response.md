Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case includes an integer `n` (even and between 2 and 2â‹…10^5), and two strings representing the first and second rows of a grid. The function evaluates whether it is possible to move from the first row to the second row by following '>' characters. For each test case, it appends 'YES' to the results list if the movement is possible, otherwise 'NO'. Finally, it returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' strings based on the evaluation.**
