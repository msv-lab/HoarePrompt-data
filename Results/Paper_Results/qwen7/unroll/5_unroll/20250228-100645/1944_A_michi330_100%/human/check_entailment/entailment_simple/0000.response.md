Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading `n` and `k` for each case.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`:
   - If `k >= n - 1`, it prints `1`. This is correct because if Dominater can destroy at least `n - 1` bridges, he can disconnect island 1 from all other islands.
   - If `k < n - 1`, it prints `n`. This is also correct because if `k` is less than `n - 1`, Everule can still reach all islands through alternative routes.
4. The constraints and examples provided in the problem statement match the logic implemented in the program.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
