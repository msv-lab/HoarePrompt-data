Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes inputs t, n, and k where t is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, and for each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and k.**

This means the function is designed to take in a series of test cases defined by the parameters t, n, and k, and for each case, it checks the relationship between n and k to determine the output.
