Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \). If \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n - 1 \), it prints '1'; otherwise, it prints \( n \). The function outputs a line for each test case, resulting in a total of \( t \) lines of output, where \( t \) is the number of test cases.**
