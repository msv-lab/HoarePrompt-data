Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \leq y < x \)) such that \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
- The function `func_1` is supposed to find such a \( y \).
- However, the implementation of `func_1` has a flaw. Specifically, the function always returns 1, regardless of the value of \( x \). This is because the loop condition starts from \( x - 1 \) down to 2, and the first check `if x % y == 0:` will never be true for \( y = x - 1 \) since \( x \) and \( x - 1 \) are coprime (i.e., their GCD is 1). Therefore, the function immediately returns 1 without checking any other values of \( y \).

Given the example inputs and outputs, the function's behavior does not match the expected requirements. For instance, when \( x = 10 \), the correct \( y \) should be 5 (since \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 10 \)), but the function returns 1.

Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
