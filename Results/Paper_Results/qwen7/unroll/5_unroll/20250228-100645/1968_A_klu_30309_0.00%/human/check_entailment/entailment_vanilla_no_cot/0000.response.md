Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly maximize the value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\). The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it prematurely returns the first \(y\) that meets the condition \(2 * y \geq x\), without checking all possible values of \(y\) to ensure the maximum value is found.

To fix this, we need to iterate through all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\) and keep track of the maximum value of \(\gcd(x, y) + y\).

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        x = int(input())
        y = func_1(x)
        print(y)

def func_1(x):
    """Finds the y that maximizes gcd(x, y) + y.

    Args:
        x: The given integer.

    Returns:
        The optimal y.
    """
    max_val = 0
    for y in range(1, x):
        current_val = gcd(x, y) + y
        if current_val > max_val:
            max_val = current_val
            best_y = y
    return best_y
```

In this corrected version, we initialize `max_val` to 0 and iterate through all possible values of \(y\) from 1 to \(x-1\). We calculate \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for each \(y\) and update `max_val` and `best_y` if the current value is greater than the previous maximum. Finally, we return the value of `best_y`.
