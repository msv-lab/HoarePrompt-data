You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `x`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the integer `y` such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - It iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to `2` (since `y` must be less than `x`).
   - For each `y`, it checks if `x % y == 0` (i.e., `y` is a divisor of `x`).
   - If `y` is a divisor of `x` and \(2 \cdot y \geq x\), it returns `y` immediately because this condition ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.
   - If no such `y` is found (which theoretically shouldn't happen given the constraints), it returns the last valid `y` found (`max_val`).

3. **Output Handling:**
   - The program prints the result of `func_1(x)` for each test case.

### Verification of Correctness:

- **Edge Cases:**
  - For `x = 2`, the only possible `y` is `1`. Since \(2 \cdot 1 < 2\), the function should return `1`.
  - For `x = 3`, the possible `y` values are `1` and `2`. Since \(2 \cdot 2 \geq 3\), the function should return `2`.
  - For larger values of `x`, the function correctly identifies the largest `y` that divides `x` and satisfies \(2 \cdot y \geq x\).

- **General Case:**
  - The function iterates backwards from `x-1` to `2`, ensuring it finds the largest possible `y` that meets the criteria.
  - The check `2 * y >= x` ensures that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the integer `y` that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
