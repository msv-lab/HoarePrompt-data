Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find an integer \( y \) (where \( 1 \le y < x \)) such that \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) is maximized. The provided solution iterates from \( x-1 \) down to 2 to find the largest \( y \) that divides \( x \) and satisfies \( 2y \ge x \).

2. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the largest \( y \) that meets the criteria.
   - It starts from \( x-1 \) and decrements until it finds a divisor of \( x \).
   - If a divisor \( y \) is found where \( 2y \ge x \), it returns \( y \).
   - Otherwise, it returns the last found \( y \) (which is the largest divisor of \( x \) less than \( x \)).

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - For \( x = 2 \), the only possible \( y \) is 1, and \( 2 \cdot 1 = 2 \ge 2 \) holds true.
   - For other values of \( x \), the function correctly identifies the largest \( y \) that satisfies the condition.

4. **Verification with Provided Example**:
   - For \( x = 10 \): The divisors are 1, 2, 5, and 10. The largest \( y \) satisfying \( 2y \ge 10 \) is 5.
   - For \( x = 7 \): The divisors are 1, 7. The largest \( y \) satisfying \( 2y \ge 7 \) is 7/2 rounded down, which is 3, but since 3 is not a divisor, it returns 1.
   - For \( x = 21 \): The divisors are 1, 3, 7, 21. The largest \( y \) satisfying \( 2y \ge 21 \) is 10.5, so the largest integer \( y \) is 10, but since 10 is not a divisor, it returns 7.
   - For \( x = 100 \): The largest \( y \) satisfying \( 2y \ge 100 \) is 50, but since 50 is not a divisor, it returns 50.
   - For \( x = 2 \): The only \( y \) is 1.
   - For \( x = 1000 \): The largest \( y \) satisfying \( 2y \ge 1000 \) is 500, but since 500 is not a divisor, it returns 500.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The function logic correctly identifies the largest \( y \) that maximizes \(\gcd(x, y) + y\) within the constraints provided.
