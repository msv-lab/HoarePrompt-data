Output State: **The function is defined but no value is returned or assigned to a variable. The variable `x` remains an integer such that 2 <= x <= 1000.**

The provided code snippet is a docstring for a function that aims to find the value of `y` that maximizes `gcd(x, y) + y`. However, the actual implementation of the function body is missing. Therefore, after the code is executed, the function is defined but no value is returned or assigned to a variable. The variable `x` retains its initial state as an integer within the range 2 to 1000.
