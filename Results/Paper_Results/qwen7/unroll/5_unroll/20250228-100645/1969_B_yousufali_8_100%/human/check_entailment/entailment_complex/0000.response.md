Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires finding the minimum total cost to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Each cyclic shift operation has a cost equal to the length of the substring chosen for the shift.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads a binary string `s`, counts the number of occurrences of '0' in the string, and for each '0', it adds the count of consecutive '1's before it plus one to a total sum. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.
   - **func_2()**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1()`. However, `func_1()` does not correctly calculate the minimum cost to sort the string using cyclic shifts.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve the problem correctly, we need to identify the positions of '0's and '1's and calculate the minimum cost to move all '0's to the front of the string using cyclic shifts.
   - The correct approach would involve identifying the longest prefix of '1's and then calculating the cost to move the remaining '0's to the beginning.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided functions do not correctly implement the solution to the problem. `func_1()` does not compute the minimum cost to sort the string, and `func_2()` simply calls `func_1()` without addressing the actual problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
