You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's define a cyclic shift of some string s as a transformation from s_1 s_2
\dots s_{n-1} s_{n} into s_{n} s_1 s_2 \dots s_{n-1} . In other words, you
take one last character s_n and place it before the first character while
moving all other characters to the right.

You are given a binary string s (a string consisting of only 0-s and/or 1-s).

In one operation, you can choose any substring s_l s_{l+1} \dots s_r (1 \le l
< r \le |s| ) and cyclically shift it. The cost of such operation is equal to
r - l + 1 (or the length of the chosen substring).

You can perform the given operation any number of times. What is the minimum
total cost to make s sorted in non-descending order?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains a binary string s (2 \le
|s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ; s_i \in {0, 1}) — the string you need to sort.

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of lengths of strings over all
test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum total cost to make
string sorted using operation above any number of times.

Example

Input

    5
    
    10
    
    0000
    
    11000
    
    101011
    
    01101001

Output

    2
    0
    9
    5
    11
    
Note

In the first test case, you can choose the whole string and perform a cyclic
shift: 10 \rightarrow 01. The length of the substring is 2 , so the cost is 2
.

In the second test case, the string is already sorted, so you don't need to
perform any operations.

In the third test case, one of the optimal strategies is the next:

  1. choose substring [1, 3] : 11000 \rightarrow 01100; 
  2. choose substring [2, 4] : 01100 \rightarrow 00110; 
  3. choose substring [3, 5] : 00110 \rightarrow 00011. 

The total cost is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    s = input()
    n = 0
    ans = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == '1':
            n += 1
        if s[i] == '0' and n != 0:
            ans += n + 1
    print(ans)

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes a binary string `s` and determines whether `s` can be sorted in non-descending order through cyclic shifts, returning a result for each test case.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order.
   - A cyclic shift operation on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) costs \( r - l + 1 \).
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is flawed because:
     - It only counts the number of '1's consecutively and adds `n + 1` when encountering a '0'.
     - This approach does not account for the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
     - For example, consider the string "101011". The function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 (1+1+1+1+1), but the correct cost is 9.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "101011":
     - The function would count three '1's and add 4 (3+1) for the first '0', then reset `n`.
     - It would again count two '1's and add 3 (2+1) for the second '0', then reset `n`.
     - Finally, it would count one '1' and add 2 (1+1) for the last '0'.
     - Total cost: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 (incorrect).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where we need to perform cyclic shifts.
   - We should track the indices of '0's and '1's and calculate the minimum cost to move all '0's to the beginning and '1's to the end.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The given function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.
   - Therefore, the program is incorrect.
