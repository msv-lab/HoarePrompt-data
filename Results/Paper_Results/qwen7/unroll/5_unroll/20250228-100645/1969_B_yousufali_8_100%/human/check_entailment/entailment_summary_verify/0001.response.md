### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to sort a binary string in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
   - The cost of a cyclic shift on a substring of length \( r - l + 1 \) is \( r - l + 1 \).
   - The goal is to find the minimum total cost to achieve a sorted string.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` as input.
   - It initializes `n` to count consecutive '1's and `ans` to accumulate the cost.
   - For each character in the string:
     - If the character is '1', it increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not zero, it adds `n + 1` to `ans` and resets `n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is indeed flawed because:
     - It only counts the number of '1's consecutively and adds `n + 1` when encountering a '0'.
     - This approach does not account for the actual cyclic shifts needed to sort the string.
     - For example, consider the string "101011". The function would incorrectly calculate the cost as 5 (1+1+1+1+1), but the correct cost is 9.

4. **Example Analysis:**
   - For the string "101011":
     - The function would count three '1's and add 4 (3+1) for the first '0', then reset `n`.
     - It would again count two '1's and add 3 (2+1) for the second '0', then reset `n`.
     - Finally, it would count one '1' and add 2 (1+1) for the last '0'.
     - Total cost: 4 + 3 + 2 = 9 (incorrect).

5. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly solve this problem, we need to identify the positions where we need to perform cyclic shifts.
   - We should track the indices of '0's and '1's and calculate the minimum cost to move all '0's to the beginning and '1's to the end.
   - Specifically, for each '0' at index `i`, we need to count the number of '1's that come after it until the next '0' or the end of the string. The cost for each '0' is the distance to the nearest '1' plus the length of the substring between them.

6. **Function Summary:**
   - The function summary for `func_2` indicates that it processes multiple test cases, but it does not specify how it calculates the minimum cost.
   - Given the flaw in `func_1`, the overall program is still incorrect unless there is a different and correct implementation within `func_2` which is not provided in the given code.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.
- Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
