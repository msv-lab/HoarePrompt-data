### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make a binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. A cyclic shift of a substring from index `l` to `r` costs `r - l + 1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`:**
   - Reads a binary string `s`.
   - Initializes `n` to 0 and `ans` to 0.
   - Iterates through each character in `s`.
     - If the character is '1', increments `n`.
     - If the character is '0' and `n` is not 0, adds `n + 1` to `ans`.
   - Prints `ans`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - Reads an integer `t`, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, calls `func_1`.

#### Annotations and State Analysis:
- **Initial State:** `s` is a binary string.
- **After `func_1`:** `ans` is the sum of `n + 1` for each occurrence of '0' in `s`, where `n` is the count of consecutive '1's before the '0'.
- **Initial State:** `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- **After `func_2`:** `t` test cases have been processed, but the specific actions within `func_1` are unknown.

#### Evaluation:
The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic:**
   - The program assumes that the cost of sorting the string is simply the sum of `n + 1` for each '0' in the string, where `n` is the count of consecutive '1's before the '0'. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the optimal strategy of performing cyclic shifts.
   - For example, consider the input "101011":
     - The program would calculate the cost as 5 (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1).
     - However, the optimal strategy involves multiple smaller shifts:
       1. Choose the substring [3, 5]: "101011" → "101101" (cost = 3)
       2. Choose the substring [4, 6]: "101101" → "101110" (cost = 2)
       3. Choose the substring [5, 6]: "101110" → "101110" (cost = 2)
     - The total cost would be 3 + 2 + 2 = 7, which is not calculated by the provided function.

2. **Example Test Case:**
   - Input: "101011"
   - Expected Output: 7
   - Actual Output: 5

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly calculate the minimum total cost to make the binary string sorted in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
