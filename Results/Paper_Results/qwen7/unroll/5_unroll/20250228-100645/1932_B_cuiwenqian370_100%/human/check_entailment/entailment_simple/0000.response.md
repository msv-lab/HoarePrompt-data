### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read`, splits the input into a list of strings, and processes it accordingly. This part handles multiple test cases efficiently.

2. **Test Case Loop**: For each test case, the program correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and their periodicities (`a`). It initializes `last_year` with the periodicity of the first sign.

3. **Year Calculation**: The program calculates the year when each subsequent sign will occur. It uses the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` to find the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one has occurred. This ensures that the signs occur sequentially.

4. **Output**: The program collects the results for each test case and writes them to the standard output in the required format.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the next year when each sign will occur is correct. The formula used ensures that the signs occur in the correct sequence.
- The program correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each one independently.
- The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
