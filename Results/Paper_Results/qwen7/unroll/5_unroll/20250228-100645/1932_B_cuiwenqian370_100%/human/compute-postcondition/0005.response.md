Output State: **`index` is 2, `T` is an integer from data at index 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing variables (`index`, `T`, `t`, `n`, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, `data`). Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
