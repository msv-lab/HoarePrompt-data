Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input using `input()`, which is replaced with `sys.stdin.read` in the initial state description. This line of input is then split into a list of strings using the `split()` method, and the resulting list is assigned to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and the sequence `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` remain unchanged.
