### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and compare it with the requirements and the function summary.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calculates a specific value for each test case.
- It correctly handles multiple test cases and processes each test case by reading the number of signs `n` and the periodicities `a`.
- The function then iterates through the periodicities to calculate the year in which the last sign will occur.
- The result for each test case is appended to a list, and finally, the results are written to standard output.

#### Program Analysis:
- The program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
- The key part of the program is the loop where it calculates the next year for each sign:
  ```python
  for i in range(1, n):
      next_year = (last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]
      last_year = next_year
  ```
- This loop iteratively updates `last_year` to the next occurrence of the sign after the previous one.
- The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` is intended to find the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

Let's verify the logic:
- For the first sign, `last_year` is initialized to `a[0]`.
- For the second sign, `next_year` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `a[1]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
- This process continues for all signs.

Given the example input:
```
6
3 2 4 5 9 18
```
- First sign: Year 3
- Second sign: Year 4 (since 3 + 1 = 4, and 4 is a multiple of 2)
- Third sign: Year 8 (since 4 + 1 = 5, and the smallest multiple of 4 that is >= 5 is 8)
- Fourth sign: Year 10 (since 8 + 1 = 9, and the smallest multiple of 5 that is >= 9 is 10)
- Fifth sign: Year 18 (since 10 + 1 = 11, and the smallest multiple of 9 that is >= 11 is 18)
- Sixth sign: Year 36 (since 18 + 1 = 19, and the smallest multiple of 18 that is >= 19 is 36)

This matches the expected output of 36.

#### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the year in which the last sign will occur, ensuring that each sign occurs strictly after the previous one. The original assessment was incorrect because the provided program does indeed meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
