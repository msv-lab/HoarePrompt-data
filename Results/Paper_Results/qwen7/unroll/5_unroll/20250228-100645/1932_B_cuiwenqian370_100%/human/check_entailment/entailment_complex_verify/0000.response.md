### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and the annotated version to understand its behavior and compare it with the expected solution.

#### Code Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the necessary information for each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.
   - It then iterates through the remaining periodicities, calculating the next year for each sign using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

3. **Formula Explanation:**
   - The formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]` simplifies to `((last_year + a[i]) // a[i]) * a[i]`.
   - This formula is intended to find the next multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.

#### Correctness Analysis:
- The formula used in the code is actually correct for finding the next multiple of `a[i]` that is strictly greater than `last_year`. This ensures that the next sign occurs after the previous one.
- The annotated version correctly describes the state transitions and the overall logic of the function.

Given the problem statement and the example provided, the code correctly calculates the year in which all signs will occur. The formula used ensures that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one, as required by the problem.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment stated that the program was incorrect because the logic used to determine the next year for each sign was flawed. However, upon closer inspection, the formula used in the code is indeed correct and aligns with the requirements of the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided example.
