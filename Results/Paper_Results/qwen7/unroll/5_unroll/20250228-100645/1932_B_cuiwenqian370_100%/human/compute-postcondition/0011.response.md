Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of an integer `T` (number of test cases), followed by an integer `n` (length of the list `a`), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates a specific value based on the given list `a` and appends the result to a list. Finally, it writes the results for all test cases to standard output, each result on a new line.**
