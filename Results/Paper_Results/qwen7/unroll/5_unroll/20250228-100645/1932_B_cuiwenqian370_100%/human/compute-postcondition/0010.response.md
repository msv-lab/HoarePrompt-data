Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), along with a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6). For each test case, it performs some unspecified operations and returns a result based on the processed data.**

This description indicates that the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and returns a result after performing certain operations on the provided data.
