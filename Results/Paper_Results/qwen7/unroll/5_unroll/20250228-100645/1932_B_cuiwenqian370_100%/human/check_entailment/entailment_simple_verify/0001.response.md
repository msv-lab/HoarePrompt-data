### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is a valid approach for handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - It then splits the input into a list of strings and iterates over these strings to process each test case.

2. **Test Case Loop**:
   - For each test case, it correctly extracts the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a`).
   - It initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity `a[0]`.

3. **Calculation of Next Year**:
   - The loop calculates the next year when the next sign will occur. This is done using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.
     - This formula ensures that the next year is the smallest multiple of `a[i]` that is greater than or equal to `last_year + 1`.
   - This calculation is correct because it accounts for the fact that the tribe waits strictly after the previous sign has occurred.

4. **Appending Results**:
   - The result for each test case is appended to the `results` list as a string representation of the final year.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the results in the required format by joining the results list with newlines.

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:

- **Initialization**:
  - `input = sys.stdin.read()` correctly reads all input at once.
  - `data = input().split()` splits the input into a list of strings.
  - `index = 0` initializes the index to 0.
  - `T = int(data[index])` correctly extracts the number of test cases.
  - `index += 1` increments the index to move past the number of test cases.

- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - `n = int(data[index])` correctly extracts the number of signs for the current test case.
  - `index += 1` increments the index to move past the number of signs.
  - `a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` correctly extracts the periodicities for the current test case.
  - `index += n` increments the index to move past the periodicities.
  - `last_year = a[0]` initializes `last_year` with the first periodicity.
  - The loop correctly updates `last_year` for each subsequent sign using the formula `(last_year + 1 + a[i] - 1) // a[i] * a[i]`.

- **Appending Results**:
  - `results.append(str(last_year))` appends the final year to the results list.

- **Output**:
  - `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` correctly outputs the results in the required format.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, handles the input and output as specified, and calculates the correct years for the occurrences of the signs.

### Final:
**True**
