Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for the "Permutation game." Specifically, the program makes assumptions about the maximum value in the array `a` and the positions `pb` and `ps`, which do not cover all possible scenarios. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Game Logic**: The program does not simulate the game properly. It does not account for the fact that players can move to `p_x` on each turn, and it does not consider all possible sequences of moves for both players.

2. **Simplistic Assumptions**: The program assumes that the maximum value in `a` will always determine the outcome, which is not true. The actual outcome depends on the sequence of moves made by both players.

3. **Missing Simulation**: The program does not simulate the game for all possible moves of both players. It only considers a few specific cases and does not handle the dynamic nature of the game.

To illustrate, consider the following example:

- **Input**:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3 2
  4 1 2 3
  7 2 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**:
  - Bodya starts at position 3, and Sasha starts at position 2.
  - Possible moves for Bodya and Sasha need to be simulated for all possible sequences of moves.

The provided program does not simulate these moves correctly and instead makes simplistic assumptions, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
