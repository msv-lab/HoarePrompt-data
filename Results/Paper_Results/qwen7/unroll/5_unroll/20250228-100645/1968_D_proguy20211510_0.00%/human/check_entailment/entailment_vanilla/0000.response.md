Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case.
   - It reads the values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` for each test case.
   - It reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Max Value Check:**
   - The program checks if the scores at the starting positions of Bodya (`pb`) and Sasha (`ps`) are equal to the maximum value in the array `a`.
   - If both scores are equal to the maximum value, it prints "Draw".
   - If only Bodya's score is the maximum, it prints "Bodya".
   - If only Sasha's score is the maximum, it prints "Sasha".
   - This part handles some base cases correctly.

3. **Dynamic Scoring Calculation:**
   - The program initializes two lists `b` and `s` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha respectively.
   - It then iterates over the `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
   - The logic for updating the positions and scores seems to handle the movement and scoring rules correctly.
   - However, there are some issues in how the scores are calculated and stored.

4. **Score Accumulation:**
   - The program calculates the cumulative scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `preb` and `pres`.
   - It then calculates the final scores for Bodya and Sasha using the lists `ptsb` and `ptss`.
   - The logic for calculating the final scores seems to be flawed because it assumes that the maximum score will be achieved by following the path that includes the maximum value multiple times, which is not necessarily true.

5. **Final Comparison:**
   - The program compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the result accordingly.
   - This part of the logic is also flawed because it does not correctly account for all possible paths and strategies the players might take.

### Issues Identified:
- The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum score will always be achieved by following the path that includes the maximum value multiple times.
- The dynamic scoring calculation does not fully account for all possible paths and strategies the players might take.
- The program does not handle all edge cases and scenarios correctly.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the logic to determine the winner of the game. The scoring and path selection logic is flawed, leading to incorrect results in many cases.

**Correctness: **False**
