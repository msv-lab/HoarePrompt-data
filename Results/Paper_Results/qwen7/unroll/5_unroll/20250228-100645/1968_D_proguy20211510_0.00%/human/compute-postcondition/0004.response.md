Output State: The output state will depend on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. The loop processes different inputs for `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a` in each iteration, and based on these inputs, it prints either 'Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha'. Therefore, without specific input values, we cannot determine a fixed output state. Each iteration's output is determined by the comparison of scores between Sasha and Bodya, and the final result ('Draw', 'Bodya', or 'Sasha') is printed based on which player has the higher score.
