Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), and \( P_S \), along with arrays \( p \) and \( a \). For each test case, it determines whether 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' should be printed based on the maximum values in the arrays and their positions. The function iterates through the given inputs, calculates scores for 'Bodya' and 'Sasha', and compares them to decide the winner. If the scores are equal, it prints 'Draw'.**
