Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`.
   
2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop will execute based on the value of `int(input())`. Therefore, the state of the input variable needs to be considered.
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder and does not require explicit adjustment since its purpose is to iterate over the range.
   - The variables `MOD`, `t`, and `alpha` are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

3. **Formulate the State**:
   - Since the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer (which is guaranteed by the problem constraints), the key state to consider is the input itself.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the value of the input provided by `int(input())`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`MOD` is 1000000007, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `alpha` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the input must provide a positive integer**
