Reasoning:
1. The program correctly handles the case when \( n = k \geq 2 \): it prints a sequence of \( k \) occurrences of \( k \). This satisfies the requirement that exactly \( k \) cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. For the case when \( k = 1 \), the program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that only the original array (no cyclic shifts) is sorted, which meets the requirement.
3. In all other cases, the program prints -1, indicating that no valid array exists for those values of \( n \) and \( k \).

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the program appears to handle all specified conditions correctly. The logic matches the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
