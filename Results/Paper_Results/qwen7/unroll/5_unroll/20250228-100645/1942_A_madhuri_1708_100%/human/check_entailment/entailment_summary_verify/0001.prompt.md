You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

Let's call an array a sorted if a_1 \leq a_2 \leq \ldots \leq a_{n - 1} \leq
a_{n} .

You are given two of Farmer John's favorite integers, n and k . He challenges
you to find any array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} satisfying the following
requirements:

  * 1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9 for each 1 \leq i \leq n ; 
  * Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a , exactly k of them are sorted.^\dagger 

If there is no such array a , output -1 .

^\dagger The x -th (1 \leq x \leq n ) cyclic shift of the array a is a_x,
a_{x+1} \ldots a_n, a_1, a_2 \ldots a_{x - 1} . If c_{x, i} denotes the i 'th
element of the x 'th cyclic shift of a , exactly k such x should satisfy
c_{x,1} \leq c_{x,2} \leq \ldots \leq c_{x, n - 1} \leq c_{x, n} .

For example, the cyclic shifts for a = [1, 2, 3, 3] are the following:

  * x = 1 : [1, 2, 3, 3] (sorted); 
  * x = 2 : [2, 3, 3, 1] (not sorted); 
  * x = 3 : [3, 3, 1, 2] (not sorted); 
  * x = 4 : [3, 1, 2, 3] (not sorted). 

Input

The first line contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^3 ) —
the length of a and the number of sorted cyclic shifts a must have.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^3 .

Output

For each test case, print a single line:

  * if there is a valid array a , output n integers, representing a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{n} ; 
  * otherwise, output -1 . 

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2
    
    3 1
    
    3 2

Output

    1 1
    69420 69 420
    -1
    
Note

In the first testcase, a = [1, 1] satisfies n = 2, k = 2 :

The two cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2] and [a_2, a_1] , which are both [1,
1] and are sorted.

In the second testcase, a = [69\,420, 69, 420] satisfies n = 3, k = 1 :

The three cyclic shifts of a are [a_1, a_2, a_3] , [a_2, a_3, a_1] , [a_3,
a_1, a_2] , which are [69\,420, 69, 420] , [69, 420, 69\,420] , and [420,
69\,420, 69] , respectively.

Only [69, 420, 69\,420] is sorted.

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
        (n, k) = map(int, s.split())
        if k >= 2:
            if n == k:
                print(*[k for j in range(k)])
            else:
                print('-1')
        else:
            print(*[j + 1 for j in range(n)])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \( n \) and \( k \). It reads these integers from standard input, checks the relationship between \( n \) and \( k \), and prints either a sequence of \( k \) occurrences of \( k \) (if \( n = k \) and \( k \geq 2 \)), a sequence of numbers from 1 to \( n \) (if \( k = 1 \)), or -1 (otherwise). The output is printed to standard output, with each line corresponding to one test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to generate an array `a` of length `n` where exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.
   - The function needs to handle multiple test cases, each with different values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The function reads input from standard input (file or stdin).
   - It processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
   - It checks if `k` is at least 2:
     - If `k` equals `n`, it prints a sequence of `k` identical numbers (which will always be sorted).
     - Otherwise, it prints `-1` because it cannot satisfy the condition for `k < n`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic correctly handles the case when `k` equals `n` by printing a sequence of `k` identical numbers.
   - However, the logic for handling other cases (where `k < n`) is incorrect. Specifically, the code does not provide a way to generate an array where exactly `k` out of `n` cyclic shifts are sorted when `k < n`.

4. **Examples:**
   - For `n = 2` and `k = 2`: The code prints `[2, 2]`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 1`: The code prints `[1, 2, 3]`, which is incorrect because all cyclic shifts of `[1, 2, 3]` are sorted.
   - For `n = 3` and `k = 2`: The code prints `-1`, which is incorrect because a valid solution exists (e.g., `[69420, 69, 420]`).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The provided code does not correctly handle the general case where `k < n`. It only works for the specific case where `k = n`.

### Correctness:
**False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not provide a valid solution for cases where `k < n`.
