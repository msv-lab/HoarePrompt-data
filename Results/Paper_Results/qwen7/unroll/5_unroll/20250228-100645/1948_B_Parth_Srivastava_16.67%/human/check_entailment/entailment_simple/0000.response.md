Reasoning:

1. The program is designed to process multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (`m`) and then processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, the program should read the length of the array (`k`) and the array itself (`a`).
3. The function `func_1()` is supposed to process the array and check if it can be made sorted by performing the specified operations.
4. The logic inside `func_1()` correctly splits numbers greater than 10 into their individual digits and appends them to the list `c` while maintaining the order.
5. After processing the array, the function checks if the list `c` is sorted and appends 1 to the list `b` if it is, otherwise, it appends 0.
6. Finally, the main loop prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values in `b`.

However, there are a few issues with the implementation:
- The variable `b` is not initialized before being used in the main loop.
- The main loop should iterate over the test cases and print the results based on the values in `b`.

Given these points, the program is almost correct but needs minor adjustments to ensure it works properly.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the program, initialize `b` before the main loop and ensure the main loop correctly processes and prints the results. Here's the corrected version:

```python
m = int(input())
b = []

for i in range(m):
    func_1()

for i in range(m):
    if b[i] == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

def func_1():
    k = int(input())
    a = input().split()
    a = list(map(int, a))
    x = 0
    y = 0
    n = 0
    c = []
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y >= c[n - 1]:
                if y <= x:
                    c.append(y)
                    c.append(x)
                    n = n + 2
                else:
                    c.append(a[i])
                    n = n + 1
        elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
            x = int(a[i] % 10)
            y = int(a[i] / 10)
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
        
    d = sorted(c)
    if c == d:
        b.append(1)
    else:
        b.append(0)
```

With these changes, the program should work correctly.
