Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in the list `c`, `c` is a list of integers where integers greater than 10 have been processed according to the conditions in the loop, `d` is a sorted version of the list `c`, and `b` is either a list with the value 1 appended to it or a list containing 0, depending on whether `c` is equal to the sorted version `d`.**
