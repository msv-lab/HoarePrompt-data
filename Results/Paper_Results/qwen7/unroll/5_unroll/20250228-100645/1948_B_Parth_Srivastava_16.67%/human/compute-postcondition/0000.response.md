Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `k = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `k`. The variable `t` remains unchanged, so it is still a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^3. The other information about the initial state remains valid as well.
