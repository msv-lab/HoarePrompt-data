Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operation. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the array contains elements that are single digits (i.e., less than 10). According to the problem description, the operation can only be applied to elements that are at least 10. However, the program attempts to apply the operation to all elements, including those that are less than 10, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
2
9 10
```

The correct output should be "NO" because the element 9 cannot be split into digits since it is less than 10. However, the program will attempt to split 9, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not handle this case correctly and is thus incorrect.
