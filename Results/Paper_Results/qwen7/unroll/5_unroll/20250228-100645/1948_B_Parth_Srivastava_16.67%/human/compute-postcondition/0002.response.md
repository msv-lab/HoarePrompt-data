Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^3, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each part to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, a.split()))` splits the string `a` into parts based on spaces and converts each part to an integer. This results in `a` being a list of integers. The values of `t` and `k` remain unchanged.
