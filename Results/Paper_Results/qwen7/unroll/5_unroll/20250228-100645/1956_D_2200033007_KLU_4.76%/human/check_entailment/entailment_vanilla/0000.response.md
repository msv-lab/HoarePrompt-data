Reasoning:
1. The problem requires us to maximize the sum of the elements in the array using at most \(5 \times 10^5\) operations.
2. The provided solution does not actually implement the logic to find the maximum sum and the operations needed to achieve it. Instead, it uses hardcoded values for different lengths of the array.
3. For \(n = 2\), the solution correctly outputs `4 1` and `1 2`, which means setting both elements to 2 maximizes the sum.
4. For \(n = 3\), the solution incorrectly outputs `13 0`, implying no operations are needed to maximize the sum, but this is not generally true.
5. For \(n = 4\), the solution outputs `105 2` with specific operations, but it doesn't show how these operations were derived.
6. The solution does not handle general cases where the array might contain unique values or require multiple operations to maximize the sum.

Given that the solution does not provide a general algorithm to solve the problem and instead relies on hardcoded values, it is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
