### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and its behavior step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into the list `a`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls the function `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array `a`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes an argument `c` (which is the length of the array `a`).
   - If `c` is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

Now, let's consider the problem requirements and the examples provided:

- **Example 1:** Input: `2` followed by `0 1`. Expected Output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`.
  - The program correctly prints `4 1` and `1 2`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 2:** Input: `3` followed by `1 3 9`. Expected Output: `13 0`.
  - The program correctly prints `13 0`, which matches the expected output.

- **Example 3:** Input: `4` followed by `1 100 2 1`. Expected Output: `105 2` followed by `3 3` and `3 4`.
  - The program prints `13 0`, which is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum.

- **Example 4:** Input: `1` followed by `0`. Expected Output: `1 1` followed by `1 1`.
  - The program prints `13 0`, which is incorrect because it does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum.

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not correctly handle all cases. Specifically, it fails to maximize the sum of the array elements for arrays of length greater than 2. The function `func_1` is hardcoded to print fixed outputs based on the length of the array, rather than performing the required operations to maximize the sum.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not implement the required functionality to maximize the sum of the array elements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
