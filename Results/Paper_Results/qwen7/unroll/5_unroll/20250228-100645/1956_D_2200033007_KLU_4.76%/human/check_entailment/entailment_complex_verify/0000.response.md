### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not implement the required functionality. Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the annotated version:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the length of the array `n` and then reads the array elements into the list `a`.

2. **Calling the Function:**
   - The program calls `func_1(len(a))` with the length of the array `c`.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `c` as input but actually uses its length `c`.
   - If the length of the list is 2, it prints `4 1` and `1 2`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `13 0`.

Given the problem description, the program needs to maximize the sum of the array elements by performing operations. However, the function `func_1` does not perform any operations to modify the array. Instead, it prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, which is incorrect.

Let's consider the examples provided:

- **Example 1:** Input: `2 0 1`
  - Expected Output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`
  - Actual Output: `4 1` followed by `1 2`
  - This is correct for this specific case.

- **Example 2:** Input: `3 1 3 9`
  - Expected Output: `13 0`
  - Actual Output: `13 0`
  - This is incorrect because the program does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.

- **Example 3:** Input: `4 1 100 2 1`
  - Expected Output: `105 2` followed by two operations to change the array to `[1, 100, 2, 2]`
  - Actual Output: `13 0`
  - This is incorrect because the program does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.

- **Example 4:** Input: `1 0`
  - Expected Output: `1 1` followed by `1 1`
  - Actual Output: `13 0`
  - This is incorrect because the program does not perform any operations to maximize the sum.

Since the program does not perform any operations to maximize the sum of the array elements and instead prints a fixed output based on the length of the array, the original assessment is correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
