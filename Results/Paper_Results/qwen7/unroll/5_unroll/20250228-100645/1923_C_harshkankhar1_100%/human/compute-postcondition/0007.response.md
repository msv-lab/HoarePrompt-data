Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for _ in range(q):`. The only variable mentioned here is `q`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `q`**: According to the provided state before the loop starts, `q` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq q \leq 3 \times 10^5\).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0. Since `q` is a positive integer, the loop will always execute at least once unless `q` is set to 0.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can execute, which means `q` should be greater than 0.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `q` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`q` must be greater than 0**
