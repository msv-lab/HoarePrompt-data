Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input by reading the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, the array `a`, and the array `b`. This part is correct.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly identifies and handles the edge case where both arrays `a` and `b` contain identical values. In this case, the total difference `D` is zero, and the program prints `0` and continues to the next test case. This is correct.

3. **Sorting Arrays**: The program sorts the arrays `a` and `b` in different orders: `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order. This is a good strategy to maximize the differences between corresponding elements.

4. **Calculation of Maximum Difference**: The program iterates through the sorted arrays and calculates the maximum difference at each step. It uses two pointers `i` and `j` to traverse the sorted arrays and accumulates the maximum absolute differences. This logic is sound and should work for the given constraints.

5. **Output**: The program prints the accumulated difference `ans` for each test case, which is the desired output.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output based on the problem description and the provided examples.

Correctness: **True**
