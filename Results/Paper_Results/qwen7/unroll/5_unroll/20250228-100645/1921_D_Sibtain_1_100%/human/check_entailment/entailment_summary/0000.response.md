Reasoning:
The provided program seems to follow the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program should be correct:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case where both arrays `a` and `c` contain identical and constant values. In such a scenario, it prints `0`, which is the expected result since no difference can be achieved.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The program sorts array `a` in ascending order and array `c` in descending order. This approach ensures that the largest possible differences are considered when pairing elements from `a` and `c`.

3. **Pairing Elements**: The program pairs elements from the sorted arrays `a` and `c` to maximize the differences. It iterates through the elements, ensuring that the maximum possible difference is added to the total sum at each step.

4. **Handling Single Element Arrays**: For the special case where `a` or `c` contains only one element, the program correctly computes the maximum possible difference between that single element and the maximum and minimum elements in the other array.

5. **Overall Logic**: The overall logic of the program aligns with the objective of maximizing the total difference `D`. By sorting and pairing elements in the specified manner, the program aims to achieve the highest possible sum of absolute differences.

Given these points, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
