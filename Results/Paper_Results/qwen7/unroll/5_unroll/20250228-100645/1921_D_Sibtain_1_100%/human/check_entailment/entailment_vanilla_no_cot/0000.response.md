Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly addresses the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it works:

1. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - If both `a` and `c` arrays contain identical elements, the difference `D` would be zero, which is handled correctly.
   
2. **Sorting Arrays**:
   - Sorting `a` in ascending order and `c` in descending order helps maximize the differences between corresponding elements. This is because the largest element in `c` should ideally be matched with the smallest element in `a`, and vice versa, to maximize the absolute differences.

3. **Iterating Through Elements**:
   - The loop iterates through each element of `a` and tries to match it with the most suitable element in `c` to maximize the difference. It alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements in `c` to ensure the maximum possible difference.

4. **Calculating Differences**:
   - For each element in `a`, the code calculates the maximum possible difference by considering both the smallest and largest remaining elements in `c`. This ensures that the overall difference `D` is maximized.

Given these points, the solution correctly implements the logic to achieve the maximum possible difference `D` for each test case. Therefore, the provided program is correct.
