### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array minimizes the differences between consecutive elements, thereby maximizing the overall sum of differences.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the beauty by summing the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting ensures that the smallest elements are placed next to each other, minimizing the differences and maximizing the beauty.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases by reading the input in a stream and processing each one separately.
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the size `n` and the array `array`, sorts the array using `func_1`, and prints the result.

4. **Verification with Examples:**
   - For the first test case: `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. The beauty is `(2-1) + (3-2) = 2`.
   - For the second test case: `[69, 69, 69]`, the beauty is `0` since all elements are the same.
   - For the third test case: `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`. The beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 57`.
   - For the fourth test case: `[3, 4, 3, 3]`, sorting gives `[3, 3, 3, 4]`. The beauty is `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.
   - For the fifth test case: `[2, 1]`, sorting gives `[1, 2]`. The beauty is `(2-1) = 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Both functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) correctly implement the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State:**
  - Before `func_2` is called, `t` is read from the input, and `index` is set to 1.
  - `results` is initialized as an empty list.

- **Processing Each Test Case:**
  - For each test case, `n` is read, and the array is read and converted to integers.
  - `func_1` is called with the array, and the result is stored in `results`.

- **Final State:**
  - After processing all test cases, the results are printed.

### Conclusion:
- The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case by sorting the array and calculating the beauty, and prints the results accurately.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
