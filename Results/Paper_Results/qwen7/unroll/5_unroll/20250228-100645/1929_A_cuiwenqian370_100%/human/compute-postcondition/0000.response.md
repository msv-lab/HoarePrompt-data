Output State: **`input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. The function `func_1` is expected to compute the maximum beauty of the array.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.read` does not change the values of the variables but rather reassigns the `input` variable to the function `sys.stdin.read`. This function reads the entire standard input stream as a single string. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `array`) remain unchanged from their initial state. The function `func_1` remains as a function expected to compute the maximum beauty of the array, but its definition and behavior are not altered by this line of code.
