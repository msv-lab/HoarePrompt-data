Output State: **`t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not change the values of the other variables but adds a new variable `results` to the state.
