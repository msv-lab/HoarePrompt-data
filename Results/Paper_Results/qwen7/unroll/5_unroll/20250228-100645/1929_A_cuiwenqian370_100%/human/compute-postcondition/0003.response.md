Output State: **`t` is now the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `array` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9], `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `index` is 1.**

The code `index = 1` simply assigns the value 1 to the variable `index`. No other changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged except for the assignment to `index`.
