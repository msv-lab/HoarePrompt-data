Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, i.e., \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` sorts the array and then calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences are minimized in magnitude but does not necessarily maximize the overall sum of these differences.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - Consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`.
   - Sorting the array gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`.
   - Calculating the beauty: \((54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57\).
   - This is indeed the correct maximum beauty for this array when optimally arranged as `[43, 90, 54, 80, 100]`.

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` reads input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the results.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - While `func_2` correctly processes the input and calls `func_1`, `func_1` itself does not always find the optimal arrangement of the array to maximize the beauty.
   - The original assessment is correct because the provided solution does not guarantee the maximum beauty for all possible rearrangements of the array.

Final: **False**
