Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \). To maximize this, we should sort the array and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting the array ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are minimized, leading to the maximum possible beauty.

3. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads input from standard input, processes it to extract the number of test cases (`t`), and then processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it extracts the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself, sorts the array using `func_1`, and calculates the beauty.
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

4. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The solution correctly handles the sorting and calculation of the beauty for each test case.
   - The input processing logic is correct, ensuring that the correct number of elements is processed for each test case.
   - The constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 500, 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are respected.

5. **Overall Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by sorting and calculating the sum of absolute differences.
   - It handles multiple test cases and processes each one appropriately.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
