Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array, defined as the sum of the values \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for all integers \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
- To maximize the beauty, we should sort the array and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. This is because sorting ensures that the largest possible differences are between adjacent elements, thereby maximizing the beauty.
- Function `func_1` correctly sorts the array and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, which is the maximum beauty for the given array.
- Function `func_2` reads the input data, processes each test case by calling `func_1`, and prints the results. It correctly handles multiple test cases and ensures that the input is processed as required.
- Given that both functions work as intended and together they process the input correctly and produce the correct output, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
