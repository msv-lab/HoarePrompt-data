You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp is working on his new site, and the current challenge is to make the
users pick strong passwords.

Monocarp decided that strong passwords should satisfy the following
conditions:

  * password should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits; 
  * there should be no digit that comes after a letter (so, after each letter, there is either another letter or the string ends); 
  * all digits should be sorted in the non-decreasing order; 
  * all letters should be sorted in the non-decreasing order. 

Note that it's allowed for the password to have only letters or only digits.

Monocarp managed to implement the first condition, but he struggles with the
remaining ones. Can you help him to verify the passwords?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 20 )
— the length of the password.

The second line contains a string, consisting of exactly n characters. Each
character is either a lowercase Latin letter or a digit.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if the given password is strong and "NO"
otherwise.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    12ac
    
    5
    
    123wa
    
    9
    
    allllmost
    
    5
    
    ac123
    
    6
    
    011679

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the second testcase, the letters are not sorted in the non-decreasing
order.

In the fourth testcase, there is a digit that comes after a letter — digit '1'
after a letter 'c'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates over the test cases, extracting the length of the password and the password itself for each case.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function processes a single password.
   - It separates the characters into two lists: one for digits and one for letters.
   - It checks if any digit appears after a letter by tracking the last digit index.
   - It checks if the digits and letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns 'NO'.
   - If all conditions pass, it returns 'YES'.

### Detailed Check

1. **Condition Checking:**
   - **No digit after a letter:** The code correctly tracks the last digit index and checks if a letter appears before any digit.
   - **Digits sorted in non-decreasing order:** The code sorts the digits list and compares it with the original list.
   - **Letters sorted in non-decreasing order:** The code sorts the letters list and compares it with the original list.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Only digits:** The code will correctly identify this as a valid password since digits are inherently sorted.
   - **Only letters:** The code will correctly identify this as a valid password since letters are inherently sorted.
   - **Mixed letters and digits:** The code correctly handles this by ensuring no digit appears before a letter and both groups are sorted.

### Example Test Cases

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Case 1:** `12ac`
  - Digits: ['1', '2']
  - Letters: ['a', 'c']
  - Sorted: Yes
  - No digit before a letter: Yes
  - Result: 'YES'

- **Case 2:** `123wa`
  - Digits: ['1', '2', '3']
  - Letters: ['w', 'a']
  - Sorted: Yes
  - No digit before a letter: No (digit '1' before 'w')
  - Result: 'NO'

- **Case 3:** `allllmost`
  - Digits: []
  - Letters: ['a', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'l', 'o', 's', 't']
  - Sorted: Yes
  - No digit before a letter: Yes
  - Result: 'YES'

- **Case 4:** `ac123`
  - Digits: ['1', '2', '3']
  - Letters: ['a', 'c']
  - Sorted: Yes
  - No digit before a letter: No (digit '1' before 'a')
  - Result: 'NO'

- **Case 5:** `011679`
  - Digits: ['0', '1', '1', '6', '7', '9']
  - Letters: []
  - Sorted: Yes
  - No digit before a letter: Yes
  - Result: 'YES'

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to check if a password meets the specified conditions. Therefore, the given program is correct.
