Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the area of the square in all cases. The logic to determine which pairs of points form the sides of the square is flawed. It assumes that the points are given in a specific order or configuration, which is not guaranteed. A more robust approach would be to identify the unique x and y values among the four points and then calculate the differences to find the side length of the square.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        points = []
        for _ in range(4):
            x, y = map(int, input().split())
            points.append((x, y))
        
        # Find the unique x and y values
        x_values = sorted(set(point[0] for point in points))
        y_values = sorted(set(point[1] for point in points))
        
        # Calculate the side length of the square
        side_length = abs(x_values[1] - x_values[0])
        
        # Verify the side length using y values
        assert abs(y_values[1] - y_values[0]) == side_length, "The points do not form a square"
        
        # Print the area of the square
        print(side_length ** 2)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program can handle any permutation of the corner points and still correctly identify the side length of the square.
