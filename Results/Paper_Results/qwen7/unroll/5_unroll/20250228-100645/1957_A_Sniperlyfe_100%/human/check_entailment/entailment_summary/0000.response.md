Reasoning:
The provided program aims to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be constructed using the given sticks. The logic in `func_1` is to count the frequency of each stick length and then determine how many sets of three sticks (minimum required to form a triangle, the simplest polygon) can be made from these counts.

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation:
1. The program should consider the smallest polygon type (triangle) instead of just checking divisibility by 3.
2. The program should return the minimum number of polygons that can be formed, not the sum of the integer divisions by 3.

To fix this, the program should:
- Calculate the frequency of each stick length.
- Determine the minimum number of complete polygons (triangles, squares, etc.) that can be formed based on the smallest polygon type.

Given the current logic, the program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of polygons. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
