Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter test_cases, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains two elements: an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5) representing the number of sticks, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 ≤ a_i ≤ n) representing the exponents used to determine the lengths of the sticks as 2^{a_i}. The function returns a result based on the given test cases.**
