Functionality: **The function accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing exponents used to determine stick lengths. For each test case, it calculates the number of unique triplets and pairs of sticks that can be formed, and sums these values. The function then returns a list of integers, where each integer corresponds to the calculated result for each test case.**
