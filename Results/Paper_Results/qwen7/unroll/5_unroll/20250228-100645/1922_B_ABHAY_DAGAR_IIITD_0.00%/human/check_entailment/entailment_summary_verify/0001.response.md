### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to count the number of ways to choose 3 sticks such that they can form a non-degenerate triangle. For three lengths to form a triangle, the sum of any two must be greater than the third.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It defines a function `func_1` which processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of exponents `a_i`.
   - It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent.
   - It calculates the number of ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) * (cnt - 2) // 6`).
   - It also calculates the number of ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length (`cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2 * total_count`), where `total_count` keeps track of the total number of sticks processed so far.
   - Finally, it prints the result for each test case.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - The logic for counting ways to choose 3 sticks of the same length is correct.
   - However, the logic for counting ways to choose 2 sticks of one length and 1 stick of another length is flawed. The current implementation assumes that any combination of two sticks of one length and one stick of another length will form a triangle, which is not necessarily true. For example, if we have sticks of lengths \(2^3\), \(2^3\), and \(2^3\), the combination \(2^3 + 2^3 < 2^3\) does not satisfy the triangle inequality.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where there are fewer than 3 sticks (result will be 0).
   - It correctly handles cases where the same length appears multiple times and calculates combinations accordingly.
   - However, the logic for counting valid triangles is incorrect because it does not check the triangle inequality condition.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly implement the logic to check the triangle inequality condition. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for some test cases.

**Final: False**
