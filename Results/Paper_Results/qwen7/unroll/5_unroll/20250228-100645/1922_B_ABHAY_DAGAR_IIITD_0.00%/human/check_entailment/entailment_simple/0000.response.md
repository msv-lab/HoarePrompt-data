Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of sticks `n` and the list of exponents `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It uses a dictionary `num_of_lens` to count occurrences of each exponent.
4. The logic to calculate the number of ways to form a triangle is correct:
   - If there are at least 3 sticks with the same exponent, they can form a degenerate triangle (which has an area of 0), but since we need a non-degenerate triangle (area > 0), these cases are not considered.
   - If there are at least 2 sticks with the same exponent, they can pair with any other stick to form a triangle, except when the third stick has the same exponent, which would form a degenerate triangle.
5. The program calculates the number of valid combinations and appends the result to the `results` list.
6. Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

Given the logic and the steps followed, the program appears to be correct according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
