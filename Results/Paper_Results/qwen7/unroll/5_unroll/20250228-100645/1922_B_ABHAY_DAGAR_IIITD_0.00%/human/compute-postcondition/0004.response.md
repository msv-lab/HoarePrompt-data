Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `result`, which is being iterated over from the `results` list.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. Therefore, we need to ensure that the `results` list is not empty at the start of the loop.

3. **Current State**: The current state is given as:
   - `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
   - `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the calculated result based on the operations performed inside the loop for each corresponding test case.

4. **Adjust the State**: For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. If `results` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the `results` list to ensure it contains at least one element.

**State:**
**`results` is a list of integers that must contain at least one element.**
