Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(test_cases)`. The loop variable here is `_`, but since it is a placeholder (often used when the loop variable is not needed), we focus on the object being iterated over, which is `test_cases`.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: For the loop to execute, `test_cases` must contain at least one element. This is because the `range()` function will generate a sequence from 0 to `len(test_cases) - 1`, and if `test_cases` is empty, the range will be empty, and the loop will not execute.

3. **Consider the initial state**: The initial state given is that `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is an empty list.

4. **Adjust the state**: Since the loop depends on `test_cases` having at least one tuple, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is non-empty.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`test_cases` must be a non-empty list of tuples, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and `results` is an empty list**.
