Output State: **`i` is 0; `j` is the length of `arr` - 1**

Explanation: The variable `j` is assigned the value of `len(arr) - 1`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The length of `arr` (denoted as `n`) is used to initialize `j`, but `n` itself is not updated or referenced further in the given code snippet.
