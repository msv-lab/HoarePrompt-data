Reasoning:
1. The `func_1` function is intended to update the coordinates of a player based on the movement direction.
2. However, the function has a logical error. It returns `x + dx`, `y + dy` but does not actually update the coordinates of the player in the global `players` dictionary.
3. The function should modify the `players` dictionary directly to reflect the new position of the player.
4. The function currently does not have a return statement that updates the dictionary, so the changes are not persisted outside the function.

Given these issues, the function is not correctly updating the player's position in the `players` dictionary, leading to incorrect behavior in the main program.

Correctness: **False**
