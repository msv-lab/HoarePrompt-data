Precondition: **a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and both are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, each string containing M characters, and each character can be one of the following: '.', 'R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9', 'RG', 'BG', or '.Q'. Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'B2 U' for a blue player with number 2 moving up).**
