Output State: `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5; `inf` remains 200001; `values` remains a list where each index `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000) contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `values[0]` remains 0; for each iteration `_` in range(`t`), the program reads an integer `value` from input, calculates the sum of digits up to `value` if necessary, and prints the precomputed value from the `values` list.
