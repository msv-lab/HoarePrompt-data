### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these digit sums.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an array `values` where `values[i]` stores the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( i \).
   - It iterates through each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` array accordingly.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints `values[n]`, which gives the required sum.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) because for each integer \( i \) up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), we calculate the sum of its digits, which takes \( O(\log i) \) time.
   - The query step for each test case runs in \( O(1) \) since it just involves an array lookup.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The precomputation ensures that for any \( n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), the sum of the digit sums can be quickly retrieved.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation of the precomputation step. Specifically, the line `values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits` is incorrect. This line should instead be `values[i] = values[i - 1] + sum_value_digits - sum_value_digits_from_previous_i`. The current implementation incorrectly accumulates the sum of digits without properly resetting the sum for each new integer.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle the edge case where the sum of digits needs to be recalculated from scratch for each new integer. This leads to incorrect results for larger values of \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the flawed implementation of the precomputation step. The current approach accumulates the sum of digits incorrectly, leading to wrong results for larger values of \( n \).

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
