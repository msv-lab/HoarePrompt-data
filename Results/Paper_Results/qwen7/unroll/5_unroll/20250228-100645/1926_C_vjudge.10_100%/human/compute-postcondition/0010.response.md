Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) and then reads `t` integers `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200000). It calculates the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `n` and stores these sums in a list. Finally, for each `n` in a test case, it prints the precomputed sum of digits up to `n`.**
