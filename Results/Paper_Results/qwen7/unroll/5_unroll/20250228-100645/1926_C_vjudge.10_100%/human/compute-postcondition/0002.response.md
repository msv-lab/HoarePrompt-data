Output State: **`t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5; `inf` is 200001; `values` is a list of 200001 zeros.**

The code initializes a list named `values` with 200001 elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `inf` remain unchanged from their initial states.
