Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program uses a precomputed array `values` to store the cumulative sum of digit sums for all numbers up to \(2 \times 10^5\). However, this approach is not efficient and does not handle the problem as described. The problem requires calculating the sum of the digit sums for numbers from 1 to \(n\) for each test case, but the provided solution does not do this dynamically for each \(n\).

For example, consider the input `n = 13`. According to the problem description, the numbers on the board would be replaced as follows:
- 1 → 1
- 2 → 2
- 3 → 3
- 4 → 4
- 5 → 5
- 6 → 6
- 7 → 7
- 8 → 8
- 9 → 9
- 10 → 1 (sum of digits of 10 is 1)
- 11 → 2 (sum of digits of 11 is 2)
- 12 → 3 (sum of digits of 12 is 3)
- 13 → 4 (sum of digits of 13 is 4)

The sum of these numbers is \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 59\).

However, the provided program will use the precomputed array `values` which was filled up to 200000, and it will simply output the value at `values[13]`, which is not calculated correctly for \(n = 13\).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
