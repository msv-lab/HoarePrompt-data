Reasoning:
The provided code aims to solve the problem by precomputing the sum of the digits for all numbers from 1 to 200000 and storing these sums in an array called `values`. This allows for efficient querying of the sum of digits for any number up to 200000 in constant time.

Let's break down the logic and verify the correctness:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `inf` is set to 200001, which is used as the upper bound for the array `values`.
2. **Precomputation**: A loop runs from 1 to 200000, calculating the sum of the digits for each number and updating the `values` array accordingly. For each number `i`, the sum of its digits is computed and added to the cumulative sum stored in `values[i]`.
3. **Querying**: For each test case, the program reads an integer `n` and prints the value at `values[n]`, which corresponds to the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to `n`.

The key points to check for correctness are:
- The precomputation step correctly calculates the sum of digits for each number.
- The querying step uses the precomputed values correctly.

Given that the precomputation step iterates through all numbers from 1 to 200000 and correctly accumulates the sum of digits, and the querying step simply retrieves the precomputed value, the logic appears sound.

Since the problem constraints are met (the solution handles up to 10^4 test cases and each `n` up to 2 * 10^5 efficiently), and the logic follows the problem statement accurately, the provided code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
