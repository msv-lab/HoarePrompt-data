### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the sum of the digits of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then summing these digit sums.

2. **Approach Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1()` initializes an array `values` where `values[i]` stores the sum of the digit sums from 1 to \( i \).
   - It iterates through each integer from 1 to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), calculates the sum of its digits, and updates the `values` array accordingly.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \) and prints `values[n]`, which gives the required sum.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The precomputation step runs in \( O(n \log n) \) because for each integer \( i \) up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), we calculate the sum of its digits, which takes \( O(\log i) \) time.
   - The query step for each test case runs in \( O(1) \) since it just involves an array lookup.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The precomputation ensures that for any \( n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), the sum of the digit sums can be quickly retrieved.
   - However, there is a critical issue with the approach used to calculate the sum of the digits. Specifically, the function `func_1()` does not correctly compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \( n \). Instead, it computes the cumulative sum of the digits for all numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \), which is not what the problem requires.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution does not handle the actual requirement of computing the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \( n \) and then summing those results. Instead, it precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) and then uses this precomputed data.
   - This means that for any \( n > 2 \times 10^5 \), the solution will not work as intended because the precomputed data does not cover such large values of \( n \).

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly compute the sum of the digits for each number from 1 to \( n \) and then sum those results. Instead, it precomputes the sum of digits for all numbers up to \( 2 \times 10^5 \) and uses this precomputed data, which is not sufficient for the problem requirements.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
