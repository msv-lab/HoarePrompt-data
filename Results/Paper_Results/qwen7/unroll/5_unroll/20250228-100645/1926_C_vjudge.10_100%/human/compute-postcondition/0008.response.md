Output State: `values` is a list where each index `i` (1 ≤ `i` ≤ 200000) contains the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to `i`, and `values[0]` is 0; `t` is an input integer, 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4; for each iteration of the loop, `value` is an integer read from input, 1 ≤ `value` ≤ 200000, and the corresponding element in `values` is printed.
