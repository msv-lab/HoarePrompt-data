The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) and 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7) for each n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). For each test case, it sorts the input integers in ascending order, then sums the first number from each pair of consecutive numbers in the sorted list. The function returns a list containing the sum for each test case, with each sum printed on a new line.
