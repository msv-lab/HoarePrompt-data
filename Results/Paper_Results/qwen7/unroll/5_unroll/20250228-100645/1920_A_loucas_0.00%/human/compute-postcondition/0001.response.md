State: **`loop` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `loop` ≤ 500, `iterable` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains two variables: `iterable` and `loop`.
2. For the loop to execute, the condition `0 <= iterable < loop` must be true.
3. At the start of the loop, `iterable` should be initialized to 0.
4. The value of `loop` must be within the specified range (1 to 500) for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect these conditions.
