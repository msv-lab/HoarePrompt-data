Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to satisfy the conditions \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\). The current implementation simply sets \(a_0\) to 500 and then iteratively calculates \(a_i\) as \(a_{i-1} + x_{i-1}\), which does not guarantee that the modulo condition will be met.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that each \(a_i\) is chosen such that the modulo condition holds. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        x = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a = [0] * n
        # Set a_1 to a value greater than or equal to x_1
        a[0] = x[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            # Ensure a_i is at least x_i + a_{i-1}
            a[i] = x[i] + a[i - 1]
        print(*a)
```

This revised solution initializes \(a_1\) to \(x_1\) and then ensures each subsequent \(a_i\) is large enough to satisfy the modulo condition. This approach guarantees that \(x_i = a_i \bmod a_{i-1}\) holds true for all \(2 \leq i \leq n\).
