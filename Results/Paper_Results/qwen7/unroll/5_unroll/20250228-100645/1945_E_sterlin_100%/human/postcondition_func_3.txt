The function processes a test case defined by an integer `t` (between 1 and 20,000), and a permutation `p` of length `n` (where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 200,000 and 1 ≤ x ≤ n). It returns a string containing two integers separated by a space, followed by the same permutation `p` of distinct integers from 1 to n.
