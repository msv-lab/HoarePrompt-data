Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Inputs**:
   - The program correctly defines five functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, `func_5`), but only `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3` are actually used in the main logic.
   - `func_1` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - `func_2` reads the values of `n` and `x` for each test case.
   - `func_3` reads the permutation `p`.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The main logic of the program correctly identifies the position of `x` in the permutation `p` using a modified binary search approach.
   - The program ensures that the binary search works by performing at most 2 swaps to make sure `x` is in the middle of the array when the binary search is applied.
   - The logic checks if `x` is already in the correct position (`left` index) and performs swaps if necessary to ensure the binary search can find `x`.

3. **Swapping Logic**:
   - The program correctly handles the case where `x` is not initially in the correct position by finding the first missing index in the `seen` array and swapping `x` with that index.
   - It also handles the case where `x` is not the first missing index by swapping `x` with the `left` index to ensure the binary search can find `x`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the number of swaps performed and the indices of the swaps, which matches the requirements.

Given the above analysis, the provided code meets the problem description and performs the required operations correctly.

Correctness: **True**
