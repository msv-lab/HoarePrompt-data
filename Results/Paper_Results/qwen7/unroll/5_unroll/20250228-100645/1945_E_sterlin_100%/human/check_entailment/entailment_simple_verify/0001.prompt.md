You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Anton got bored during the hike and wanted to solve something. He asked Kirill
if he had any new problems, and of course, Kirill had one.

You are given a permutation p of size n , and a number x that needs to be
found. A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers
from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

You decided that you are a cool programmer, so you will use an advanced
algorithm for the search — binary search. However, you forgot that for binary
search, the array must be sorted.

You did not give up and decided to apply this algorithm anyway, and in order
to get the correct answer, you can perform the following operation no more
than 2 times before running the algorithm: choose the indices i , j (1\le i, j
\le n ) and swap the elements at positions i and j .

After that, the binary search is performed. At the beginning of the algorithm,
two variables l = 1 and r = n + 1 are declared. Then the following loop is
executed:

  1. If r - l = 1 , end the loop 
  2. m = \lfloor \frac{r + l}{2} \rfloor 
  3. If p_m \le x , assign l = m , otherwise r = m . 

The goal is to rearrange the numbers in the permutation before the algorithm
so that after the algorithm is executed, p_l is equal to x . It can be shown
that 2 operations are always sufficient.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 2\cdot 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follow
the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le x \le n
\le 2\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation and the number to be found.

The second line contains the permutation p separated by spaces (1 \le p_i \le
n ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output an integer k (0 \le k \le 2 ) on the first line —
the number of operations performed by you. In the next k lines, output 2
integers i , j (1 \le i, j \le n ) separated by a space, indicating that you
are swapping the elements at positions i and j .

Note that you do not need to minimize the number of operations.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at the position `l` when performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm should end with `p[l] == x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined such that it narrows down the range `[l, r]` until `r - l = 1`. It checks the middle element `m` and updates `l` or `r` based on whether `p[m] <= x` or `p[m] > x`.

3. **Swapping Elements**: We need to ensure that the element `x` is at the correct position `l` after the binary search. This can be achieved by swapping elements strategically.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `x` is already at position `l`, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is at position `r`, we need to swap `x` with an element in the lower half of the array.
   - If `x` is not at either `l` or `r`, we might need to swap `x` with another element to bring it closer to `l` or `r`.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not contain the logic for rearranging the permutation. Instead, it defines helper functions for reading input.
   - The core logic for solving the problem is missing from the given code.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - Since the provided code does not implement the required logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect.
