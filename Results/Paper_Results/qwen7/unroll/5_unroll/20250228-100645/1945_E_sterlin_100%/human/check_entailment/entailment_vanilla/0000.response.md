### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at the position `l` when performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm should end with `p[l] == x`.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm is defined such that it narrows down the range `[l, r]` until `r - l = 1`. It checks the middle element `m` and updates `l` or `r` based on whether `p[m] <= x` or `p[m] > x`.

3. **Swapping Elements**: We need to ensure that the element `x` is at the correct position `l` after the binary search. This can be achieved by swapping elements strategically.

4. **Possible Scenarios**:
   - If `x` is already at position `l`, no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is at position `r`, we need to swap `x` with an element in the lower half of the array.
   - If `x` is not at either `l` or `r`, we might need to swap `x` with another element to bring it closer to `l` or `r`.

5. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not contain the logic for rearranging the permutation. Instead, it defines helper functions for reading input.
   - The core logic for solving the problem is missing from the given code.

6. **Correctness Check**:
   - Since the provided code does not implement the required logic, it cannot be considered correct for the given problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
