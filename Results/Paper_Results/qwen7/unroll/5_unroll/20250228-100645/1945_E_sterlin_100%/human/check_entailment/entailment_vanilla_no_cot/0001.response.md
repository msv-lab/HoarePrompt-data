### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to rearrange a permutation using at most 2 swaps so that the element `x` is at position `l` when performing a binary search. The binary search algorithm is supposed to find `x` in the permutation after the swaps.

2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: The binary search algorithm described in the problem is slightly different from the standard one. It starts with `l = 1` and `r = n + 1`, and it ends when `r - l = 1`. This means the loop will run until `m` (the middle index) is such that `p[m] == x`.

3. **Swapping Strategy**:
   - We need to place `x` at the start of the array (`p[l]`) to ensure the binary search finds it.
   - To achieve this, we need to identify where `x` is currently located in the permutation.
   - If `x` is already at the start (`p[1]`), no swaps are needed.
   - If `x` is not at the start, we need to move it to the start using at most 2 swaps.

4. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The provided code does not implement the logic to rearrange the permutation as required.
   - The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`, `func_4`, and `func_5` are placeholders for input functions, which are correctly defined but not used in the main logic.
   - There is no function or logic that performs the necessary swaps to place `x` at the start of the array.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - Since the provided code does not contain any logic to rearrange the permutation, it cannot possibly satisfy the problem requirements.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not contain any logic to rearrange the permutation as required by the problem statement.
