### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling and Validation:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, and then reads the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made, and the minimum number of cards remains `n`.

3. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function calculates the frequency of each card number, ensuring that no number appears more than `k` times. This is done using a dictionary `frequency_table`.
   - The logic inside `func_1` ensures that if a number's count exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.

4. **Output Determination:**
   - After calculating the frequency table, the program checks if `k` itself is present as a value in the frequency table.
     - If `k` is a value in the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`. This is correct because if `k` cards of the same number exist, they can be exchanged for `k - 1` new cards.
     - If `k` is not a value in the frequency table, it prints `n`. This is also correct because no further exchanges can reduce the number of cards below `n`.

5. **Functionality and Logic:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the input and returns the expected frequency table.
   - The main program logic correctly uses the output of `func_1` to determine the final number of cards.

### Conclusion:

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations. There are no logical errors or misinterpretations in the code.

### Correctness:
**True**
