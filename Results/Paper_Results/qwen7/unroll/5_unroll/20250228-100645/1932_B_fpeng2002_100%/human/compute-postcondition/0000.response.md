Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is now `num_tests`) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the value of `num_tests` will be an integer within this range. All other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) remain unaffected by this line of code.
