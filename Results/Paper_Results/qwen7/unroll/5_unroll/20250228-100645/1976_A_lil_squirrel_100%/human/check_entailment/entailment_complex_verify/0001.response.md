### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to check if a given password meets specific criteria.
   - The password must consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
   - All letters must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - All digits must be sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - There should be no digit immediately following a letter.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the password length (`n`) and the password itself.
   - It then separates the password into two lists: `letters` and `digits`.
   - It checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter.
   - If any of these conditions fail, it returns "NO". Otherwise, it returns "YES".

3. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the password into letters and digits.
   - It checks the sorting of both `letters` and `digits` lists.
   - It correctly identifies invalid sequences where a digit follows a letter.
   - The logic flow is consistent with the problem statement.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles empty strings and strings with only letters or only digits correctly.
   - It correctly handles strings with mixed letters and digits.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the original assessment, there is a subtle issue with the implementation that was not fully addressed in the original assessment.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Separation of Letters and Digits:**
  - The code correctly separates the password into `letters` and `digits` lists.
  
- **Sorting Checks:**
  - The code checks if the `letters` and `digits` lists are sorted in non-decreasing order using the `sorted()` function. This is correct.

- **Digit Following a Letter Check:**
  - The code iterates through the password to ensure there is no digit immediately following a letter. This is also correct.

- **Issue with Edge Case Handling:**
  - The code does not handle the case where the password consists solely of digits. According to the problem statement, a password can consist only of digits, and such a password should be considered strong if it is sorted in non-decreasing order.
  - In the annotated code, the state after sorting the `digits` list is mentioned, but it does not explicitly handle the case where the password is composed entirely of digits.

### Example Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
1
5
12345
```

- The password is `12345`, which consists only of digits.
- The `digits` list is `['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']`.
- The `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- There are no letters, so the condition of no digit following a letter is trivially satisfied.
- The function should return "YES".

However, the code does not explicitly handle this case. The `if (digits != sorted(digits))` check will pass because `digits` is already sorted, but the function should still return "YES" for a password consisting only of digits.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment did not fully address the edge case where the password consists only of digits. While the code correctly implements the main logic, it fails to handle this specific edge case properly.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
