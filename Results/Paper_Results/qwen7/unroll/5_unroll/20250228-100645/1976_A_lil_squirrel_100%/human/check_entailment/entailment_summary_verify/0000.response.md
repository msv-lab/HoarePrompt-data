Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly separates the characters in the password into two lists: one for letters and one for digits.
   - It then checks if both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - It also ensures that no digit comes after a letter by iterating through the password and checking the ordering constraint.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles empty lists of letters and digits correctly, returning "YES" when there are no letters or digits.
   - It correctly identifies when the letters are not sorted, when the digits are not sorted, and when there is a digit immediately following a letter.

3. **Examples Verification**:
   - For "12ac": All conditions are met, so the output is "YES".
   - For "123wa": The letters are not sorted, so the output is "NO".
   - For "allllmost": All conditions are met, so the output is "YES".
   - For "ac123": All conditions are met, so the output is "YES".
   - For "011679": All conditions are met, so the output is "YES".

Given that the function correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
