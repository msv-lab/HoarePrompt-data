Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to verify whether a password meets the specified conditions. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the verification process:

1. **Separation of Characters**: The program correctly separates the characters in the password into two lists: one for letters (`letters`) and one for digits (`digits`).

2. **Sorting Check**: 
   - The program checks if the `letters` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(letters)`. If not, it returns 'NO'.
   - Similarly, it checks if the `digits` list is sorted in non-decreasing order using `sorted(digits)`. If not, it returns 'NO'.

3. **Digit After Letter Check**: 
   - The program iterates through the password and checks if any letter is immediately followed by a digit. If such a case is found, it returns 'NO'.

4. **Final Return**: 
   - If none of the above conditions fail, the function returns 'YES', indicating that the password is strong according to the given criteria.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the function correctly implements the necessary checks to validate the password against the specified conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
