Output State: **The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is equal to `nums[0] + k` and all other elements `nums[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) are equal to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being reduced accordingly by the value of `nums[i]` during each iteration.**

This means that the program returns a list `nums` with the following characteristics:
- The first element `nums[0]` starts as `nums[0] + k`.
- Each subsequent element `nums[i]` (where i ranges from 1 to n-1) is set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and the current value of `k`, and `k` is decreased by the value of `nums[i]` after setting it.
