You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given integers n and k , construct a sequence of n non-negative (i.e. \geq 0 )
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n such that

  1. \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n a_i = k 
  2. The number of 1 s in the binary representation of a_1 | a_2 | \ldots | a_n is maximized, where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq k \leq 10^9 ) — the number of non-negative integers to be
printed and the sum respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n on a new line that
satisfies the conditions given above.

If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Example

Input

    4
    
    1 5
    
    2 3
    
    2 5
    
    6 51

Output

    5
    1 2
    5 0
    3 1 1 32 2 12

Note

In the first test case, we have to print exactly one integer, hence we can
only output 5 as the answer.

In the second test case, we output 1, 2 which sum up to 3 , and 1 | 2 = (11)_2 has two 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

In the fourth test case, we output 3, 1, 1, 32, 2, 12 which sum up to 51 , and 3 | 1 | 1 | 32 | 2 | 12 = (101\,111)_2 has five 1 s in its binary representation, which is the maximum we can achieve in these constraints.

- Program: 
t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    result = func_1(n, k)
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, result)))
print('\n'.join(results))

def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
    k -= nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k > 0:
            nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)
            k -= nums[i]
    nums[0] += k
    return nums

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate an array of `n` integers that sum up to `k` and maximize the number of 1s in the bitwise OR of these integers.
   - The function initializes an array `nums` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It sets the first element `nums[0]` to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`. This value is the largest integer with `k.bit_length()` bits.
   - It subtracts this value from `k`.
   - For each subsequent element in the array, it tries to add the minimum possible value that keeps the sum correct and maximizes the number of 1s in the OR operation.

3. **Key Points to Check:**
   - **Initialization:** The first element is set to the largest integer with `k.bit_length()` bits, which is correct.
   - **Subsequent Elements:** Each subsequent element is set to `min(nums[0] + 1, k)`, which ensures that the sum constraint is met while trying to maximize the number of 1s.
   - **Final Adjustment:** The first element is adjusted to ensure the total sum is `k`.

### Detailed Verification:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `nums[0] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1` is correct because it sets the first element to the largest integer with `k.bit_length()` bits.

2. **Subsequent Elements:**
   - `nums[i] = min(nums[0] + 1, k)` ensures that each subsequent element is as large as possible without exceeding `k`.
   - This approach guarantees that the sum of the array is `k` and tries to maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation.

3. **Final Adjustment:**
   - After setting the values, the first element is adjusted to ensure the total sum is `k`.

### Conclusion:

The provided program seems to follow the logic correctly. It initializes the first element to the largest possible value with the given bit length, and then fills the rest of the array with values that maximize the number of 1s in the OR operation while maintaining the sum constraint.
