Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate a sequence of `n` non-negative integers such that their sum equals `k` and the number of `1`s in the binary representation of their bitwise OR is maximized.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` aims to create a sequence of `n` numbers whose sum is `k`.
   - The first element `nums[0]` is set to `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is the largest number with `k` bits (i.e., `2^(k.bit_length()) - 2`). This ensures that the first number contributes significantly to maximizing the number of `1`s in the OR operation.
   - Subsequent elements are set to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, ensuring that the remaining sum `k` is distributed among the rest of the elements while keeping the OR result as high as possible.
   - Finally, the remaining sum `k` is added to `nums[0]` to ensure the total sum of the sequence is `k`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is very small, the first element might be too large, but the subsequent elements will adjust to fit the remaining sum.
   - For larger `k`, the first element will be appropriately large, and the rest will be smaller, still contributing to the maximum OR result.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic ensures that the sum constraint is met.
   - The bitwise OR operation will benefit from having the highest possible values early in the sequence, which is achieved by setting `nums[0]` to the largest possible value with `k` bits.
   - The subsequent elements are adjusted to fit the remaining sum, ensuring the total sum is `k`.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to maximize the number of `1`s in the bitwise OR of the sequence while satisfying the sum constraint.

Correctness: **True**
