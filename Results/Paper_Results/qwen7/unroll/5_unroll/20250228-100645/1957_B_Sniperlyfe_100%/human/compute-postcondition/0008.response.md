Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where the first element `nums[0]` is equal to `nums[0] + k`, and all other elements `nums[i]` (for i from 1 to n-1) are equal to the minimum of `nums[0] + 1` and `k`, with `k` being reduced accordingly by the value of `nums[i]` during each iteration.**
