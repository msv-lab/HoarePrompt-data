Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that `i` is initially set to 1 and that `i` remains less than `n` throughout the loop iterations.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment

1. **Initial Value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < n`.

Since the loop starts with `i` set to 1, we need to ensure that `i` remains within the range `[1, n)` for the loop to execute correctly. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is 1 and that `n` is greater than 1.

### Final State

- `i` should be 1.
- `n` should be greater than 1.

Thus, the modified state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
