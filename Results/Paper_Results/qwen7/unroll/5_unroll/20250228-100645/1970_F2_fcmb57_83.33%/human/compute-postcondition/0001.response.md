Output State: **a is split into x and y, b is split into dx and dy.**

The code `dx, dy = b` splits the value of `b` into two variables `dx` and `dy`. Since `b` was unchanged from its initial state where it was split into `x` and `y`, `b` is now also split into `dx` and `dy`. The initial state where `a` is split into `x` and `y` remains unchanged.
