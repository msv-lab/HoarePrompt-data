Reasoning:
1. **Field Initialization**: The program correctly initializes the field and reads the initial state of the game, including the positions of players, goals, the Quaffle, and the Bludger.
2. **Player Movements and Actions**: The program handles player movements and actions such as catching and throwing the Quaffle correctly. The `func_1` function updates the player's position based on the direction specified.
3. **Elimination Logic**: The logic for eliminating players when they collide with a Bludger is implemented correctly. The program checks if a player is in the same cell as a Bludger and prints the appropriate message.
4. **Scoring Logic**: The scoring logic is implemented correctly. When a player successfully scores in the opposing team's goal, the program prints the appropriate message and updates the score.
5. **Final Score Output**: The program correctly outputs the final score at the end of the game.

Given the provided annotated program and the reasoning above, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

Correctness: **True**
