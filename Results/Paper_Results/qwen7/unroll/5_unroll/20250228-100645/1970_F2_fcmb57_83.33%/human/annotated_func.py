#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers representing the dimensions N and M of the field, respectively, where 3 ≤ N, M ≤ 99 and N and M are odd. The field is represented as a list of strings, where each string contains M characters and there are N strings in total. The list contains characters representing empty cells ('..'), players ('R0' to 'R9', 'B0' to 'B9'), goals ('RG', 'BG'), the Quaffle ('.Q'), and a Bludger ('.B'). Additionally, the function takes a list of actions, where each action is a string describing the entity performing the action and the action itself (e.g., 'R0 D', 'R0 C .Q', etc.).
def func_1(a, b):
    x, y = a
    dx, dy = b
    return x + dx, y + dy
    #The program returns x which is part of a split, plus dx which is part of b split, and y which is part of a split, plus dy which is part of b split.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `a` and `b`, each containing two integers. It returns four integers: the first and second elements of tuple `a` added to the first and second elements of tuple `b`, respectively.
