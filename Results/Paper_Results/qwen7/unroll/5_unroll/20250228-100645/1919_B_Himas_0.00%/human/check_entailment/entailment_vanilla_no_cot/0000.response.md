Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`, which gives the net positive or negative sum of the array `a`. However, this approach does not account for the optimal way to split the array to minimize the penalty.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to consider the optimal way to split the array into segments such that the sum of penalties is minimized. The given solution simply computes the difference between the counts of '+' and '-', which does not necessarily lead to the minimum penalty.

Here's a more appropriate approach to solve the problem:

1. Iterate through the string and keep track of the current sum.
2. Whenever the current sum becomes zero, it means we can split the array at this point without increasing the penalty.
3. Calculate the penalty for the segment before the split and reset the current sum.
4. Continue this process until the end of the string.

This approach ensures that we are splitting the array optimally to minimize the penalty.
