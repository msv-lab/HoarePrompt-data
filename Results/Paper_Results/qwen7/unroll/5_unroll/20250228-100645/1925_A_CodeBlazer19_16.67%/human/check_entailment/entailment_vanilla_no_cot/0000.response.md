Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly generate a string `s` such that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. Here's why:

1. **Single Character Case**: For the case where `k == 1`, the current implementation prints `n * s`, which results in a string like "aaaa" when `k == 1` and `n == 4`. However, this does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` can be found as subsequences.

2. **Multiple Characters Case**: The logic for `k > 1` is flawed. The current implementation simply repeats the sequence of the first `k` characters `2 - (n == 1)` times. This does not guarantee that all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` characters will be subsequences of `s`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to construct a string that includes all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. One approach is to use a de Bruijn sequence, which is a cyclic sequence that contains every possible subsequence of a given length over a given alphabet.

Hereâ€™s an example of how to construct such a string using a de Bruijn sequence for the given constraints:

```python
from collections import deque

def de_bruijn(k, n):
    """Return the de Bruijn sequence for alphabet size k and subsequences of length n."""
    a = [0] * k * n
    sequence = []
    d, t, m = deque(), 0, 1

    def db(t, m):
        if t > m:
            if m == n:
                sequence.extend(a[1:m+1])
            d.append(a[m])
            db(t-1, m+1)
        else:
            a[t] = a[t-m]
            db(t+1, m)
            for j in range(a[t-m]+1, k):
                a[t] = j
                db(t+1, t+1)

    db(1, 1)
    i = 0
    while i < len(d):
        for j in range(k-1, -1, -1):
            if d[i] == j:
                sequence.append(chr(j + 97))
                break
        i += 1
    return ''.join(sequence)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        print(de_bruijn(k, n))

func()
```

This code constructs a de Bruijn sequence for the given `k` and `n`, ensuring that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters are included.
