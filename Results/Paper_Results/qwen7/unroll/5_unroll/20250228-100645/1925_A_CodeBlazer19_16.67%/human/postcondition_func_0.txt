The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 26 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq 26 \). For each test case, it generates a string consisting of \( k \) lowercase letters starting from 'a'. If \( k \) is 1, it prints the character 'a' repeated \( n \) times; otherwise, it prints the generated string repeated \( (2 - (n == 1)) \) times. The function outputs multiple strings, one for each test case, based on the given inputs.
