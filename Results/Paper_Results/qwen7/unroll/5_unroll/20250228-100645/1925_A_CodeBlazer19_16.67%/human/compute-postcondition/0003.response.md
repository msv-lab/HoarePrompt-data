Output State: The output state will consist of multiple strings printed based on the input values provided within the specified constraints. For each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `t`), the program reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input. It then generates a string `s` containing `k` lowercase letters starting from 'a'. If `k` is 1, it prints `n` times the character 'a'. Otherwise, it prints `(2 - (n == 1))` times the string `s`. The total number of strings printed will be equal to the value of `t`. Each string printed depends on the specific values of `n` and `k` for that iteration.
