Functionality: **The function processes an input string `inpstr` containing characters 'W' and 'B', identifying the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'B'. It then calculates and prints the length of the string minus these two indices, effectively returning the length of the substring between the first and last 'B' (if they exist). If no 'B' is found, the output will be the length of the string.**
