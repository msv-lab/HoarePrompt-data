Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `inpstr` is the input string which is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' represents a white cell and 'B' represents a black cell, and it is guaranteed that at least one cell in `inpstr` is black.**

Explanation: The code `inpstr = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `inpstr`. The initial conditions for `t` and the description of `s` (now referred to as `inpstr`) remain unchanged except that `inpstr` now holds the value of the input string.
