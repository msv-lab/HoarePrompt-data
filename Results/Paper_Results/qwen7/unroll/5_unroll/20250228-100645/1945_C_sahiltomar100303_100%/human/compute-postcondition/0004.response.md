Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and a string a of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'. For each test case, it returns a specific value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a test identifier `t`, an integer `n`, and a binary string `a`. The function processes these inputs and returns a result for each test case according to the specified conditions.
