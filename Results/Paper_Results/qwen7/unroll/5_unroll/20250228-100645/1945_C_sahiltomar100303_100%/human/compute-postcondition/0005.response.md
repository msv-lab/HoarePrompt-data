Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the number of zeros and ones in the first half and the second half of the string. It then determines and prints an index \( k \) (where \( 0 \leq k \leq n \)) that minimizes the difference between the count of zeros and ones when considering the substring starting from index \( k \) to the end of the string.**
