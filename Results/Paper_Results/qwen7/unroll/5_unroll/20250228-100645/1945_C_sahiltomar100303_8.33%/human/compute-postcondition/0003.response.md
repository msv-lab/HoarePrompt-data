Output State: The output will be an integer indicating the position `left` or `right` that minimizes the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's on either side of the split point in the string `s`. Specifically, it will print the index `left` if moving the split point to the left reduces the imbalance less than or equal to moving it to the right, and vice versa. If the string is perfectly balanced around the midpoint, it will print the midpoint index `mid`.
