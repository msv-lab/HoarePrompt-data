    #State: Output State: The output will be an integer indicating the position `left` or `right` that minimizes the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's on either side of the split point in the string `s`. Specifically, it will print the index `left` if moving the split point to the left reduces the imbalance less than or equal to moving it to the right, and vice versa. If the string is perfectly balanced around the midpoint, it will print the midpoint index `mid`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \), an integer \( n \), and a binary string \( s \) of length \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the optimal position to split the string into two parts such that the difference between the number of '0's and '1's in each part is minimized. The function then prints the index of the split position that achieves this minimum imbalance. If the string is perfectly balanced around the midpoint, it prints the midpoint index.
