Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `_`, but since it is a dummy variable (usually used for iteration), we don't need to adjust its state.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is given as an input integer and the constraints specify \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute if `t` is within this range.

3. **List the necessary states to be adjusted**: The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is `t` itself. It must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
