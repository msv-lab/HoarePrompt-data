Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer \( T \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( S \), and a list \( N \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it sorts the list \( N \) and then identifies the smallest number that appears exactly once or the second smallest number among those that appear exactly once, if such numbers exist. If no such number exists, it sets the result to -1. Finally, it prints the result for each test case.**
