Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Game Logic**: 
   - Alice always picks an element from `N` and appends it to `c`, then removes it from `N`.
   - Bob only removes an element from `N`.
   - The goal is to maximize the MEX of `c` for Alice and minimize it for Bob.

2. **Current Implementation**:
   - The program sorts the list `N` and then tries to find the smallest number that appears exactly once.
   - This approach does not account for the alternating turns between Alice and Bob.
   - It also does not consider the optimal strategy where Alice and Bob would play to achieve the desired MEX value.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - Alice will try to maximize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest missing non-negative integer is as large as possible.
   - Bob will try to minimize the MEX by ensuring that the smallest missing non-negative integer is as small as possible.
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice picking the smallest available unique number and Bob removing any number that does not affect the MEX directly.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Alice should pick the smallest unique number to ensure the MEX is maximized.
   - Bob should remove any number that does not affect the MEX directly, typically larger numbers.

Given these points, the current implementation does not reflect the optimal strategy for both players. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
