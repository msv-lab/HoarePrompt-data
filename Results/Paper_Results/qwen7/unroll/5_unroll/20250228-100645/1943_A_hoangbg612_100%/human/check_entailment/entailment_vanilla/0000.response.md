Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the game logic and computes the MEX of the array `c` optimally.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading and Sorting:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `T`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size `S` and the array `N`.
   - It sorts the array `N`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A variable `cur` is initialized to `-1`, which will keep track of the current smallest missing integer.
   - A dictionary `M` is used to count occurrences of each integer in `N`.

3. **Processing the Sorted Array:**
   - The program iterates through the sorted array `N` and updates the dictionary `M` and the variable `cur`:
     - If the current number `num` is greater than `cur`, it checks if `num` is more than `cur + 1`. If so, it increments `cur` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it updates the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.
     - If `num` is less than or equal to `cur`, it increments the count of `cur` in the dictionary `M`.

4. **Final MEX Calculation:**
   - If the sum of counts in `M` equals `S`, it increments `cur` by 1.
   - It creates a list `cnt` containing keys from `M` where the value is 1.
   - If there are at least two elements in `cnt`, it sets `cur` to the second element in `cnt`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the value of `cur`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Game Logic:**
  - The program aims to simulate the game where Alice and Bob pick elements from the array `a` and build the array `c` accordingly.
  - Alice picks any element, and Bob picks any remaining element, ensuring the game progresses optimally.

- **MEX Calculation:**
  - The program attempts to calculate the MEX of the array `c` by tracking the smallest missing integer.
  - However, the logic to update `cur` and handle the counts in `M` is flawed. Specifically:
    - The logic to increment `cur` and break out of the loop when `num > cur + 1` is incorrect.
    - The final MEX calculation is also incorrect because it doesn't properly handle the distribution of elements picked by Alice and Bob.

### Example Test Case Analysis

Let's consider the example test case:

```
3
4
0 0 1 1
4
0 1 2 3
2
1 1
```

#### Case 1: `0 0 1 1`
- Sorted array: `[0, 0, 1, 1]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- After processing, `cur` should be `2` (as explained in the problem statement).

#### Case 2: `0 1 2 3`
- Sorted array: `[0, 1, 2, 3]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- After processing, `cur` should be `1`.

#### Case 3: `1 1`
- Sorted array: `[1, 1]`
- `cur` starts at `-1`.
- After processing, `cur` should be `0`.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the MEX of the array `c` after the optimal game play. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: **False**
