Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic for determining the game's final score based on the optimal play of both players. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Alice and Bob's Moves**: 
   - Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, but the current implementation does not simulate Alice's optimal strategy.
   - Bob always picks the smallest available element from `a`, but the code does not simulate this behavior accurately.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of MEX**:
   - The code attempts to calculate the MEX by sorting the array and then iterating through it, but it does not properly simulate the game's turns and the resulting `c` array.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The problem requires simulating the game where both players play optimally. The current implementation does not simulate the game correctly and instead tries to deduce the result based on the sorted order of elements, which is not sufficient.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game's turns and keep track of the elements picked by Alice and Bob. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate Alice's and Bob's Turns**:
   - Alice should always pick the largest available element to maximize the MEX.
   - Bob should always pick the smallest available element to minimize the MEX.

2. **Track Picked Elements**:
   - Use two separate lists to track the elements picked by Alice and Bob.

3. **Calculate MEX**:
   - After all turns are completed, compute the MEX of the resulting `c` array.

Here’s a revised version of the function to correctly simulate the game:

```python
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        S = int(input())
        N = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Initialize sets to track picked elements
        alice_picks = set()
        bob_picks = set()
        
        i, j = 0, S-1
        
        # Alice's turn: pick the largest available element
        for _ in range(S):
            if N[i] > N[j]:
                alice_picks.add(N[i])
                i += 1
            else:
                bob_picks.add(N[j])
                j -= 1
        
        # Combine and sort the picked elements
        c = sorted(alice_picks | bob_picks)
        
        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in c:
            mex += 1
        
        print(mex)

func()
```

This approach ensures that both players play optimally and calculates the correct MEX at the end.
