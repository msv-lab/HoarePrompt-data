Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not solve the given problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not relate to the problem description at all. The problem requires distributing coins in such a way that the total amount bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome. However, the given functions are related to finding the least common multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers using the greatest common divisor (GCD), which is not relevant to the problem.

To illustrate, consider the following test case from the example:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  3 2 7
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  27 41 12 
  ```

- Actual Output (using the provided functions):
  The provided functions do not provide any output related to the problem, as they are not used in the context of the problem.

Since the provided code does not implement the required functionality, the correctness is **False**.
