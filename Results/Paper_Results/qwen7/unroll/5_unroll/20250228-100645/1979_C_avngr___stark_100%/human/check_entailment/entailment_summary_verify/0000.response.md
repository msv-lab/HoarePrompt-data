### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and its components to determine if it correctly solves the given problem.

1. **Problem Description Analysis:**
   - We need to distribute coins among \( n \) outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet is strictly less than the amount received back for any winning outcome.
   - Each outcome has a multiplier \( k_i \).
   - For any winning outcome \( i \), the total amount bet should be less than \( k_i \times \text{bet}_i \).

2. **Program Code Analysis:**
   - The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
   - `func_1` computes the absolute value of the product of two numbers divided by their GCD, which is essentially the LCM of the two numbers.
   - `func_2` computes the LCM of a list of numbers using `func_1`.

3. **Function Summaries:**
   - `func_2` returns the product of all elements in the list, not the LCM as suggested by the name. This is because the function iteratively applies `func_1` which computes the LCM of two numbers at a time, but the result is actually the product of all numbers.

4. **Relevance to the Problem:**
   - The problem requires finding a distribution of coins such that the total bet is strictly less than the amount received for any winning outcome.
   - The provided functions do not help in achieving this goal. Instead, they compute the product of all multipliers, which is irrelevant to the problem.

5. **Test Case Analysis:**
   - Consider the example test case:
     - Input:
       ```
       3
       3 2 7
       ```
     - Expected Output:
       ```
       27 41 12 
       ```
     - Actual Output (using the provided functions):
       - The provided functions do not produce any meaningful output related to the problem. They simply compute the product of all multipliers, which is not useful for solving the problem.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided functions do not solve the problem, and the program does not implement the required logic.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
