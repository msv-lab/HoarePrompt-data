### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not contribute to solving the problem as described. However, the conclusion that the correctness of the program is **False** is not entirely accurate because the core logic of the program is still correct, even though the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are unnecessary.

Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of outcomes `n` and the multipliers `k`.

2. **Computing the Total Bet:**
   - The program uses `func_2` to compute the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k`. This LCM is stored in `m`.
   - It then calculates the bets `c` for each outcome by dividing `m` by each `k_i`.

3. **Checking and Printing the Result:**
   - If the sum of the calculated bets `c` is greater than or equal to `m`, the program prints `-1` indicating that no valid distribution exists.
   - Otherwise, it prints the calculated bets `c`.

Given the problem constraints and the example outputs, the program correctly handles the logic of determining if a valid distribution of bets exists. The core logic of the program is sound, even though the use of `func_1` and `func_2` is unnecessary. 

However, since the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not required for the solution and do not affect the correctness of the program, we can simplify the program by removing these functions. The simplified version would directly calculate the LCM using a different method or simply use the minimum value of `k_i` as the bet for each outcome, which is a simpler and more efficient approach.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is partially correct in identifying that the provided functions are unnecessary, but it incorrectly concludes that the program is incorrect. The program is indeed correct, even with the unnecessary functions included.

**Final: True**

The program is correct based on the problem requirements and the provided example outputs.
