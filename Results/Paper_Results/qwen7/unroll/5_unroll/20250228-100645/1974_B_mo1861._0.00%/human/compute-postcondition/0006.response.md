Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `c`, which is iterating over the string `b`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `c`**: Since `c` is iterating over each character in the string `b`, the initial value of `c` will be the first character in the string `b`.

3. **Determine the State of `b`**: The string `b` is used as the iterable for the loop. The loop will execute once for each character in `b`.

4. **Initial State of `char_map` and `s`**: 
   - `char_map` is a dictionary mapping each unique character in `b` to a character starting from 'z' and going backwards based on the sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
   - `s` is an empty string.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the states of the objects involved in the loop head. Specifically, we need to ensure that `b` is not empty, and `c` is set to the first character in `b`.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning:

- The loop will execute if `b` is not an empty string.
- The variable `c` will take the value of the first character in `b` during the first iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `b` is not empty and `c` is set to the first character in `b`.

**State:**
- `b` must not be an empty string.
- `c` must be the first character in `b`.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`b` is a non-empty string, `c` is the first character in `b`**
