Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains three variables - `i`, `c`, and the tuple `(i, c)` which is derived from `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**:
   - `b` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
   - `char_map` is an empty dictionary.
   - `sorted(set(b))` creates a sorted list of unique characters from the string `b`.
   - `enumerate(sorted(set(b)))` creates a sequence of tuples where each tuple consists of an index `i` and a character `c` from the sorted unique characters of `b`.

3. **Determine the initial state adjustments needed**:
   - Since the loop iterates over the sorted unique characters of `b`, the variable `b` must contain at least one unique character for the loop to execute.
   - The variable `i` will start from 0 and increment with each iteration.
   - The variable `c` will be the first unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `b`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that `b` contains at least one unique character for the loop to execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `b` must contain at least one unique character.
- `i` will start from 0.
- `c` will be the first unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `b`.

Therefore, the final state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **`b` must contain at least one unique character, `i` is 0, `c` is the first unique character in the sorted list of unique characters from `b`**.
