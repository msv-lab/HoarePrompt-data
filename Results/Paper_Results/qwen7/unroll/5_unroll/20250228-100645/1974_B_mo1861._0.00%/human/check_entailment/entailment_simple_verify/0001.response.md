### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires decoding a string `b` back to the original string `s`. The encoding process involves creating an auxiliary string `r` with unique characters from `s` sorted alphabetically, and then replacing each character in `s` with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to decode the string `b`.
   - It creates a dictionary `char_map` where each character in the sorted unique set of `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`.
   - The mapping is done by calculating the position of each character in the sorted unique set and assigning it the corresponding symmetric character.
   - Finally, the function constructs the original string `s` by replacing each character in `b` with its mapped value from `char_map`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The function correctly identifies the unique characters in `b` and sorts them.
   - However, the mapping step in `func_1` is flawed. The function uses `chr(ord('a') + (len(b) - i - 1))` to map characters, which does not correctly reflect the symmetric mapping described in the problem statement.
   - For example, if `b = "serofedsoc"`, the unique characters sorted are `['c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'o', 'r', 's']`. The symmetric mapping should be:
     - 'c' -> 's'
     - 'd' -> 'r'
     - 'e' -> 'e'
     - 'f' -> 'f'
     - 'o' -> 'o'
     - 'r' -> 'd'
     - 's' -> 'c'
   - The current implementation maps these characters incorrectly. For instance, 'c' would be mapped to 's' (which is correct), but 'd' would be mapped to 'r' instead of 'r' being mapped to 'd'.

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - To correctly implement the symmetric mapping, we need to create a dictionary where each character in the sorted unique set is mapped to its symmetric counterpart.
   - We can achieve this by iterating through the sorted unique characters and mapping each character to its symmetric counterpart.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    for i in range(len(unique_chars)):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
    return s
```

### Annotated Code:
```python
def func_1(b):
    """
    Decode the given string b by restoring the original string s.

    Args:
        b (str): The encoded string.

    Returns:
        str: The decoded string s.
    """
    char_map = {}
    unique_chars = sorted(set(b))
    
    #State: Output State: `unique_chars` is a list of unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically.
    for i in range(len(unique_chars)):
        char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[-(i + 1)]
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`. The keys in the dictionary are the unique characters in `b` sorted alphabetically, and the values are characters from 'z' down to 'a' corresponding to the position of each character in the reversed sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
    s = ''
    for c in b:
        s += char_map[c]
        
    #State: Output State: `char_map` is a dictionary where each unique character in the string `b` is mapped to its symmetric character in `b`; `s` is the string constructed by concatenating the mapped characters for each character in `b` based on the `char_map`.
    return s
    #The program returns a string `s` where each character in the original string `b` is replaced by a corresponding character from 'z' to 'a' based on the reverse sorted order of unique characters in `b`.
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was inaccurate because the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly perform the symmetric mapping. The corrected implementation ensures that each character in `b` is mapped to its correct symmetric counterpart.

**Final: False**
