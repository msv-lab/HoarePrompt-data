arr is a list of two lists, where the first list contains integers representing the difficulties of the initial problems (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) sorted in non-decreasing order, and the second list contains integers representing the expected maximum difficulties (b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) also sorted in non-decreasing order. Both lists have the same length n, and 1 <= n <= 100.
