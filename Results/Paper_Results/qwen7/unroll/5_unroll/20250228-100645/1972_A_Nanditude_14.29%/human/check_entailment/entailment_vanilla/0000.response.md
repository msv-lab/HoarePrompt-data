Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We have two arrays `a` and `b`, both of length `n`.
- Each element `a_i` in `a` represents the current difficulty of the i-th problem.
- Each element `b_i` in `b` represents the maximum allowed difficulty for the i-th problem.
- We need to find the minimum number of new problems (each with a difficulty `w`) that we need to add to `a` to ensure `a_i \leq b_i` for all `i`.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from input, indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, `n`, `a`, and `b` are read and initialized.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - `cnt` is initialized to count the number of new problems added.
   - Two pointers `i` and `j` are used to traverse arrays `a` and `b` respectively.
   - A while loop runs until either `i` or `j` reaches the end of their respective arrays.
   - Inside the loop:
     - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means the current difficulty of the problem is higher than the expected difficulty.
       - A new problem with difficulty `b[j]` is added to `a` (by removing the last element and inserting `b[j]`).
       - `cnt` is incremented.
       - `j` is incremented to move to the next element in `b`.
     - Otherwise, `i` and `j` are both incremented to move to the next elements in `a` and `b`.

3. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function sorts the input array in descending order, which is not used in the main logic and seems irrelevant to solving the problem.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic correctly identifies when a new problem needs to be added.
- The insertion and sorting steps are handled appropriately.
- The loop ensures that all elements in `a` do not exceed their corresponding values in `b`.

### Example Verification:
- For the first example:
  - Initial `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`, `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`
  - After adding a problem with difficulty `800`, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200]`
  - After adding a problem with difficulty `1800`, `a` becomes `[800, 1000, 1400, 1800, 2000, 2000]`
  - The output is `2`, which matches the expected result.

- For the second example:
  - Initial `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`, `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - After adding problems with difficulties `1`, `2`, and `3`, `a` becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - The output is `3`, which matches the expected result.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

**Correctness: **True**
