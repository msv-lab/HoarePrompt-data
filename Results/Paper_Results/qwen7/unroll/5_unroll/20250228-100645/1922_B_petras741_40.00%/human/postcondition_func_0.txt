The function processes a series of test cases, each containing a positive integer \( t \) (number of test cases), a positive integer \( n \) (size of the list), and a list of non-negative integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a specific value based on the distribution of elements in the list \( a \). If \( n < 3 \), it prints 0. Otherwise, it computes a value related to combinations and sums of counts of distinct elements in \( a \).
