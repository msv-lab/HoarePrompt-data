Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of integers \( x \) and \( n \). For each test case, it calculates the maximum value among 1, \( i \), and \( x \) divided by \( i \), where \( i \) ranges from 1 (if \( x \) is even) to the largest odd number less than or equal to the square root of \( x \), provided that both \( i \) and \( x \) divided by \( i \) are less than or equal to \( k \) (where \( k \) is \( x \) divided by \( n \)). It prints the result for each test case.**
