Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the area of the square given the coordinates of its corners. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Coordinate Extraction**: For each test case, it reads four pairs of coordinates and stores them in a list `a`.
3. **X-coordinate Calculation**: It extracts the x-coordinates from the list of points and calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates (`dx`).
4. **Area Calculation**: The area of the square is calculated as `dx * dx`, which is correct because the side length of the square is the distance between the farthest left and right points (or equivalently, the farthest up and down points).

Given the constraints and the guarantees in the problem statement (that the points form a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes), this approach will always yield the correct area.
