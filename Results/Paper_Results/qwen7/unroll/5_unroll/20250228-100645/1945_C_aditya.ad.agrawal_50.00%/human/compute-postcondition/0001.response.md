Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `t`.
2. **Determine the current state**: Before the loop, `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
3. **Understand the loop requirement**: For the `while t` loop to execute at least once, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t > 0`).

Given that `t` is already assigned a value from user input and falls within the specified range, the only thing we need to ensure is that `t` is non-zero.

Since `t` is guaranteed to be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\), it is already non-zero. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary.

**Conclusion**: No state needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which is an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. The values of `n` and `a` remain as they were in the initial state.**
