Reasoning:
1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1(s)` which calculates the minimum cost to sort the binary string `s` in non-descending order using cyclic shifts.
2. The logic within `func_1(s)` iterates through the string `s` and accumulates the cost whenever a '0' is found after at least one '1'. This logic aligns with the problem statement where the cost is defined as the length of the substring chosen for the cyclic shift.
3. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1(s)` and printing the result.
4. The execution summary accurately describes how the function works, matching the logic in the code.

Based on this reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
