Output State: **`s` is a binary string (a string consisting of only '0's and/or '1's) with a length between 2 and 200000; `cost` is 0**.

The code initializes the variable `cost` to 0. Since the initial state of `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200000, and no operations are performed on `s`, its state remains unchanged. The variable `cost` is explicitly set to 0, so it is updated accordingly.
