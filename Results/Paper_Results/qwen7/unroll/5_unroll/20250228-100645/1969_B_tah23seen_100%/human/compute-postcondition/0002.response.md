Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is iterating over each character in the string `s`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Since `i` is iterating over each character in the string `s`, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to the first character of the string `s`.

3. **Determine the Length of `s`**: The string `s` is a binary string with a length between 2 and 200,000. For the loop to execute at least once, `s` must have at least one character.

4. **Initial Values of Other Variables**: The other variables `cost` and `one` are not directly involved in the loop head and their values do not affect the loop's execution based on the given information.

Given these points, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty binary string and `i` is set to the first character of `s`.

**Final State Adjustment**:
- `s` must be a non-empty binary string.
- `i` must be set to the first character of `s`.

So, the final state adjustment is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty binary string, `i` is the first character of `s`**
