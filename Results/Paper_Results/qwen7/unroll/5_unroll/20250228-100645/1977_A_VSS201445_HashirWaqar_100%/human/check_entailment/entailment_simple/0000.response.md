### Reasoning:

The provided Python program attempts to solve the problem by checking if it's possible to end up with exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. The logic used in the program is as follows:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case individually. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `n` (the total number of moves) is greater than or equal to `m` (the desired number of cubes) and if the difference `(n - m)` is even. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Output**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" for each test case based on the above condition.

Let's analyze the logic:

- **Condition `n >= m`**: This ensures that there are enough moves to potentially reach the desired number of cubes.
- **Condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0`**: This ensures that the difference between the total number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even. This is necessary because each move either adds or removes one cube, which means the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of cubes must match the parity of the number of moves added or removed.

Given these points, the logic correctly determines whether it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes after `n` moves.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Response:

Correctness: **True**
