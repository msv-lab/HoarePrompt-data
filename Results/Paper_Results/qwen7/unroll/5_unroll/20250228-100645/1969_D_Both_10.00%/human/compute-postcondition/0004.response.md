State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr`, `main_ar` is a list of tuples with each tuple containing two integers (a_i, b_i), `sec_arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents a value related to the optimization process, `val_b` must be the first element in `main_ar`**.

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `val_b` is used in the loop head, so its initial state must be set to the first element of `main_ar`.
- The other variables (`sub_summ` and `sec_arr`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.
- The list `main_ar` is a list of tuples, and each tuple contains two integers `(a_i, b_i)`. However, since `val_b` is used as an individual element from this list, the focus is on setting `val_b` to the first element of `main_ar`.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted such that `val_b` is initialized to the first element of `main_ar` for the loop to execute.
