Output State: **`sub_summ` is the sum of all elements in `sec_arr` where `val_b[0] + val_b[1]` is non-negative, `main_ar` is a list of tuples with each tuple containing two integers (a_i, b_i), and `sec_arr` is a list of integers where each integer represents a value related to the optimization process.**
