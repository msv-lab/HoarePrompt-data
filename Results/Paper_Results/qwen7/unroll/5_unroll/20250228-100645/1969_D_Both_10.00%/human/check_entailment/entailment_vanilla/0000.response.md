Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program uses custom functions `func_1` and `func_2` to read input.
   - `func_1` returns an integer value.
   - `func_2` returns a tuple of integers.
   - These functions are placeholders and do not perform actual input reading. This is a common pattern in competitive programming problems where custom I/O functions are used.

2. **Reading Input:**
   - The program should read the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it should read `n` and `k`.
   - It should then read two lists of integers: `a` and `b`.

3. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The core logic is missing in the provided code. The function `func_3` is defined but not called with the appropriate arguments.
   - The function `func_3` takes `main_ar` and `sec_arr` as arguments but these are not defined in the context of the problem.

4. **Core Logic:**
   - According to the problem, Alice needs to maximize her profit, and Bob needs to minimize it.
   - Alice should buy items such that her profit is maximized.
   - Bob will take either all items or `k` items for free, depending on the number of items Alice buys.
   - Alice's profit calculation involves comparing the sum of `b_i` (prices Bob pays) and the sum of `a_i` (prices Alice pays).

5. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - Alice should prioritize buying items with the highest difference `b_i - a_i` because this will maximize her profit.
   - If Alice buys more than `k` items, Bob will take `k` items for free, and Alice will need to account for the remaining items.

### Missing Code:
- The provided code does not implement the logic to find the optimal strategy for Alice.
- The function `func_3` is not correctly implemented and does not solve the problem.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not contain the necessary logic to solve the problem as described. Therefore, it is incorrect.

### Correctness:
**False**
