#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple lists and integers (n, k, a, b) associated with each test case, and returns an integer value generated by the function `putin()` for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `main_ar`, a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers representing prices for Alice and Bob, and `sec_arr`, a list of integers.
