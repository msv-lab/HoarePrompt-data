Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - The logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function reads two space-separated integers `n` and `k` for each test case.
   - It also reads `n` integers for `a` and `n` integers for `b`.
   - The logic is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

3. **Function 3 (`func_3`)**:
   - The function is supposed to calculate a sum based on the input arrays `main_ar` and `sec_arr`.
   - However, the function does not seem to correctly implement the logic required for the problem.
   - Specifically, the function should consider the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob to maximize and minimize Alice's profit, respectively.
   - The current implementation does not account for the strategic decisions of both players, such as Bob taking items for free or paying for them.

4. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The main program initializes several variables and structures to manage the items and their prices.
   - It sorts the items based on Bob's prices (`b_i`).
   - It uses a min-heap (`k_arr`) to keep track of the top `k` items that Bob might take for free.
   - The logic to update `sub_sum` and `max_value` appears to be attempting to simulate the optimal choices for both players.
   - However, the implementation of `func_3` is flawed and does not correctly reflect the strategic decisions needed.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation does not correctly handle the strategic aspects of the game. Therefore, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
