Output State: **`sub_summ` is 0, `main_ar` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers (a_i, b_i), representing the prices of items for Alice and Bob respectively, `sec_arr` is a list of integers, where each integer represents a value related to the optimization process but its exact meaning is not clear from the provided code snippet.**

Explanation: The code initializes `sub_summ` to 0. No changes are made to `main_ar` or `sec_arr`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state of these variables, with `sub_summ` being explicitly set to 0.
