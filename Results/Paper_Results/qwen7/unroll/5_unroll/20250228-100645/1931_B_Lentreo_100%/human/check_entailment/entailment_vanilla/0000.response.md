Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another where the source container index is less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: Since we can only pour water from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index, the final amount of water in each container must be the average amount of water per container. This is because any pouring operation can only redistribute the water but cannot change the total amount of water or the average amount of water per container.

3. **Sum Divisibility Check**: Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers \(n\), the average amount of water per container is an integer. This means that it is theoretically possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by \(n\).
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by \(n\), it returns 'NO'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by \(n\), it calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the containers and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount ever becomes negative. If it does, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution without violating the pouring rule.
   - If no such negative cumulative difference occurs, it returns 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by \(n\) correctly by returning 'NO'.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
