Output State: `n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `nums`, adding the difference between the current element and `mean` to `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. However, since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, and `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, it ensures that the sum of the differences between each element and `mean` will always be 0. Therefore, `curr` will never become less than 0, and the loop will complete without returning 'NO'. Thus, `curr` remains 0 after all iterations.
