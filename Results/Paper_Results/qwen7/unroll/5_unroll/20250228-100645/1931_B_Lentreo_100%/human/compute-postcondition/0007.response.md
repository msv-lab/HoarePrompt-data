Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0.**

Explanation: The line `curr = 0` initializes the variable `curr` to 0. No other changes are made to the existing variables `n`, `nums`, `total`, and `mean`. Therefore, their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
