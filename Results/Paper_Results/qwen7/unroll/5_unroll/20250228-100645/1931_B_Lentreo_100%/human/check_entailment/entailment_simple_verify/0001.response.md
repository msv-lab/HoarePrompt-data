### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal by pouring water from one container to another where the source container index is less than the destination container index.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the total amount of water must be divisible by the number of containers \(n\). This ensures that the average amount of water per container is an integer. However, the crucial part is to ensure that the redistribution can be done without violating the pouring rule (i.e., only pouring from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container).

3. **Sum Divisibility Check**: The code correctly checks if the total amount of water is divisible by \(n\). If it is not, it immediately returns 'NO'. This is a necessary condition but not sufficient on its own.

4. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by \(n\).
   - If the total amount of water is not divisible by \(n\), it returns 'NO'.
   - If the total amount of water is divisible by \(n\), it calculates the target amount of water per container (`mean`).
   - It then iterates through the containers and checks if the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount ever becomes negative. If it does, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution without violating the pouring rule.
   - If no such negative cumulative difference occurs, it returns 'YES'.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by \(n\) correctly by returning 'NO'.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the water can be evenly distributed by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

However, there is a subtle issue with the logic in the loop. The loop checks if the cumulative difference `curr` becomes negative, but it does not fully guarantee that the water can be redistributed according to the pouring rule. Specifically, the loop only checks the cumulative difference and does not ensure that the water can be poured from a lower-indexed container to a higher-indexed container in a way that maintains the order constraint.

To illustrate, consider the following example:
- Input: `n = 3`, `nums = [4, 5, 2]`
- Total water: `11`, which is divisible by `3` (average = `3.67`).
- The loop will check the cumulative difference, but it does not ensure that the water can be poured in the required order.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. While the sum divisibility check is necessary, the loop logic does not fully guarantee that the water can be redistributed according to the pouring rule. Therefore, the provided solution is not entirely correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
