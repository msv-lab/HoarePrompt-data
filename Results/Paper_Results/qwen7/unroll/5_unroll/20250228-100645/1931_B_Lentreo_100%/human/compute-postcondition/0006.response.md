Output State: **`n` is the length of `nums`, and the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, and `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the mean (average) of the elements in `nums` by performing integer division (`//`) of `total` by `n`. Since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, the result of the integer division is an integer. The value of `mean` is set to this integer result, while the values of `n` and `total` remain unchanged.
