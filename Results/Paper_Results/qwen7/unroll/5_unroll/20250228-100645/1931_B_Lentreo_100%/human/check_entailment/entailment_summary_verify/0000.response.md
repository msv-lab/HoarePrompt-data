### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies the key aspects of the program and explains why it works. Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - This part is handled correctly.

2. **Sum Divisibility Check**:
   - The program checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - This is a critical check because if the total sum is not divisible by `n`, it's impossible to distribute the water equally among all containers. The original assessment correctly notes this.

3. **Mean Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the mean amount of water each container should have (`mean = total // n`).
   - This is the target amount of water each container should have if the water is to be distributed equally. The original assessment correctly notes this.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - The program iterates through the list of water units and keeps a running balance of the difference between the current sum and the target sum.
   - If at any point the balance goes negative, it means it's impossible to achieve the target distribution, so it returns 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
   - This logic ensures that the cumulative difference between the current state and the target state does not go negative, which is necessary for the water to be distributed equally. The original assessment correctly notes this.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be distributed equally among the containers. There are no edge cases or logical errors in the provided code that would make it incorrect.
