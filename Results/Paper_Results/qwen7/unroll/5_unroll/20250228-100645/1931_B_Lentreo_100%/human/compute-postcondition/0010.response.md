Output State: `n` is the length of `nums`, the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`; `total` is the sum of the elements in `nums`, `mean` is the integer division of `total` by `n`, `curr` is 0.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each element in `nums`, updating `curr` by adding the difference between the current element and the mean to `curr`. If at any point `curr` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'NO'. However, since the sum of the elements in `nums` is divisible by `n`, and `curr` starts at 0, it will never go negative because each addition of `(nums[i] - mean)` will either keep `curr` at 0 or make it positive (since `nums[i] - mean` can be negative but the sum of these differences over all elements will balance out to 0 due to the divisibility condition). Therefore, the loop completes without returning 'NO', and `curr` remains 0.
