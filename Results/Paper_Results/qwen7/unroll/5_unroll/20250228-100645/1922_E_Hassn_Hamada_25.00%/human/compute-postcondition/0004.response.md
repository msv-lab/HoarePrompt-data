Output State: **`size` is 1, `number` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ number ≤ 1000, `sequence` is a list of integers where each element is within the range [-10^9, 10^9]**.

The variable `size` is explicitly set to 1. The values of `number` and `sequence` remain unchanged from their initial state, as no operations were performed on them in the given code snippet.
