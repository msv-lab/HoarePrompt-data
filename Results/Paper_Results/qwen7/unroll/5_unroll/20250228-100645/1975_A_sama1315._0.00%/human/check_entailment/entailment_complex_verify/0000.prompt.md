You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(arr):
    if all((arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))):
        return 'Yes'
    return 'No' if any((arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1))) else 'Yes'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        result = func_1(arr)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code:

    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of positive integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), where each element satisfies 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6.
def func_1(arr):
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) :
        return 'Yes'
        #The program returns 'Yes'
    #State: arr is a list of positive integers of length n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), where each element satisfies 1 ≤ arr_i ≤ 10^6, and there exists at least one index i such that arr[i] > arr[i + 1]
    return 'No' if any(arr[i] > arr[i + 1] for i in range(len(arr) - 1)) else 'Yes'
    #The program returns 'No' if there is no element in the list `arr` that is greater than the next element, otherwise it returns 'Yes'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `arr` and checks if there is at least one element in the list that is greater than the next element. If such an element exists, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and arr is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(arr)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 2 + 2t, `t` is the final value after all iterations, `n` is the last computed value of n, `arr` is the last computed list of integers, `results` is a list containing the results of `func_1` applied to each `arr`.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of func_1 applied to each element of arr, each result on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer `t` followed by `t` groups of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. For each group, it calls `func_1` with the list of integers and appends the result to a list. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order but does not account for the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation. 

Consider the following example:
- Input: `[1, 3, 2]`
- Expected Output: `Yes` (We can split the array into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`, and further split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, then swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`, and finally split `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]` which can be rearranged to `[1, 2, 3]`).

However, `func_1` would return `No` because it only checks if the array is already sorted, without considering the possibility of rearranging through the specified operation.

Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly and thus is incorrect.
