### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given problem and the provided program step-by-step.

#### Problem Analysis:
The goal is to determine if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting the array into two parts and swapping them. This means that for any array, we need to check if it can be rearranged into a non-decreasing sequence using the specified operation.

#### Function `func_1` Analysis:
- The function `func_1` checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
- If the array is already sorted, it returns 'Yes'.
- Otherwise, it returns 'No' if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements where the current element is greater than the next element.

However, this function does not consider the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation. It only checks if the array is already sorted, which is insufficient.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- It correctly handles reading the input and processing multiple test cases.

#### Example Consideration:
Consider the example provided in the original assessment:
- Input: `[1, 3, 2]`
- Expected Output: `Yes`

To achieve the expected output, the array can be rearranged as follows:
1. Split `[1, 3, 2]` into `[1]` and `[3, 2]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`.
2. Split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, then swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`.
3. Split `[2, 3]` into `[2]` and `[3]`, then swap them to get `[3, 2, 1]`.
4. Finally, split `[3, 2]` into `[3]` and `[2]`, then swap them to get `[2, 3, 1]`.

This sequence of operations can eventually sort the array to `[1, 2, 3]`.

#### Correctness of `func_1`:
- The function `func_1` only checks if the array is already sorted, which is not sufficient.
- It does not consider the possibility of rearranging the array through the specified operation.

#### Correctness of the Overall Program:
- The overall program correctly reads input and processes multiple test cases.
- However, the core logic in `func_1` is flawed and does not handle the required functionality.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required functionality.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
