Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer from data at index 0, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from the `data` list at index `index` (which is 0) to the variable `t`. The `index` is then incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
