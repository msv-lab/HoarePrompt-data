Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and `arr` is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^6 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**

The code `data = input().split()` reads a single line of input from `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
