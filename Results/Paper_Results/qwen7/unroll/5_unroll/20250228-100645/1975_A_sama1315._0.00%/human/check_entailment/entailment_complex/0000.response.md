Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function checks if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, it returns 'Yes'. Otherwise, it checks if there is any pair of consecutive elements where the first is greater than the second. If such a pair exists, it returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can potentially be sorted by splitting and swapping. If no such pair exists, it returns 'No'.
   - The logic here is flawed because the function should return 'No' if the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order and 'Yes' if it can be sorted by the described operation. However, the current implementation incorrectly returns 'Yes' when the array is not sorted in non-decreasing order but can still be sorted by the described operation.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly processes multiple test cases. It reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and collects the results.
   - However, the logic in `func_1` is incorrect, which means that `func_2` will produce incorrect results based on the flawed `func_1`.

Given that `func_1` has a logical error and will produce incorrect results, the overall program will also produce incorrect results. Therefore, the entire program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
