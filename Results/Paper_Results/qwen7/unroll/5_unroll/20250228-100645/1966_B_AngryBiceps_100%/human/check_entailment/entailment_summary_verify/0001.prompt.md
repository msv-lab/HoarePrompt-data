You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is an n \times m grid of white and black squares. In one operation, you
can select any two squares of the same color, and color all squares in the
subrectangle between them that color.

Formally, if you select positions (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) , both of which
are currently the same color c , set the color of all (x, y) where \min(x_1,
x_2) \le x \le \max(x_1, x_2) and \min(y_1, y_2) \le y \le \max(y_1, y_2) to c
.

This diagram shows a sequence of two possible operations on a grid:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/efe0d6bfa2062b4821f73fb07120103af504fb62.png)

Is it possible for all squares in the grid to be the same color, after
performing any number of operations (possibly zero)?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
500 ) — the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively.

Each of the next n lines contains m characters 'W' and 'B' — the initial
colors of the squares of the grid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n\cdot m over all test cases does not exceed
3\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to make all squares in the
grid the same color, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the
strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive
responses.

Note

In the first example, it is impossible to ever change the color of any square
with an operation, so we output NO.

The second example is the case pictured above. As shown in that diagram, it is
possible for all squares to be white after two operations, so we output YES.

In the third and fourth examples, all squares are already the same color, so
we output YES.

In the fifth example we can do everything in two operations. First, select
positions (2, 1) and (1, 4) and color all squares with 1 \le x \le 2 and 1 \le
y \le 4 to white. Then, select positions (2, 1) and (3, 4) and color all
squares with 2 \le x \le 3 and 1 \le y \le 4 to white. After these two
operations all squares are white.

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and len(set(a[-1])) == 1 and (a[0] != a[-1]):
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and len(set(last_row)) == 1 and (first_row != last_row):
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. It reads the number of test cases, n and m for each test case, and the grid itself. For each test case, it checks if the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if every row is identical and contains only one type of character but the first row is different from the last row. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions `n` and `m` of the grid.
   - It then reads `n` lines of input, storing each line in a list `a`.

2. **Extracting Rows:**
   - `first_row` is constructed by taking the first character of each row.
   - `last_row` is constructed by taking the last character of each row.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if the first row and the last row are different but both are uniform (all characters are the same).
     - If `a[0]` and `a[-1]` are different but both are uniform, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it proceeds to check the first and last columns.
   - The program checks if the first column and the last column are different but both are uniform.
     - If `first_row` and `last_row` are different but both are uniform, it prints "NO".
     - Otherwise, it prints "YES".

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Uniformity Check:**
   - The condition `len(set(a[0])) == 1` checks if the first row is uniform.
   - Similarly, `len(set(a[-1])) == 1` checks if the last row is uniform.
   - The condition `len(set(first_row)) == 1` checks if the first column is uniform.
   - Similarly, `len(set(last_row)) == 1` checks if the last column is uniform.

2. **Different Rows/Columns Check:**
   - The condition `a[0] != a[-1]` checks if the first and last rows are different.
   - The condition `first_row != last_row` checks if the first and last columns are different.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles the edge case where the grid is uniform (all rows or columns are the same) but does not handle the general case where the entire grid can be made uniform through operations.

### Example Verification

Let's verify the program with the provided examples:

- **Example 1:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    W
    B
    ```
  - Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The first and last rows are different, but they are not uniform, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

- **Example 2:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    WWWWBW
    WBWWWW
    BBBWWW
    BWWWBB
    WWBWBB
    BBBWBW
    ```
  - Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: The first and last rows are different, but they are uniform, so the program correctly outputs "NO". However, the program should output "YES" because the entire grid can be made uniform through operations.

- **Example 3:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    W
    ```
  - Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: The grid is already uniform, so the program correctly outputs "YES".

- **Example 4:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    BB
    BB
    ```
  - Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: The grid is already uniform, so the program correctly outputs "YES".

- **Example 5:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    BWBW
    WBWB
    BWBW
    ```
  - Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: The grid can be made uniform through operations, so the program correctly outputs "YES".

- **Example 6:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    WWWWBW
    WBWWWW
    BBBWWW
    BWWWBB
    WWBWBB
    BBBWBW
    ```
  - Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The first and last rows are different, but they are uniform, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

- **Example 7:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    BWBW
    WBWB
    BWBW
    ```
  - Output: "YES"
  - Explanation: The grid can be made uniform through operations, so the program correctly outputs "YES".

- **Example 8:**
  - Grid:
    ```
    WBBWB
    ```
  - Output: "NO"
  - Explanation: The grid cannot be made uniform through operations, so the program correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle the general case where the entire grid can be made uniform through operations. It only checks the first and last rows/columns, which is insufficient. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
