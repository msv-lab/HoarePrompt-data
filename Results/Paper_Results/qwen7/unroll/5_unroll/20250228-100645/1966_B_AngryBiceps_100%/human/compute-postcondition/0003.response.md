Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. Each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. The function also accepts a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function evaluates the grid and returns a result based on certain criteria (not specified in the given information).**

Note: The exact criteria for returning a result are not provided in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameters and their constraints.
