Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases. Specifically, the program checks only the first and last rows and columns to determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color. This approach is flawed because it does not consider the possibility of making all squares the same color through operations that involve intermediate rows and columns.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
3 3
BBW
WBB
BWB
```

According to the problem description, it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing the following operations:
1. Select positions (1, 1) and (3, 3), changing the subrectangle to `BBB`.
2. Select positions (1, 2) and (3, 2), changing the subrectangle to `BBB`.

However, the provided program would incorrectly output "NO" for this grid because the first and last rows and columns do not match. Therefore, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly.
