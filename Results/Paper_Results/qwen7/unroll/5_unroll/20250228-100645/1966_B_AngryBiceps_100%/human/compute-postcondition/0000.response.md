Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value used in the range function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as the input value (which is an integer) is greater than 0. Given that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), the loop will definitely execute because `t` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

3. **Adjust the State**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute based on the provided information.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts remains unchanged for the loop to execute.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Since no specific variables are being modified within the loop head, and the loop is guaranteed to execute based on the given constraints, the state does not need to be adjusted further.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**
