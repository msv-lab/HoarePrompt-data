The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n x m where each cell contains either 'W' or 'B'. It reads the number of test cases, n and m for each test case, and the grid itself. For each test case, it checks if the first row and the last row are identical and contain only one type of character ('W' or 'B'), or if every row is identical and contains only one type of character but the first row is different from the last row. If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
