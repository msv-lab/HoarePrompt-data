Output State: t is a positive integer, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5. The array a consists of n integers where 0 ≤ a_j ≤ 10^9 for each element a_j, and after executing the loop, if the conditions `b[-1] == 0` and `b[-2] == 0` are met for all elements in the array b, then the output will be 'YES' for that test case; otherwise, it will be 'NO'. The sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
