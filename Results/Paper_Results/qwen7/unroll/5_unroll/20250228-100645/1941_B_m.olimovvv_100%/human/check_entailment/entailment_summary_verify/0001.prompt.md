You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

    YES
    NO
    NO

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        for i in range(0, a - 2):
            if b[i] < 0:
                print('NO')
                break
            b[i + 1] -= b[i] * 2
            b[i + 2] -= b[i]
            b[i] -= b[i]
        else:
            if b[-1] != 0 or b[-2] != 0:
                print('NO')
            else:
                print('YES')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if certain conditions are met by modifying the array \( b \) derived from \( a \). If any condition fails, it prints 'NO'. If all conditions are met for all elements, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return a value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   
2. **Operation Simulation:**
   - The program iterates through the array from index `0` to `a-3` (since the operation is defined for indices `2 \le i \le n-1`).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if `b[i]` is negative. If it is, the program immediately prints 'NO' because a negative value indicates an invalid state.
   - It then updates the next two elements (`b[i+1]` and `b[i+2]`) according to the operation definition and sets `b[i]` to zero.
   
3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, the program checks if the last two elements of the array are non-zero. If they are, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Correctness Analysis

#### Test Case Validation:
- The program correctly identifies if any element becomes negative during the process, which would indicate an impossible scenario.
- However, there are some issues with how the operations are applied and the final check:

1. **Operation Application:**
   - The operation should be applied to the array such that the elements are reduced in a way that eventually leads to all elements being zero.
   - The current implementation subtracts `b[i] * 2` from `b[i+1]` and `b[i]` from `b[i+2]`, but it does not ensure that the operation can be applied repeatedly to achieve the goal of making all elements zero.

2. **Final Check:**
   - The final check only ensures that the last two elements are zero, but it does not guarantee that all elements have been reduced to zero.
   - The program does not handle cases where the initial configuration cannot be reduced to all zeros through the allowed operations.

#### Example Counter-Case:
Consider the array `[5, 6, 0, 2, 3, 0]`:
- The program will apply the operation at `i=2` (index 1 in 0-based indexing) and update the array to `[5, 4, 2, 2, 3, 0]`.
- Then, it will apply the operation at `i=3` and update the array to `[5, 4, 1, 0, 3, 0]`.
- Finally, it will apply the operation at `i=4` and update the array to `[5, 4, 1, 0, 1, 0]`.
- The program will then check the last two elements and print 'NO', which is incorrect because the array can actually be reduced to all zeros through the operations.

### Conclusion

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if all elements can be made zero. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
