The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) and an array \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, it checks if certain conditions are met by modifying the array \( b \) derived from \( a \). If any condition fails, it prints 'NO'. If all conditions are met for all elements, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return a value but prints 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
