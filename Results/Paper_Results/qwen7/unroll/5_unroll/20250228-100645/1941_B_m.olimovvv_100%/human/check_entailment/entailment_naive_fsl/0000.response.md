Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if any element in the array is negative after performing the operations and prints 'NO' immediately if it finds a negative element. However, this approach is flawed because it does not ensure that all elements can eventually be reduced to zero.

Consider the following test case:
```
5
2 4 4 5 1
```

The program will check each element in the array and subtract the required values as per the operation rules. However, the current implementation does not guarantee that all elements can be reduced to zero. For instance, in the given array `[2, 4, 4, 5, 1]`, the program will attempt to reduce the array but may fail to achieve the goal of making all elements zero due to the way the operations are applied.

A correct solution would involve checking if the sum of the array is even (since each operation reduces the sum by 3), and then verifying if the array can be manipulated to have all elements zero through the specified operations. The current implementation lacks these crucial checks and thus is incorrect.
