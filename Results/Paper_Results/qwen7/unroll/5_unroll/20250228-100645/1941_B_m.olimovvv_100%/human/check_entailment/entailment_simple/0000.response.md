### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to make all elements of an array zero by performing a specific operation. The operation involves selecting an index \(i\) (where \(2 \leq i \leq n-1\)) and decrementing the elements at indices \(i-1\), \(i\), and \(i+1\) by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array \(n\) and the array itself.
   - It then iterates through the array from index 0 to \(n-3\) (since the operation requires at least three elements).
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element \(b[i]\) is negative. If it is, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop, indicating that it's impossible to proceed with the operation.
   - If the current element is non-negative, it performs the specified operation: subtracts \(2 \times b[i]\) from \(b[i+1]\) and subtracts \(b[i]\) from \(b[i+2]\).
   - After the loop, it checks if the last two elements of the array are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly identifies when it's impossible to proceed (if any element becomes negative).
   - The operation performed in the loop is consistent with the problem statement.
   - The final check ensures that the last two elements are zero, which is necessary for making all elements zero.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It handles the conditions appropriately and produces the correct output based on the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
