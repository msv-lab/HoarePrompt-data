You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions specified in the loop body. For each input value of `t`, the program will process `n` characters from strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. If the processed template matches `a` and `b` but not `c`, it will print 'YES'; otherwise, it will print 'NO'. The final output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' results corresponding to each iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers t and n, and strings a, b, and c. It constructs a template based on the comparison between strings a and b. Then, it checks if the template matches a and b but does not match c. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final output consists of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Template Construction**: The program constructs a template by comparing characters of `a` and `b`. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, it appends `a[i]` to the template. Otherwise, it appends `a[i].upper()` to the template. This part is correct because it ensures that both `a` and `b` match the template.

2. **Matching `a` and `b` with Template**: The program checks if both `a` and `b` match the constructed template. It iterates through each character and ensures that:
   - If the template character is lowercase, both `a[i]` and `b[i]` must match.
   - If the template character is uppercase, neither `a[i]` nor `b[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template character.
   This logic is correct.

3. **Matching `c` with Template**: The program checks if `c` does not match the template. It iterates through each character and ensures that:
   - If the template character is lowercase, `c[i]` must not match.
   - If the template character is uppercase, `c[i]` should match the lowercase version of the template character.
   This logic is also correct.

4. **Output**: The program prints "YES" if `a` and `b` match the template and `c` does not, and "NO" otherwise. This is correct based on the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
