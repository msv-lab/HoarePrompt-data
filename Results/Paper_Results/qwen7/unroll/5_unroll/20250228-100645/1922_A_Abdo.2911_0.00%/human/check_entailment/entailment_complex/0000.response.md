Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the strings (`n`) and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. The program constructs a template based on the comparison between `a` and `b`:
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are the same, the template character is set to the same lowercase letter.
   - If the characters at the same position in `a` and `b` are different, the template character is set to the uppercase version of the character from `a`.
4. After constructing the template, the program checks if both `a` and `b` match the template:
   - For each character in the template, if it is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `a` and `b` matches the template character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `a` or `b` does not match the lowercase version of the template character.
5. Similarly, the program checks if `c` does not match the template:
   - For each character in the template, if it is lowercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` does not match the template character.
   - If the template character is uppercase, it checks if the corresponding character in `c` matches the lowercase version of the template character.
6. Based on these checks, the program prints 'YES' if `a` and `b` match the template but `c` does not, and 'NO' otherwise.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
