Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to find a valid permutation \( p \) based on the given array \( a \). The core issue lies in how the MEX value is being handled and assigned to the permutation \( p \).

Here's a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        p = [-1] * n
        
        # Initialize the set to keep track of used numbers
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(n):
            mex = 0
            while mex in used:
                mex += 1
            
            # Assign the MEX value minus the current a[i] to p[i]
            p[i] = mex - a[i]
            
            # Add the value to the used set
            used.add(p[i])
        
        print(*p)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Solution:
1. **Initialization**: We initialize a set `used` to keep track of the numbers that have already been assigned in the permutation \( p \).
2. **Iterate through the array \( a \)**: For each index \( i \), we calculate the MEX value by incrementing `mex` until we find a value that is not in the `used` set.
3. **Assign the MEX value**: We assign \( \text{MEX} - a[i] \) to \( p[i] \).
4. **Update the used set**: We add the value \( p[i] \) to the `used` set to mark it as used.
5. **Print the permutation \( p \)**: Finally, we print the constructed permutation \( p \).

This approach ensures that the permutation \( p \) is constructed correctly according to the given rules.
