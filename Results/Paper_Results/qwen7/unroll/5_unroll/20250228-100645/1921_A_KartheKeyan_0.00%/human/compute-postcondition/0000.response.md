Output State: **`n` is decreased by 1 after each iteration of the while loop, `s` is calculated as `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2` for each value of `l`, and the result is printed.**

Explanation:
- The code starts by taking an integer input `n`, which represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it takes an integer input `l`.
- It calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l-(4*(l//4)))//2`.
- It prints the value of `s`.
- After processing one test case, `n` is decremented by 1.
- This process repeats until `n` becomes 0.

Since the exact values of `x_i, y_i` are not used in the code and only `n` and `l` are relevant for the output state, the final state includes the updated value of `n` and the calculation and printing of `s` for each `l`.
