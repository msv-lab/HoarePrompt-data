Output State: The number of elements in `nums` list will vary based on the value of `k` for each test case. For each test case, `nums` will contain 5 elements: three fixed elements `[1, 2, 4, ..., 16777216]` (which are powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\)), the calculated element `k - nums[idx]`, and `k + 1`. After removing `1 << idx`, the list will have 5 elements. The exact values will depend on the specific values of `n` and `k` for each test case, but the length of `nums` will always be 5.
