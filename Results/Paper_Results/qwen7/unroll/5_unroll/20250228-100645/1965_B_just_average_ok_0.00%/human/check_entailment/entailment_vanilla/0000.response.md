Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.

2. **Generating Sequence:**
   - The program generates a list `nums` consisting of powers of 2 up to \(2^{23}\). This is done using the list comprehension `[1 << i for i in range(24)]`, which creates a list of integers from \(2^0\) to \(2^{23}\).
   - It then finds the index `idx` such that \(2^{\text{idx}}\) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`. This is done using the loop `while k >= 1 << idx: idx += 1;` followed by `idx -= 1`.
   - It removes this power of 2 from the list: `nums.remove(1 << idx)`.
   - It appends two new values to the list:
     - `k - nums[idx]`: This ensures that there is no subsequence summing to `k`.
     - `k + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + 1`.
     - `k + nums[idx] + 1`: This ensures that there is a subsequence summing to `k + nums[idx] + 1`.

3. **Output:**
   - The length of the list `nums` is printed.
   - The elements of the list `nums` are printed.

### Verification Against Problem Requirements:

1. **No Subsequence Summing to `k`:**
   - By removing \(2^{\text{idx}}\) and appending `k - nums[idx]`, the program ensures that no subsequence sums to `k`. This is because any subsequence that includes `k - nums[idx]` will have a sum that is less than `k` due to the removal of \(2^{\text{idx}}\).

2. **Subsequences Summing to All Values from 1 to `n` Except `k`:**
   - The list `nums` initially contains powers of 2, which can form any sum up to \(2^{23} - 1\). Removing one power of 2 and appending `k - nums[idx]` ensures that the remaining subsequences can still form all sums from 1 to `n` except `k`.
   - The additional values `k + 1` and `k + nums[idx] + 1` ensure that there are enough elements to form all required sums.

3. **Size Constraint:**
   - The list `nums` has at most 25 elements because it starts with 24 elements (powers of 2) and only three additional elements are appended.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to generate a sequence that meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
