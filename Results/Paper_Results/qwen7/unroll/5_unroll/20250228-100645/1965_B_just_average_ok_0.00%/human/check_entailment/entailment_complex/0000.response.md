Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires generating a sequence of at most 25 non-negative integers such that:
   - No subsequence sums to \( k \).
   - All integers from 1 to \( n \) (except \( k \)) can be represented as a subsequence sum.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution constructs a list `nums` with specific elements:
     - Three fixed elements: powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\).
     - A dynamically calculated element: \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \) where \( 2^{\text{idx}} \) is the largest power of 2 less than or equal to \( k \).
     - Two additional elements: \( k + 1 \) and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \).
   - One of the fixed elements (specifically \( 2^{\text{idx}} \)) is removed from the list.

3. **Verification**:
   - **No Subsequence Sums to \( k \)**:
     - By removing \( 2^{\text{idx}} \), any potential subsequence summing to \( k \) would require including \( 2^{\text{idx}} \), which is not possible since it is removed.
   - **All Integers from 1 to \( n \) (Except \( k \)) Can Be Represented**:
     - Powers of 2 up to \(2^{24}\) allow representing any sum up to \(2^{25} - 1\).
     - Using \( k - 2^{\text{idx}} \) and \( k + 1 \) ensures that \( k \) itself cannot be formed.
     - The additional elements \( k + 1 \) and \( k + 2^{\text{idx}} + 1 \) help in forming sums around \( k \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The constructed list meets both conditions specified in the problem statement.
   - The length of the list is always 5, which is within the allowed limit of 25.

Therefore, the given program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
