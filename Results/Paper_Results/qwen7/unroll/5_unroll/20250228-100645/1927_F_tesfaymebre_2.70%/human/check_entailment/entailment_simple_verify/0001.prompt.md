You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of vertices (`n`) and edges (`m`), and then reads the edges along with their weights.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - The graph is represented using an adjacency list (`graph`).
   - Edges are stored in a list `edges` with each entry being a tuple `(weight, u, v)`.

3. **Sorting Edges:**
   - The edges are sorted in descending order of their weights using `edges.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Disjoint Set Union (DSU):**
   - A DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is used to keep track of connected components and the minimum edge weight within each component.
   - The DSU is initialized with `n + 1` elements.

5. **Finding Minimum Weight Cycle:**
   - The program iterates over the sorted edges and uses the DSU to detect cycles.
   - If adding an edge creates a cycle, the program updates the minimum edge weight and stores the nodes involved in the cycle.
   - The minimum edge weight and the nodes forming the cycle are stored in variables `_min_edge`, `node_u`, and `node_v`.

6. **DFS Traversal:**
   - A DFS traversal is performed starting from `node_u` to find the cycle.
   - The `colors` array keeps track of the state of each node during the DFS.
   - The function `dfs` returns the path of the cycle when it finds a back edge to a previously visited node.

7. **Output:**
   - The program prints the minimum edge weight and the number of vertices in the cycle.
   - It also prints the vertices of the cycle in traversal order.

### Verification

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles multiple test cases correctly.
   - It correctly identifies cycles and ensures that the cycle is simple (no repeated vertices or edges).

2. **Correctness of DSU:**
   - The DSU implementation is correct for finding the minimum edge in a cycle.
   - The union-find operations are performed efficiently.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - The DFS traversal correctly identifies the cycle and ensures that the cycle is simple.

4. **Output Format:**
   - The output format matches the requirements specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct and follows the problem description accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
