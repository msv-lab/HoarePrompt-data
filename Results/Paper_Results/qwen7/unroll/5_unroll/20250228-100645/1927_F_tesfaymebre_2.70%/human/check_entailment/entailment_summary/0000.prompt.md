Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges. There is at
most one edge between each pair of vertices in the graph, and the graph does
not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not
necessarily connected.

A cycle in the graph is called simple if it doesn't pass through the same
vertex twice and doesn't contain the same edge twice.

Find any simple cycle in this graph in which the weight of the lightest edge
is minimal.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (3 \le n \le m
\le \min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5) ) — the size of the graph and
the number of edges.

The next m lines of the test case contain three integers u , v , and w (1 \le
u, v \le n , u \ne v , 1 \le w \le 10^6 ) — vertices u and v are connected by
an edge of weight w .

It is guaranteed that there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices.
Note that under the given constraints, there is always at least one simple
cycle in the graph.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of m for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a pair of numbers b and k , where:

  * b — the minimum weight of the edge in the found cycle, 
  * k — the number of vertices in the found cycle. 

On the next line, output k numbers from 1 to n — the vertices of the cycle in
traversal order.

Note that the answer always exists, as under the given constraints, there is
always at least one simple cycle in the graph.

 Output hints for function6:  The function processes a graph represented by a list of edges and a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure. It first constructs an adjacency list and a sorted list of edges. Then, it finds the minimum edge weight among the connected components using the DSU.

 Output hints for function7:  The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: an integer `curr` representing the current vertex being visited, an integer `parent` representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, and a list `path` representing the current path of vertices being traversed. It returns the current path of vertices being traversed during the DFS traversal or an empty list if no cycle is detected or other specific conditions are met.
Function number 8 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_7():
    test_cases = func_1()
    for _ in range(test_cases):
        func_6()
''' 

 Output hints for function8:  The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `m`, where `3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ \min(\lfloor n \cdot (n - 1)/2 \rfloor, 2 \cdot 10^5)`, and `m` represents the number of edges. Each edge is represented by three integers `u`, `v`, and `w`, where `1 ≤ u, v ≤ n`, `u ≠ v`, and `1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6`. The graph is guaranteed to have at least one simple cycle, and the sum of `m` across all test cases does not exceed `2 \cdot 10^5`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs information about the graph based on the given parameters. The final state of the program is that `test_cases` is set to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
