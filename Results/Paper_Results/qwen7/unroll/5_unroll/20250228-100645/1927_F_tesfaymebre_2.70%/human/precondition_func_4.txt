t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(\frac{n\cdot(n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5), representing the number of vertices and edges in the graph, respectively. The next m lines each contain three integers u, v, and w such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6, representing an edge between vertices u and v with weight w.
