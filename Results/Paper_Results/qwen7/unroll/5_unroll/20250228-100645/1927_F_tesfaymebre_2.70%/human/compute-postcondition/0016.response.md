Based on the initial state provided:

- `res` is the result of the DFS (Depth-First Search) starting from `node_u` excluding the parent node. This means `res` contains the nodes visited during the DFS traversal, excluding the parent of `node_u`.
- `colors` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros. This indicates that initially, all nodes have not been colored (or marked as visited).
- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among the connected components formed during the DFS process.
- `dsu` is a DSU (Disjoint Set Union) object with updated find and union operations based on the edges processed.
- `n` is the return value of `func_3()`. Since `func_3()` returns the same value for both `n` and `m`, `m` also holds this value.
- `graph` remains unchanged, meaning it retains its original state.
- `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a weight and a pair of connected nodes, sorted in descending order by weight.
- `node_v` is a node index.

The `print(*res)` statement will print the elements of the list `res` separated by spaces. Since the exact nodes in `res` are not specified, we can only describe them in terms of their relationship to `node_u`.

Output: **nodes visited during DFS from node_u excluding its parent (where nodes are the nodes visited in the DFS traversal excluding the parent of node_u)**
