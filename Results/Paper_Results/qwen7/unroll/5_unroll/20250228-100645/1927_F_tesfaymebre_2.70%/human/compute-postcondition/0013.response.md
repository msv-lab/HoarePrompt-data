Output State: **`colors` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros, `node_u` is a node index, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight among the connected components formed during the process, `dsu` is a DSU object with updated find and union operations based on the edges processed, `n` is the return value of `func_3()`, `m` is the return value of `func_3()`, `graph` remains unchanged, `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a weight and a pair of connected nodes (sorted in descending order by weight), `node_v` is a node index.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `colors` with a length of `n + 1` and fills it with zeros. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
