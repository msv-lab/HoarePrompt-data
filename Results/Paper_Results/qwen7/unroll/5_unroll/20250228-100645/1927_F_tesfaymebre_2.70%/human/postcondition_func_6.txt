The function `dfs` accepts three parameters: an integer `curr` representing the current vertex being visited, an integer `parent` representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, and a list `path` representing the current path of vertices being traversed. It returns the current path of vertices being traversed during the DFS traversal or an empty list if no cycle is detected or other specific conditions are met.
