Precondition: **test_cases is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 3 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ min(⌊n⋅(n - 1)/2⌋, 2 ⋅ 10^5), and m represents the number of edges. Each edge is represented by three integers u, v, and w, where 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v, and 1 ≤ w ≤ 10^6. The graph is guaranteed to have at least one simple cycle, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
