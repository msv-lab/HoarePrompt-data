Output State: **`curr` is an integer representing the current vertex being visited, `parent` is an integer representing the parent vertex of the current vertex in the DFS traversal, `path` is a list representing the current path of vertices being traversed with `curr` appended to it, and the color of the current vertex `curr` is now 2. The variable `res` contains a list of vertices forming a cycle if one is found during the DFS traversal, otherwise it is an empty list.**

Explanation: The line `colors[curr] = 2` changes the color of the current vertex `curr` to 2. This indicates that the vertex is being processed (it is in the "gray" or "discovered" state in graph theory terms). All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
