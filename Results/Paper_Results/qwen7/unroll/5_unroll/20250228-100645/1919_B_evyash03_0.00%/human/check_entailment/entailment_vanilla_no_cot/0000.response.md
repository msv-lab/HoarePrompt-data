Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty according to the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not implement the logic required to minimize the penalty as described. The current implementation of `func_1` counts the number of segments where the balance goes negative but does not compute the actual penalty based on the sum and length of these segments.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider how to split the array `a` into segments such that the sum of penalties is minimized. This involves evaluating different possible splits and choosing the one with the lowest total penalty. The current approach does not achieve this.
