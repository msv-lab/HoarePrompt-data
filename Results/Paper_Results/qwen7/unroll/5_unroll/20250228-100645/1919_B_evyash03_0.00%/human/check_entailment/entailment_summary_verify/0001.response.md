### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation. Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description and the function summary.

1. **Problem Description Recap**:
   - The goal is to minimize the penalty, which is the sum of the absolute values of the sums of the segments multiplied by their lengths.
   - The optimal strategy is to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero or as close to zero as possible.

2. **Function `func_1` Recap**:
   - The function iterates through each character in the `expression`.
   - It maintains a `balance` counter to keep track of the net sum of `+` and `-` characters.
   - If the `balance` becomes negative, it increments the `count` and resets the `balance` to zero.
   - Finally, it returns the `count` plus one if the `balance` is positive at the end.

3. **Correct Penalty Calculation**:
   - To achieve the minimum penalty, we need to split the array into segments where the sum of each segment is zero or as close to zero as possible.
   - The function should count the number of such splits needed to make the sum of each segment zero.

4. **Example Analysis**:
   - **Test Case 1**: `+`
     - Array: `[1]`
     - Optimal split: `([1])`
     - Penalty: \(1 \times 1 = 1\)
   - **Test Case 2**: `-----`
     - Array: `[-1, -1, -1, -1, -1]`
     - Optimal split: `([-1], [-1], [-1], [-1], [-1])`
     - Penalty: \(1 \times 5 = 5\)
   - **Test Case 3**: `+-+-+-`
     - Array: `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`
     - Optimal split: `([1, -1, 1, -1], [1, -1])`
     - Penalty: \(0 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 = 0\)
   - **Test Case 4**: `--+++++++-`
     - Array: `[-1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1]`
     - Optimal split: `([-1, -1], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1])`
     - Penalty: \(2 \times 2 + 0 \times 9 = 4\)
   - **Test Case 5**: `+---++++-+++++---++-`
     - Array: `[1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1]`
     - Optimal split: `([1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1])`
     - Penalty: \(0 \times 15 = 0\)

Given the function summary and the examples, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation. Instead, it counts the number of segments where the sum is negative and adds one if the final balance is positive, which is not the correct approach.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The program is **incorrect** because the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the penalty calculation.
