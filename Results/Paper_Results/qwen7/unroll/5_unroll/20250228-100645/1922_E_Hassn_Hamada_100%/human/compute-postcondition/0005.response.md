Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs from `max(sequence, default=0)` to `-1` in steps of `-1`. This means the loop will run as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `max(sequence, default=0)`.

3. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The initial value of `i` is given by `max(sequence, default=0)`. Since `size_overlap` is `(0, 0)`, it does not directly provide information about `sequence`. However, we know that `max(sequence, default=0)` will be the starting point of the loop.

4. **Adjust the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be initialized to `max(sequence, default=0)`. The value of `size_overlap` does not directly affect the loop initialization but is part of the program state.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `i`.

**State:**
**`size_overlap` is (0, 0), `i` is `max(sequence, default=0)`**
