Reasoning:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: The initial state of the program is provided with `number` being a positive integer such that \(1 \leq \text{number} \leq 1000\), and `sequence` being a list of integers where each element is within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\). However, the specific value of `sequence` is not provided, and it defaults to an empty list when not specified.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number`.
   - The function starts by checking if `number` is 0. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`. This part is correctly implemented.
   - The next part of the function involves a loop that iterates backward from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to 0. Since `sequence` is initially empty, `max(sequence, default=0)` is 0.
   - Inside the loop, the function calculates `size` and `value` using bitwise operations. The loop continues until the condition `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i) <= number` is satisfied.
   - If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, the function updates `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
   - The loop is expected to find the appropriate `size` and `overlap` values, but since `sequence` is empty, the loop does not execute any iterations, leaving `size_overlap` as `(0, 0)`.

3. **Recursive Call and Sequence Generation**:
   - After setting `size_overlap` to `(0, 0)`, the function enters another loop that appends values to `sequence` based on `size` and `overlap`.
   - Since `size` and `overlap` are both 0, this loop does not append any values to `sequence`.
   - The function then calls itself recursively with `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`, which simplifies to `number` since `size` and `overlap` are both 0.

4. **Recursive Termination**:
   - The recursive calls continue until `number` reaches 0, at which point the base case is hit, and the function returns `(0, 0)`.
   - The recursion eventually unwinds, and the final `sequence` generated is printed.

Given the analysis, the function logic seems to be correctly implemented to handle the generation of sequences based on the input `number`. The recursive nature of the function ensures that the correct sequence is built up step-by-step.

Correctness: **True**
