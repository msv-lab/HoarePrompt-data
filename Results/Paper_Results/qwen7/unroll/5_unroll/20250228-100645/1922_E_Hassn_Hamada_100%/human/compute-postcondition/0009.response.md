State: **`size` must be greater than 0 and `overlap` must be less than or equal to size**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(size - overlap):`.
2. For the `range()` function to generate at least one value (i.e., for the loop to execute at least once), the argument passed to it must be a non-negative integer.
3. The argument to `range()` here is `(size - overlap)`.
4. Therefore, `(size - overlap)` must be greater than or equal to 0.
5. This implies that `size` must be greater than or equal to `overlap`.
6. Since `size` is initially 0, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once, and `overlap` must be less than or equal to `size`.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are that `size` must be greater than 0 and `overlap` must be less than or equal to `size`.
