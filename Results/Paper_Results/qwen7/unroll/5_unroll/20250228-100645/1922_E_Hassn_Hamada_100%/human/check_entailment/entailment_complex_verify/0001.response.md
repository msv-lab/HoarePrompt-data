### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to generate an array of integers with a specified number of increasing subsequences, \(X\). The array length should not exceed 200, and all elements should be within the range \([-10^9, 10^9]\).

2. **Input and Output Format**:
   - The input consists of multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, we need to output either `-1` if no such array exists, or the length of the array followed by the array elements.

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to generate the sequence based on the input number.
   - The function uses bit manipulation to determine the structure of the sequence needed to achieve the desired number of increasing subsequences.

4. **Bit Manipulation Logic**:
   - The function iterates backward from the maximum possible value in the current sequence.
   - It calculates the size of the next segment (`size`) and its starting value (`value`).
   - It checks if the calculated `value` can fit into the remaining `number`.
   - If it fits, it updates the `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
   - It then appends the appropriate values to the sequence and recursively calls itself with the updated `number`.

5. **Main Loop**:
   - The main loop processes each test case.
   - It initializes an empty list `result` and calls `func_1` with `n-1` (since the function is designed to handle `n-1`).
   - It prints the length of the generated sequence and the sequence itself.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case when `number` is 0.
   - It ensures that the sequence is built correctly using bit manipulation and recursion.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: Before the function call, `number` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence` is an empty list.
- **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates backward from the maximum value in `sequence` (which is 0 initially) to 0. This means the loop will not execute any iterations since `sequence` starts as an empty list.
- **Size and Value Calculation**: The `size` and `value` calculations are based on bit manipulation. However, since the loop does not execute, `size_overlap` remains (0, 0).
- **Sequence Construction**: The sequence is constructed based on the `size_overlap` values. Since `size_overlap` is (0, 0), the sequence construction logic does not add any elements to the sequence.
- **Recursive Call**: The recursive call `func_1(number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap), sequence)` is made with `number` reduced by a value derived from `size` and `overlap`, but since `size` and `overlap` are both 0, this call does not change the sequence.

### Conclusion:

The provided program has a logical flaw in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the loop that is supposed to build the sequence does not execute because `sequence` is initialized as an empty list. As a result, the sequence is never properly constructed, leading to incorrect outputs.

### Final Answer:

Final: **False**
