### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its annotated version to evaluate the correctness of the program based on the given problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to generate an array of integers such that it has exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The program should output the length of the array and the array itself. If no such array exists, it should output `-1`.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Main Function (`__main__` Block):**
   - Reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, reads `X`.
   - Calls `func_1(X - 1, result)`.
   - Prints the length of the result and the result itself.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is supposed to generate a sequence of numbers based on the input `number` such that the resulting array has exactly `X` increasing subsequences.
   - The function uses a recursive approach to build the sequence.

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
- The function `func_1` starts by checking if `number` is zero. If so, it returns `(0, 0)`.
- If `number` is not zero, it initializes `size_overlap` to `(0, 0)` and then iterates backward from the maximum value in `sequence` (or 0 if `sequence` is empty).
- It calculates `size` and `value` using bitwise operations.
- It checks if the current `value` is less than or equal to `number`. If so, it updates `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop.
- After finding `size_overlap`, it appends elements to `sequence` based on the calculated `size` and `overlap`.
- Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes zero.

#### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of Increasing Subsequences:**
   - The function `func_1` does not correctly calculate the number of increasing subsequences. The bitwise operations and recursive calls do not align with the logic needed to generate the correct sequence.
   - The function assumes that the sequence generated will have the exact number of increasing subsequences, but this is not guaranteed by the current implementation.

2. **Recursive Calls and Sequence Generation:**
   - The recursive calls to `func_1` do not ensure that the sequence generated will have the exact number of increasing subsequences. The logic for updating `sequence` and the recursive calls are not aligned with the problem requirements.

3. **Test Case Verification:**
   - For `X = 2`, the correct output should be `[0]`, but the program might produce other sequences.
   - For `X = 5`, the correct output should be `[0, 1, 0]`, but the program might produce other sequences.
   - For `X = 37`, the correct output should be a specific sequence, but the program might produce other sequences.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly `X` increasing subsequences. The annotated code confirms that the function does not correctly handle the generation of the required sequence.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly generate the sequence of numbers to achieve the specified number of increasing subsequences for various values of `X`.
