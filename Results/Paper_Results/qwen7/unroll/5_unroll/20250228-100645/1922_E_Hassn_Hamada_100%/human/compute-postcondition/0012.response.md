Output State: **`size` is 0, `overlap` is 0, `sequence` is [], `number` is number - (1 << 0) + (1 << 0)**

Explanation: The function `func_1` is called with the argument `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`. Given the initial state where `size` is 0 and `overlap` is 0, the expression simplifies to `number - (1 << 0) + (1 << 0)`, which further simplifies to `number - 1 + 1`, resulting in the original `number`. The values of `size` and `overlap` remain unchanged, and the `sequence` list remains empty.
