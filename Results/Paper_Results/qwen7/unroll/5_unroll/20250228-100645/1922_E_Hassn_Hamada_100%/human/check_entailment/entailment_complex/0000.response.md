Reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
2. For each test case, it reads an integer \(X\) and attempts to generate an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences.
3. The core logic is contained within the `func_1` function, which is supposed to generate the sequence based on the input number.
4. The `func_1` function has issues with its logic and variable usage:
   - The initial check `if (number == 0) : return 0, 0` is problematic because it returns a tuple of zeros, which is not used in the function's logic.
   - The loop that calculates `size_overlap` is based on the maximum value in `sequence`, but `sequence` is not initialized before the loop starts, leading to undefined behavior.
   - The recursive call to `func_1` is made with `number - (1 << size) + (1 << overlap)`, which does not seem to correctly reduce the number of required increasing subsequences.
5. Given these issues, the function does not correctly generate sequences with the desired number of increasing subsequences.

Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to generate an array with exactly \(X\) increasing subsequences. The `func_1` function has logical errors and undefined behavior due to improper handling of the `sequence` list and the recursive call.
