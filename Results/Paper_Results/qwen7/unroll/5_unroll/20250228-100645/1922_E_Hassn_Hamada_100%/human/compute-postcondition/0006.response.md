Output State: size_overlap is (1, 0)

Explanation: The loop iterates from the maximum value in `sequence` down to 0. For each iteration, it calculates `size` and `value` based on the current value of `i`. The inner `while` loop increments `size` until `(1 << size + 1) - (1 << i)` exceeds `number`. If `value` is less than or equal to `number`, it updates `size_overlap` and breaks out of the loop. Given the default value of `max(sequence, default=0)` is 0, the loop starts at 0 and doesn't change due to the condition `i + 1`. Therefore, the final values are `size` as 1 and `i` as 0.
