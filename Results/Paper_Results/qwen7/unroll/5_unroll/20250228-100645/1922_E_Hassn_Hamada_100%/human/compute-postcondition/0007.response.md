Output State: size_overlap is (0, 0).

Explanation: The loop iterates over a range from `max(sequence, default=0)` down to 0. However, the initial state provided does not include the value of `sequence`, which is crucial for determining the start of the loop. Without knowing the value of `sequence`, we cannot determine the exact behavior of the loop. Given that the initial state of `size_overlap` is (0, 0), and assuming `sequence` is less than or equal to 0 (since it's the default value), the loop will not execute any iterations, leaving `size_overlap` unchanged at (0, 0).
