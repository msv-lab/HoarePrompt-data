The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `number`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence`, a list of integers. It generates a new sequence based on the input `number` and updates the `sequence` list. If `number` is 0, the function returns two zeros. Otherwise, it calculates a `size_overlap` pair and uses it to append elements to `sequence`. Finally, it recursively calls itself with updated parameters until `number` becomes 0, at which point it returns two zeros.
