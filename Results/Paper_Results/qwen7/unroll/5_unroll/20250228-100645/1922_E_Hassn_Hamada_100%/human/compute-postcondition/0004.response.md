Output State: **`size_overlap` is (0, 0)**

Explanation: The code initializes `size_overlap` to a tuple `(0, 0)`. This means that both elements of the tuple `size_overlap` are set to 0. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The precondition that `number` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `sequence` is a list of integers within the range of \([-10^9, 10^9]\) remains unchanged.
