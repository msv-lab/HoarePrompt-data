### Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function correctly updates the position of an object based on the direction provided ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R'). The logic is straightforward and ensures that the position is updated appropriately based on the direction.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - The function aims to handle the elimination of players when they are hit by a Bludger.
   - It iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players that are in the same position as a Bludger.
   - It appends these players to the `out` list.
   - It then prints the elimination message for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically.
   - The function sets the positions of the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]` in the `player` dictionary.

However, the original assessment is correct in pointing out that setting the positions to `[-1, -1]` might not be sufficient to ensure that these players are no longer considered active in the game. The main issue lies in the fact that the function does not explicitly remove the players from the `player` dictionary. This could potentially lead to incorrect behavior in the main program, as the players might still be considered active even though they have been eliminated.

### Evaluation:

- **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
  - Correctly updates the position based on the direction provided.
  
- **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
  - While it correctly identifies and prints the eliminated players, it does not fully remove them from the `player` dictionary. Setting the positions to `[-1, -1]` might not be enough to ensure they are no longer considered active in the game.

Given that the function does not remove the players from the `player` dictionary, the behavior of the main program could be incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
