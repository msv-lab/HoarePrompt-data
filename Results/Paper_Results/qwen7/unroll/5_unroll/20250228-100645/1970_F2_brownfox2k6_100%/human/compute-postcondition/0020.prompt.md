You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: obj is a list of two integers representing a position on the field, and d is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R').
def func_1(obj, d):
    if (d == 'U') :
        obj[0] -= 1
    else :
        if (d == 'D') :
            obj[0] += 1
        else :
            if (d == 'L') :
                obj[1] -= 1
            else :
                if (d == 'R') :
                    obj[1] += 1
                #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers where the second element is increased by 1, since the direction `d` is 'R' and there is no else part in the code.
            #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers, where the second element is either reduced by 1 if the direction `d` is 'L', or increased by 1 if the direction `d` is 'R'.
        #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers. If the direction `d` is 'D', the first element of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second element of `obj` is reduced by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second element of `obj` is increased by 1.
    #State: Postcondition: `obj` is a list of two integers. If the direction `d` is 'U', the first element of `obj` is decreased by 1. If `d` is 'D', the first element of `obj` is increased by 1. If `d` is 'L', the second element of `obj` is reduced by 1. If `d` is 'R', the second element of `obj` is increased by 1.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter `obj`, which is a list of two integers representing a position on the field, and a parameter `d`, which is a string representing the direction of movement ('U', 'D', 'L', or 'R'). Depending on the direction, it either moves up ('U'), down ('D'), left ('L'), or right ('R') from the given position and returns the new position as a list of two integers. If the direction is not one of the specified ones, it returns an error message.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
