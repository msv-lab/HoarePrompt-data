Reasoning:

1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function updates the position of an object based on the direction (`d`).
   - The function correctly adjusts the coordinates based on the direction provided ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R').

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function is intended to handle the elimination of players when a Bludger hits them.
   - The function iterates over the `player` dictionary to find players that are in the same position as a Bludger.
   - It appends these players to the `out` list.
   - It then prints the elimination message for each player in the `out` list, sorted alphabetically.
   - However, the function does not actually remove the players from the `player` dictionary. Instead, it sets their positions to `[-1, -1]`, which might not be sufficient to ensure they are no longer considered active in the game.

Given the problem description, the function should remove the players from the `player` dictionary to ensure they are no longer part of the game. The current implementation does not fully meet this requirement.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not correctly remove players from the game when they are hit by a Bludger. It only marks their positions as `[-1, -1]`, which may not be sufficient to ensure they are no longer considered active in the game. This could lead to incorrect behavior in the main program.
