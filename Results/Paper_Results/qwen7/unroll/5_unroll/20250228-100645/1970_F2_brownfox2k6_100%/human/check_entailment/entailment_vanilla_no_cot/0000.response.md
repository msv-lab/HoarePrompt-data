Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code snippets do not fully implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Specifically, the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are incomplete and do not handle all aspects of the problem requirements.

1. **Function `func_1`**: This function only handles movement for players. However, it does not handle catching or throwing the Quaffle. Additionally, it does not check if the player is moving into a valid position on the field or if they are carrying the Quaffle when performing certain actions.

2. **Function `func_2`**: This function is intended to eliminate players when they are hit by a Bludger. However, it does not correctly update the state of the game, such as removing the player from the field and updating their position. It also does not handle the scenario where multiple players can be eliminated simultaneously and prints the events in the correct order.

To fully implement the solution, additional functions and logic are required to handle:
- Player movements, including checking for valid moves.
- Catching and throwing the Quaffle.
- Updating the score when a player successfully scores.
- Handling the elimination of players due to Bludgers.
- Printing the correct events in the specified order.

Therefore, the provided code snippets are not sufficient to solve the problem correctly.
