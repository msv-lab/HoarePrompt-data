The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the current time step in the game. It also accepts a parameter `player`, which is a dictionary mapping player identifiers (strings like 'R0', 'B0') to their current positions (a list of two integers [x, y]). Additionally, it accepts a parameter `blud`, which is a list of players who are currently in the same position as a Bludger.

The function does not directly return a value based on the given output cases, but rather seems to process the current state of players and Bludgers at the given time step `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept the current time step `t`, a dictionary of player positions, and a list of players in the same position as a Bludger, and process this information according to the game's rules at the specified time step.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t` (current time step), a dictionary `player` mapping player identifiers to their positions, and a list `blud` of players in the same position as a Bludger, and processes this information according to the game's rules at the specified time step.**
