Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: This function correctly handles the movement of entities on the field based on the direction provided. It updates the position of the entity (player or ball) accordingly and ensures that the movement is within the bounds of the field.
2. **Function `func_2`**: This function correctly identifies players who are in the same position as a Bludger and marks them as eliminated. It prints the appropriate message and updates the player's position to `[-1, -1]`. The sorting of players before printing ensures that the elimination messages are printed in the correct order.
3. **Main Program Logic**:
   - The program correctly initializes the field and entities.
   - It processes each step of the game, updating the positions of the Quaffle and players based on the actions provided.
   - It correctly handles the scoring of goals and the elimination of players.
   - The final score is printed correctly at the end of the game.

Given the execution summaries and the logic of the program, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem description accurately.

Correctness: **True**
