Output State: The variable `out` will contain a list of player identifiers (strings like 'R0', 'B0') that were in the same position as a Bludger (`blud`) at each time step `t`, and these players will be printed with the message "ELIMINATED" along with the current time step `t`. The variable `t` will be incremented for each iteration of the loop, and the dictionary `player` will map the eliminated players to `[-1, -1]`. All players that were in the same position as a Bludger at any time step will be listed in `out` and printed as eliminated.
