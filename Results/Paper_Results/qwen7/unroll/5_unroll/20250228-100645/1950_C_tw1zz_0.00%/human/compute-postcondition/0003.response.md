Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1440) and a string `s` in the format "hh:mm". It returns information based on the time represented by `s` and the integer `t`.**

However, since the function definition itself does not accept any parameters (`def func():`), and based on the provided constraints, the function should accept two parameters: `t` (an integer between 1 and 1440) and `s` (a string representing a time in "hh:mm" format). Given the format requirement, the correct description would be:
