Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a time in the format "h1:mm AM/PM". The specific times printed will depend on the input provided during the loop executions. For each input "hh:mm", the code converts "hh" to the 12-hour format and appends "AM" or "PM" accordingly, then prints the result.
