Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. It splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The logic for converting the 24-hour format to the 12-hour format is implemented in a somewhat inefficient manner using multiple `if-elif` statements. However, this logic does cover all possible cases from 00 to 23.
4. The conversion logic correctly handles the transition between AM and PM at 12:00.
5. The program constructs the output string in the correct format and prints it.
6. Given that the input is guaranteed to be a valid 24-hour format time, the provided logic will always produce the correct 12-hour format time.

Since the program correctly handles all edge cases and produces the expected output for the given examples, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
