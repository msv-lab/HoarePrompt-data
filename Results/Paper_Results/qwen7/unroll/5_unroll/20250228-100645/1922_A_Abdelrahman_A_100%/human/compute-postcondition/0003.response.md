Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), it checks if the third string `c` contains any character that is not present in either of the strings `a` or `b`. If `c` contains any such character, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if `c` matches exactly with either `a` or `b`, and if so, it prints 'NO'. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES'. The final output state will be a list of 'YES' and 'NO' corresponding to each test case.
