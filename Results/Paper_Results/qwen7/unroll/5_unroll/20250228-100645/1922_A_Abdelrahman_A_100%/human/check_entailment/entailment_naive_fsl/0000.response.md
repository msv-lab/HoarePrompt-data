Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`. If `c` is equal to either `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO", which is incorrect according to the problem description.

Consider the following test case:

```
3
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- According to the problem description, we need to check if there exists a template `t` such that `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
- In this case, we can use the template "AB". Both `a` ("aa") and `b` ("bb") would match this template because their respective characters are the same as the template's characters. However, `c` ("ab") does not match the template "AB" because the second character of `c` is 'b' instead of 'B'.
- The program incorrectly prints "NO" because `c` is not exactly equal to `a` or `b`.

Therefore, the program does not handle the case where `a` and `b` can match a template while `c` does not, leading to incorrect results.
