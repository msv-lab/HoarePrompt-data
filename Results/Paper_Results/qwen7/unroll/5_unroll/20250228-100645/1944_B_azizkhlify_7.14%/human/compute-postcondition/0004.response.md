Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (the number of test cases), \( n \) (the size of the array divided by 2), \( k \) (an integer constraint), and an array \( a \) of length \( 2n \) where each integer from 1 to \( n \) appears exactly twice. For each test case, it prints pairs of integers from \( a \) that appear exactly twice, up to \( k \) pairs. Then, it prints up to \( k \) single integers that appear once. Finally, it prints any remaining single integers. If the count of pairs does not match the count of single integers, it continues printing pairs until they match.**
