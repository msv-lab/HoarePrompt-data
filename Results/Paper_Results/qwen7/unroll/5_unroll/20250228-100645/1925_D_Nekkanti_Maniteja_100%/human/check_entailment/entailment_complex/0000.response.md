Reasoning:

1. **Test Case Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by iterating `t` times, which is the number of test cases.
2. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values `n`, `m`, and `k` for each test case.
3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: The program calculates the modular inverse `c` of \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is necessary because the number of possible pairs of children is \(\frac{n(n-1)}{2}\), and we need the modular inverse for later calculations.
4. **Sum Initialization**: The variable `a` is initialized to 0 and used to accumulate the sum of the friendship values `f_i`.
5. **Main Calculation Loop**: The main loop iterates `k` times, updating the sum `s` according to the given formula: \( s = s + c \cdot i \cdot c \cdot m + c \cdot a \). This formula is derived from the expected value calculation for the friendship values.
6. **Output**: The result `s` is printed modulo \(10^9 + 7\), which is the required output format.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic and steps taken in the program are consistent with the requirements. The program correctly implements the solution to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values for all k pairs chosen for the excursions.

Correctness: **True**
