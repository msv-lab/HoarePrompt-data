Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `m` and the array itself.
   - This part seems correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Sorting Check Logic**:
   - The program iterates from the end of the array to the beginning.
   - It checks if the current element (`arr[i]`) is less than the previous element (`arr[i - 1]`).
   - If it finds such a pair, it converts the larger element into its digit form and checks if the resulting list of digits is sorted.
   - If the list of digits is not sorted, it sets `ans` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If the list of digits is sorted, it updates `arr[i - 1]` with the first digit of the converted number.
   - This logic seems to follow the problem's requirement of splitting elements greater than or equal to 10 and checking if sorting is possible.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all elements, it prints "NO" if `ans` is `False`, otherwise it prints "YES".
   - This output logic also matches the problem statement.

### Edge Cases and Special Considerations:
- The program handles the conversion of numbers to their digit form correctly.
- It checks if the resulting digits are sorted, which is necessary to ensure the array can be sorted.
- The program correctly updates the array when a valid split is found.
- The program handles the case where the array might already be sorted without needing any operations.

### Testing the Program:
Given the example provided:
- For `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the program should output "YES" because after splitting, it becomes `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 67]` and can be sorted.
- For `[12, 28, 5]`, the program should output "NO" because no sequence of splits can sort the array.
- For `[0, 0]`, the program should output "YES" because the array is already sorted.

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to correctly implement the required functionality and handle the given examples appropriately.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
