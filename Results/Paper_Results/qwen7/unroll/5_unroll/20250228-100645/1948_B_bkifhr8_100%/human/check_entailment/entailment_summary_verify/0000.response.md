### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the given test cases.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine if it is possible to transform the array \(a\) into a non-decreasing order using the operation of splitting any element into its digits and inserting those digits back into the array.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        m = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        ans = True
        for i in range(m - 1, 0, -1):
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                nums = [int(i) for i in str(arr[i - 1])] + [arr[i]]
                if nums != sorted(nums):
                    ans = False
                    break
                arr[i - 1] = nums[0]
        print(['NO', 'YES'][ans])
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \(n\) followed by \(n\) integers.
- For each test case, it checks if the list of integers can be transformed by swapping adjacent elements to ensure the first element of each pair is non-decreasing.
- If possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Test Case 1:**
   - Input:
     ```
     4
     12 3 45 67
     ```
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The array can be transformed to `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` by splitting `12`, `45`, and `67`.

2. **Test Case 2:**
   - Input:
     ```
     3
     12 28 5
     ```
   - Expected Output: `NO`
   - Explanation: There is no way to transform `[12, 28, 5]` into a non-decreasing order using the given operations.

3. **Test Case 3:**
   - Input:
     ```
     2
     0 0
     ```
   - Expected Output: `YES`
   - Explanation: The array is already sorted.

#### Issues with the Provided Program:
- The program incorrectly assumes that the array can be sorted by simply checking if the current element is less than the previous element and then attempting to sort the digits of the previous element.
- The logic for checking and sorting the digits is flawed because it does not account for the possibility of multiple splits and the resulting order.

#### Correct Approach:
- The correct approach involves recursively checking if the array can be split and rearranged to form a non-decreasing sequence.
- This requires a more complex algorithm that considers all possible splits and permutations of the digits.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the array can be sorted using the specified operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
