Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Checking Sorted Order**: The logic to check if it's possible to sort the array using the given operations is flawed. The current implementation checks if the elements can be rearranged into a sorted list but does not correctly simulate the process of breaking down numbers and reinserting their digits.

2. **Misinterpretation of Operations**: The program attempts to check if the elements can be rearranged into a sorted list by comparing adjacent elements and checking if they can be broken down and reinserted in a sorted manner. However, this does not accurately reflect the operation described in the problem statement.

3. **Breaking Down and Reinserting Digits**: The program does not correctly simulate the process of breaking down a number into its digits and reinserting them. It only checks if the resulting list after breaking down and reinserting is sorted, which is not sufficient.

4. **Handling Test Cases**: The program reads multiple test cases but does not handle them correctly. It should read each test case separately and determine if it can be sorted according to the rules.

### Correct Solution Outline:
To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the process of breaking down and reinserting digits until the array is sorted or determine that it is impossible to do so. Here is a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate the Operation**: For each number, break it down into its digits and reinsert them.
2. **Check Sorted Order**: After each operation, check if the array is sorted.
3. **Repeat Until Sorted or Impossible**: Continue the process until the array is sorted or it becomes clear that sorting is impossible.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_sort_array(arr):
    while True:
        sorted_arr = sorted(arr)
        if arr == sorted_arr:
            return True
        changed = False
        for i in range(len(arr)):
            num = arr[i]
            if num >= 10:
                digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
                new_num = int(''.join(map(str, digits)))
                if new_num < arr[i-1]:
                    return False
                arr[i] = new_num
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            return False

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if can_sort_array(arr):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This solution correctly simulates the process of breaking down and reinserting digits and checks if the array can be sorted according to the given rules.
