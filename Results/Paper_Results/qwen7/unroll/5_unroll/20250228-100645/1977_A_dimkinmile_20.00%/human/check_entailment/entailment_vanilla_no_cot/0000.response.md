Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required for the problem. Specifically, the program always calls `func_1()` without passing any arguments, which leads to an error because `func_1()` expects two integer inputs but receives none. To fix this, the program should pass the inputs received from `input()` to `func_1()`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
kreker = int(input())
for i in range(kreker):
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    func_1(n, m)

def func_1(n, m):
    if n >= m:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that `func_1` receives the necessary inputs and performs the correct checks to determine if it's possible to have `m` cubes after `n` moves.
