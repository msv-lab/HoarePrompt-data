Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
- `n` is an input integer.
- `m` is an input integer.
- The current value of `n` is greater than or equal to `m`.

The code snippet to be executed is:
```python
print('Yes')
```

The `print` statement outputs the string `'Yes'` regardless of the values of `t`, `n`, and `m`.

Output: **Yes**
