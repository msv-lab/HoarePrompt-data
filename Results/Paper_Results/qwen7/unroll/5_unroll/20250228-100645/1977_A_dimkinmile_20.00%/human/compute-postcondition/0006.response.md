Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), and for each test case, two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of n and m.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values for n and m are not specified in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the parameter constraints and the nature of the input and output without detailing the specific return values or conditions.
