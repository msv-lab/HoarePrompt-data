Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and the variable `t`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute for each value of `_` in the range from `0` to `t-1`. Therefore, the loop will execute `t` times.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is valid according to the given constraints. The state before the loop starts is that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).

Given this, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final State Adjustment**:
State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
