Output State: The output state consists of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case, depending on whether the cumulative sum of non-zero numbers in the list equals zero after processing all elements in the list. For each test case, it checks if the sum of differences between each element (except the last one) and the last element is zero; if it is, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
