### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary against the problem description and the example given.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
- The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function reads multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the cumulative sum of the differences between each non-zero element (excluding the last one) and the last element in the list.
- If this cumulative sum equals zero, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```

The program calculates the sum of differences as follows:
- Difference between 4 and 3: 1
- Difference between 5 and 3: 2
- Difference between 2 and 3: 1
- Difference between 1 and 3: 2

Sum of differences: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6

Since the sum is not zero, the program outputs "NO", which is incorrect. However, the correct approach should be to check if the average amount of water per container can be achieved by pouring water appropriately.

#### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we should check if the average amount of water per container can be achieved. This can be done by calculating the total amount of water and dividing it by the number of containers. If the result is an integer, it means the water can be evenly distributed among all containers.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        total_water = sum(nums)
        avg_water = total_water // n
        
        # Check if the total water is divisible by n
        if total_water % n == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Evaluation:
- The original program incorrectly uses the sum of differences to determine if the water can be evenly distributed.
- The corrected program checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, which is the correct approach.

Given the analysis, the original assessment was accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

### Final:
**False**
