Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition for `t` is that it is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4. After executing this line, `t` retains its original properties, and for each subsequent test case, `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 2 \cdot 10^5. The specific value of `n` for the current test case is yet to be read and will be determined in the next input.
