### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements of the problem.

#### Problem Requirements:
1. We need to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.
2. The sum of water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers \(n\).
3. The program should output "YES" if it is possible to make all containers have the same amount of water, and "NO" otherwise.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        nums = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        last = nums[-1]
        curr = 0
        for i in nums:
            if i != 0:
                curr += i - last
        if curr == 0:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

#### Annotated Code Explanation:
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it reads the number of containers `n` and the list of water amounts `nums`.
- It sets `last` to the last element in `nums`.
- It initializes `curr` to 0.
- It iterates through each element in `nums`, adding the difference between the current element and `last` to `curr` if the current element is non-zero.
- If `curr` is 0, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

#### Analysis:
1. **Sum of Differences Calculation**: The program calculates the sum of differences between each element (except the last one) and the last element. This is not a valid approach to solve the problem.
2. **Correct Approach**: To solve this problem, we need to check if the total amount of water can be evenly distributed among the containers. This can be done by checking if the average amount of water per container is an integer.
3. **Correct Solution**: A correct solution would involve:
   - Calculating the total amount of water.
   - Dividing the total amount by the number of containers to get the target amount of water per container.
   - Checking if the total amount is divisible by `n` and if each container can reach this target amount by pouring water from higher to lower amounts.

#### Example Test Case:
Consider the input:
```
5
4 5 2 1 3
```

- Total water: \(4 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 15\)
- Average water per container: \(15 / 5 = 3\)

We can achieve this by pouring water appropriately:
- Pour 1 unit from the first container to the fourth.
- Pour 1 unit from the second container to the third.

This makes all containers have 3 units of water each.

#### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
