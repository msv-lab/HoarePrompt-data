Based on the initial state provided, there are no variables or objects whose values are explicitly stated. The only information given is about the constraints on the variables `t` and `n`, and the values of the integers `a_i` in each test case. However, the print statement itself does not depend on any of these variables or their values; it simply prints a string.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be:

Output: **-----------------**
