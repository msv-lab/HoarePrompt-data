Output State: **`prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [0, 0].**

Explanation: The code initializes a 2D list `pre` with 32 sublists, each containing `[0, 0]`. This does not affect the values of `prefix`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables remain unchanged. The only new information is about the initialized `pre` list.
