Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the cumulative XOR of the integers up to each point and then counts the occurrences of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of these cumulative XOR values. Finally, it computes a result based on these counts and prints the total sum. The function does not return any value but prints the final result.**
