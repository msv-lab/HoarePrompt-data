Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) per test case indicating the number of integers in the subsequent line, and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given conditions.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer t indicating the number of sub-cases, an integer n indicating the number of integers in the next line, and n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The function processes these inputs and returns results accordingly.
