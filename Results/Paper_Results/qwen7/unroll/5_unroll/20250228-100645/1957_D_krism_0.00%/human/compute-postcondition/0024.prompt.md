You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.

    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0. `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged.
    print(arr, prefix)
    #This is printed: [arr], [0, arr[0], arr[0] ^ arr[1], arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ arr[2], ..., arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[n-1]]
    pre = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    suf = [[0, 0] for _ in range(32)]
    for i in range(32):
        pre[i][0] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [1, 0]; `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [0, 0].
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        cur = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):

    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing [1, 0]; `suf` is a list of 32 lists, where each list contains the count of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values from `prefix`. Specifically, for each index `j` in `suf`, `suf[j][1]` contains the total number of times the `j`-th bit (from the right) is 1 across all elements in `prefix`, and `suf[j][0]` contains the total number of times the `j`-th bit is 0.

        y = arr[i - 1]
        
        k = y.bit_length() - 1
        
        ans += pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]
        
        c = prefix[i]
        
        for j in range(32):
            if c >> j & 1:
                pre[j][1] += 1

    #State: Output State: `prefix` is a list where each element is the cumulative XOR of all elements in `arr` up to that point, starting with 0; `t` remains unchanged, and `n` remains unchanged; `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing the count of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values from `prefix`; `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing the count of 1s and 0s in the binary representation of the cumulative XOR values from `prefix`; `ans` is the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for each bit position `k` from 0 to 31 after all iterations of the loop.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][0] for each bit position k from 0 to 31)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) per test case indicating the number of integers in the subsequent line, and then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given conditions.

The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
