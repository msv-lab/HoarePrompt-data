Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program checks if for every position `i` from 0 to `n-1`, the characters in `a[i]` and `b[i]` both match the character in `c[i]`. This is the opposite of what the problem requires. The problem asks for a template where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. Therefore, the program should check if there exists at least one position where `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`, while ensuring that `a[i]` and `b[i]` match for all positions.

The program should set `l` to 'YES' if there exists at least one position where `a[i]` or `b[i]` does not match `c[i]`, and set `l` to 'NO' otherwise. However, the current implementation sets `l` to 'YES' only if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` match `c[i]` for all positions, which is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
