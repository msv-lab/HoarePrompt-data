Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. **Logic Error**: The current implementation checks if both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different from `c[i]`. This does not guarantee that a suitable template can be found where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not. Instead, we need to check if there is any character in `c` that would disqualify `a` or `b` from matching a potential template.

2. **Template Construction**: The program should attempt to construct a template character by character, ensuring that for each position `i`, either `a[i]` and `b[i]` can match the template (if the template character is lowercase) or `c[i]` does not match the template (if the template character is uppercase).

3. **Correct Approach**: We need to iterate through each character and decide whether to make it lowercase or uppercase based on the characters in `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()

        # Create a template based on the characters of a, b, and c
        template = []
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                template.append(c[i].swapcase())
            else:
                template.append('?')  # '?' indicates a wildcard that can be either lower or upper case

        # Check if the template allows a and b to match but not c
        valid_template = True
        for i in range(n):
            if template[i] != '?':
                if a[i] != template[i] or b[i] != template[i]:
                    valid_template = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == c[i] or b[i] == c[i]:
                valid_template = False
                break

        if valid_template:
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")

func()
```

This corrected version constructs a template and checks if it allows `a` and `b` to match but not `c`.
