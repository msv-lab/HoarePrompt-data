Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `l` is either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions inside the loop, `n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `b` remains unchanged, `c` remains unchanged.

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `l` will be set to 'YES' if for every index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, either `a[i]` is equal to `c[i]` or `b[i]` is equal to `c[i]`. Otherwise, `l` will be set to 'NO'. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
