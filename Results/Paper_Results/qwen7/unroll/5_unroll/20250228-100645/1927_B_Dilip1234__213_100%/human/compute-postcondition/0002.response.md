State: **`s` is an empty string, `char_count` is a list of 26 zeros, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range defined by `n`. The loop starts with `i` being 0 (the default starting value for `range(n)`).
3. Therefore, `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
4. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `i` should be less than `n`. Hence, `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `n` must be greater than 0.
