Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **String Construction Logic**: 
   - For each character position `i`, the program iterates through possible characters ('a' to 'z') and checks if the current count of occurrences matches the value at `a[i]`.
   - When a match is found, the corresponding character is appended to the string `s`, and the count for that character is incremented.
3. **Guaranteed Validity**: The problem guarantees that for each test case, a valid string can be constructed, so the logic will always produce a result.

The provided example outputs match the expected results, confirming the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the program is correct.
