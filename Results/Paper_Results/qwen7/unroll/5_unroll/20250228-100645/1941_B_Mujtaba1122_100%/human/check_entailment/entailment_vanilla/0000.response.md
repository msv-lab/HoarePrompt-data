Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1, and if the previous and next elements are also greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - After performing the operation, it checks if the previous element (`list[i - 1]`) is still not zero. If it is not zero, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Validity**:
   - The operation defined in the problem is valid and can reduce the values of the array as required.

2. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the operation is applied only when the conditions are met, which is necessary to avoid invalid states.
   - If at any point the operation cannot be performed (i.e., the previous element becomes zero), it correctly identifies that the array cannot be reduced to all zeros and prints 'NO'.
   - If the array can be reduced to all zeros, it correctly identifies this and prints 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the array might already be in a state where no further operations can be performed.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
