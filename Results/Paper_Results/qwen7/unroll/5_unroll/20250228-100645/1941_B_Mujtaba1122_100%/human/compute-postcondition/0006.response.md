Based on the initial state and the operations described:

1. The list `list` will be modified according to the operations inside the loop.
2. For each `i` from 1 to `n-2`, if `list[i] > 1` and both `list[i-1]` and `list[i+1]` are greater than 0, the value of `list[i]` is decreased by twice the value of `list[i-1]`, the value of `list[i+1]` is decreased by the value of `list[i-1]`, and the value of `list[i-1]` is decreased by itself (effectively halved).
3. If at any point `list[i-1]` is not zero during the execution of the loop, the program prints 'no' and returns immediately.
4. If the loop completes without printing 'no', the final state of the list `list` will be the result of all the operations performed within the loop.
5. The function `func_1(list, n)` returns `False`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('NO')` will execute only if the loop encounters a situation where `list[i-1]` is not zero at any point during the loop's execution. This would cause the program to print 'NO' and return immediately, preventing the loop from completing all iterations.

Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **NO**
