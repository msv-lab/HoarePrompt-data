Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_2`**: The logic in `func_2` does not correctly simulate the operations allowed by the problem statement. Specifically, the operations should reduce three consecutive elements, but the current implementation only modifies one element at a time and does not ensure that the operations are applied in the correct manner.

2. **Early Return and Printing**: The function `func_2` prints 'no' and returns immediately when it encounters a non-zero element during the operation checks. This means that even if the final state of the array could potentially be made zero, the function will incorrectly return 'NO'.

3. **Final Check Functionality**: The final check in `func_2` calls `func_1` to verify if all elements are zero. However, due to the early return and printing issue, this check is not properly utilized.

4. **Handling of Test Cases**: The solution does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem statement. It processes only one array at a time.

### Correct Solution:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure that the sum of the array elements is even because each operation reduces the sum by 4 (specifically, \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\)). If the sum is odd, it's impossible to make all elements zero. Additionally, we need to ensure that no element is too large compared to the others, which would prevent the operations from reducing all elements to zero.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def can_make_zero(t):
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check if the sum of the array is even
        if sum(arr) % 2 != 0:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Check if the maximum element is greater than the sum of other elements
        max_val = max(arr)
        if max_val > sum(arr) - max_val:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        print("YES")

# Example usage
t = int(input())
can_make_zero(t)
```

This solution correctly handles the constraints and logic required to determine if all elements can be made zero.
