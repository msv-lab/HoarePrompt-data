You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Rudolf has an array a of n integers, the elements are numbered from 1 to n .

In one operation, he can choose an index i (2 \le i \le n - 1 ) and assign:

  * a_{i - 1} = a_{i - 1} - 1 
  * a_i = a_i - 2 
  * a_{i + 1} = a_{i + 1} - 1 

Rudolf can apply this operation any number of times. Any index i can be used
zero or more times.

Can he make all the elements of the array equal to zero using this operation?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases in the test.

The first line of each case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of each case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le
a_j \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to make all the elements of
the array zero using the described operations. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the first example, the original array is [1, 3, 5, 5, 2] , to make all its
elements zero, Rudolf can act as follows:

  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [1, 3, 4, 3, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=3 and get the array [1, 2, 2, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=2 and get the array [0, 0, 1, 2, 1] ; 
  * apply the operation at i=4 and get the array [0, 0, 0, 0, 0] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(list, n):
    for i in range(n):
        if list[i] != 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(list, n):
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        while list[i] > 1 and list[i - 1] > 0 and (list[i + 1] > 0):
            list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
            list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]
            list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]
        if list[i - 1] != 0:
            print('no')
            return
    if func_1(list, n):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a list of integers and an integer n. It modifies the list according to specific rules within a loop. For each index i from 1 to n-2, if the element at index i is greater than 1 and the elements at indices i-1 and i+1 are greater than 0, it decreases the element at index i by twice the value of the element at index i-1, decreases the element at index i+1 by the value of the element at index i-1, and decreases the element at index i-1 by itself (effectively halving it). If at any point the element at index i-1 is not zero, it prints 'no' and returns immediately. If the loop completes without printing 'no', it calls another function `func_1(list, n)`. Based on the result of `func_1`, it prints either 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state of the list is the result of all the operations performed within the loop.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if all elements in the list are zero.
   - It iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an element that is not zero.
   - If all elements are zero, it returns `True`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to reduce the array to all zeros using the specified operations.
   - It iterates through the array from index 1 to n-2 (inclusive).
   - For each index `i`, it checks if the current element `list[i]` is greater than 1, and if the previous and next elements are also greater than 0.
   - If these conditions are met, it performs the operation:
     - `list[i + 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i] -= 2 * list[i - 1]`
     - `list[i - 1] -= 1 * list[i - 1]`
   - After performing the operation, it checks if the previous element (`list[i - 1]`) is still not zero. If it is not zero, it prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
   - After the loop, it calls `func_1` to check if all elements are zero. If they are, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis

1. **Operation Validity**:
   - The operation defined in the problem is valid and can reduce the values of the array as required.

2. **Function `func_2` Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` ensures that the operation is applied only when the conditions are met, which is necessary to avoid invalid states.
   - If at any point the operation cannot be performed (i.e., the previous element becomes zero), it correctly identifies that the array cannot be reduced to all zeros and prints 'NO'.
   - If the array can be reduced to all zeros, it correctly identifies this and prints 'YES'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the array might already be in a state where no further operations can be performed.
   - It correctly identifies arrays that cannot be reduced to all zeros.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the specified operations. Therefore, the program is correct.
