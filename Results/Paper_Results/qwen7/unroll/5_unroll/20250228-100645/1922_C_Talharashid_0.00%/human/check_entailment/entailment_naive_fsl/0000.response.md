Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the program attempts to precompute distances to the closest city for each city but does not correctly handle the logic for determining the minimum cost of travel between two cities.

The core issue lies in how the program calculates the minimum number of coins required to travel between two cities. The program uses precomputed values `d1` and `d2` to store the cumulative distances to the closest city from the start and end of the list, respectively. However, these values are not used effectively to compute the minimum cost of travel between any two cities.

Here is a counterexample to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
1
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output is:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not correctly account for the minimum cost of travel using the closest city. For instance, in the first query (city 1 to city 4), the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 3 instead of the correct cost of 2 coins (travel to city 2, then to city 4).

To fix this, the program needs to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum cost of travel between any two cities, considering the unique property that the closest city is always the optimal choice for minimizing the cost.
