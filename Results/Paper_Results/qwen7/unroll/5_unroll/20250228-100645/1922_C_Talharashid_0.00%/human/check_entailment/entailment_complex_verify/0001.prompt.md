You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each input value of t, there are two dictionaries d1 and d2 which store intermediate results of the calculations. There is a list lst which contains integers based on user input. Variable s is used to accumulate values during the calculation process. After processing all inputs, there are m queries where start and end indices are provided, and for each query, the minimum value between the absolute differences calculated from d1 and d2 is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a list of integers `lst` and calculates two dictionaries `d1` and `d2` that store intermediate results. It then handles `m` queries, each providing two indices `start` and `end`. For each query, it computes the minimum value between the absolute differences obtained from `d1` and `d2` and prints the result.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires calculating the minimum number of coins needed to travel between two cities. The cost of traveling directly between two cities \(x\) and \(y\) is \(|a_x - a_y|\), and the cost of traveling to the closest city is 1 coin.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code attempts to precompute the "steps" taken to reach each city from the starting city using a forward and backward approach.
   - `d1` and `d2` are dictionaries that store the cumulative steps taken to reach each city from the start and end, respectively.
   - The while loops in the code are intended to compute these steps but do not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

3. **Issues Identified**:
   - The logic inside the while loops is flawed. It does not correctly compute the number of steps to reach each city.
   - The variables `mini`, `s`, and `inc` are used incorrectly. They should be used to find the closest city efficiently, but they are not implemented correctly.
   - The final computation of the minimum cost between two cities also seems incorrect because it relies on the incorrect precomputed values stored in `d1` and `d2`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the issues with the logic and implementation, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
