Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. According to the problem description, we need to maximize the score by selecting pairs of numbers and adding the minimum of the pair to the score. However, the program does not properly handle the pairing and selection process.

Specifically, the program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads a number `a`, which seems to be a single integer rather than the total number of integers on the whiteboard (which is `2n`). It then reads another integer `b` and splits it into a list, but it does not sort the list or correctly pair and sum the minimum values of each pair.

Here is an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the input:
```
1
2
2 4
```

The expected output should be 2 because the optimal strategy is to choose the smallest pair (2, 4) and add the minimum value (2) to the score.

However, the program will read `a` as 2 and `b` as "2 4". It will split `b` into a list but will not sort it or correctly pair the elements. Instead, it will simply take the first element (2) and add it to the output list, resulting in an output of 2. This is correct for this specific example, but the program fails to handle the general case correctly.

A correct implementation would involve sorting the list of numbers and then summing the minimum values of each pair. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        index += 1
        numbers = sorted([int(data[index + i]) for i in range(2 * n)])
        index += 2 * n
        score = sum(numbers[i] for i in range(0, 2 * n, 2))
        results.append(score)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This corrected version correctly sorts the numbers and sums the minimum values of each pair, ensuring the maximum score is achieved.
