Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for numbers in range(int(num))`. The key objects here are `numbers`, `num`, and the `range` function.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `num` is an input integer such that \(1 \leq num \leq 50\).
   - `numbers` is a variable that will take values from the range generated by `range(int(num))`.
   - `out` is an empty list, and this object is not part of the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

3. **Understand the loop execution**:
   - The loop will iterate over the range starting from 0 up to but not including `int(num)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `int(num)` must be at least 1 (since the range function generates values from 0 to `int(num) - 1`).

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on `num` to generate the range, `num` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `numbers` will change with each iteration, but we don't need to specify its exact value before the loop starts because it will be assigned within the loop body.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `num` and `out`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `num` must be at least 1, `out` is an empty list**
