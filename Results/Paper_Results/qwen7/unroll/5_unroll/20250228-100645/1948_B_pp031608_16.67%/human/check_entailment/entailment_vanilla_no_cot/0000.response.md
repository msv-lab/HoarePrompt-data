Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Function `func_1` Usage**: The function `func_1` is used to check if the list is sorted, but it should be used to verify if the transformation process can achieve a sorted list. However, the program directly uses `func_1` without any transformation logic applied to the list before checking.

2. **Transformation Logic Issue**: The transformation logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the code attempts to split elements greater than 10 into their individual digits and insert them back into the list. However, the logic for splitting and reinserting digits is not implemented correctly. The current implementation does not handle the splitting and reinsertion properly.

3. **Loop Condition and Transformation**: The loop condition and transformation logic are not correctly aligned. The loop should iterate through the list and apply the transformation only when necessary, but the current implementation does not correctly handle the transformation and rechecking after each operation.

4. **Missing Implementation of Digit Splitting**: The actual logic to split a number into its digits and insert them back into the list is missing. This is crucial for the problem's requirements.

### Corrected Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to implement the digit splitting and insertion logic and ensure that the list is checked after each transformation to see if it is sorted. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    list1 = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    def split_and_insert(lst, index):
        num = lst[index]
        if num >= 10:
            digits = [int(d) for d in str(num)]
            lst.pop(index)
            lst[index:index] = digits
    
    def is_sorted(lst):
        return lst == sorted(lst)
    
    while True:
        sorted_now = is_sorted(list1)
        if sorted_now:
            print('Yes')
            break
        changed = False
        for p in range(1, len(list1)):
            if list1[p - 1] > list1[p] and list1[p - 1] >= 10:
                split_and_insert(list1, p - 1)
                changed = True
        if not changed:
            print('No')
            break
```

This corrected version includes the necessary logic to split and insert digits and checks if the list is sorted after each transformation. It ensures that the transformations are applied until the list is sorted or determines that it is impossible to sort the list.
