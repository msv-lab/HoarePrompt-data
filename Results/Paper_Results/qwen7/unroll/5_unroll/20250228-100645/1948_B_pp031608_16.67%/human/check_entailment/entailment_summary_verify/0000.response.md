### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided program. Let's break down the problems and verify the program's behavior step-by-step using the function summary and the problem description.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:

1. **Incorrect Operation Handling**:
   - The program does not correctly implement the operation of splitting elements that are at least 10 and inserting their digits back into the array.
   - The check `if not func_1(list1)` is not appropriate because it does not reflect the intended logic of the operation.

2. **Sorting Check**:
   - The function `func_1(lst)` only checks if the list is sorted without considering the transformation of elements.
   - This means the program cannot correctly determine if the array can be made sorted through the allowed operations.

3. **Example Case**:
   - For the input `[12, 3, 45, 67]`, the correct approach would involve splitting the elements as described. However, the program does not perform these splits and instead checks if the original array is sorted, leading to incorrect results.

#### Detailed Analysis:

Let's consider the example input `[12, 3, 45, 67]` and see how the program behaves:

1. **Initial Array**: `[12, 3, 45, 67]`
2. **Check if Sorted**: `func_1([12, 3, 45, 67])` returns `False` (since it is not sorted).
3. **Operation Attempt**: The program tries to find an element greater than 10 and perform the operation. It finds `12` and attempts to split it, but the operation is not correctly implemented.
4. **After Operation**: The array remains `[12, 3, 45, 67]`.
5. **Final Check**: `func_1([12, 3, 45, 67])` still returns `False`, leading to the output `No`.

However, the correct approach would involve splitting `12` to `[1, 2]`, `45` to `[4, 5]`, and `67` to `[6, 7]`. The resulting array would be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, which is sorted.

Given these points, the program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle the transformation of elements properly.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle the transformation of elements properly, making it incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
