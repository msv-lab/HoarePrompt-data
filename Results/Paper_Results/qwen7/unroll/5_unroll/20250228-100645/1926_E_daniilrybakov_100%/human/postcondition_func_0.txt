The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50,000). For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) where \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \). It then computes a specific value based on these inputs using a loop, which involves modifying \( n \) and \( k \) according to certain conditions. Finally, it prints the computed value for each test case.
