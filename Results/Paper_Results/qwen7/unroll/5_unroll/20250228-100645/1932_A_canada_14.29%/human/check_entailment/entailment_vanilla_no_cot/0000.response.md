Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Variable Naming Conflict**: The variable `len` shadows the built-in Python function `len`. This can lead to unexpected behavior. It should be renamed to something like `path_length`.

2. **Logic Error in Thorns Handling**: The logic for handling thorns is incorrect. The program increments `thorn` when encountering a thorn but does not properly reset it or handle the condition where two consecutive thorns appear. The current implementation will incorrectly skip over all cells after encountering the first thorn.

3. **Break Condition**: The `break` statement inside the loop will terminate the loop prematurely if two consecutive thorns are encountered, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, the program should continue to count coins until it encounters a thorn.

4. **Resetting Thorns Counter**: The line `thorn == 0` is a comparison and does nothing; it should be `thorn = 0` to reset the counter.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        path_length = int(input())
        s = list(input())
        ret = 0
        thorn_count = 0
        for i in range(path_length):
            if s[i] == '@':
                thorn_count = 0
                ret += 1
            elif s[i] == '*':
                thorn_count += 1
                if thorn_count == 2:
                    break
            else:
                thorn_count = 0
        print(ret)
```

This corrected version addresses the issues mentioned above and should work correctly for the given problem.
