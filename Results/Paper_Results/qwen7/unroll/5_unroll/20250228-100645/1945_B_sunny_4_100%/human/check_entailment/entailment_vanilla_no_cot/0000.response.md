Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution calculates the number of fireworks visible using the formula `ans = m // a + m // b + 2`. However, this formula does not correctly account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations. The correct approach should consider the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to find the intervals where fireworks from both installations overlap.

The correct solution should be:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for qi in range(t):
        (a, b, m) = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        lcm_ab = (a * b) // math.gcd(a, b)
        # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation
        A = m // a + 1
        B = m // b + 1
        # Subtract 1 for the overlapping fireworks counted twice
        C = m // lcm_ab + 1
        print(A + B - C)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time by considering the LCM of `a` and `b` to avoid double-counting the overlapping fireworks.
