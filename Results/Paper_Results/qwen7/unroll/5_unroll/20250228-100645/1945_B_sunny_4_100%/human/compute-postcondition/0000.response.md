Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}; A and B are calculated as A=int(m/a)+1 and B=int(m/b)+1 respectively, and the sum A+B is printed for each test case.**

Explanation: The code first reads an integer `t` from input, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. It then calculates `A` and `B` using the formulas `A=int(m/a)+1` and `B=int(m/b)+1`, respectively. Finally, it prints the sum `A+B` for each test case. The values of `t`, `a`, `b`, `m`, `A`, and `B` are updated accordingly for each test case, but the initial constraints on `t`, `a`, `b`, and `m` remain valid.
