Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. According to the problem description, the formula used in the program `ans = m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect. This formula assumes that every firework launched by either installation will be visible at the same time, which is not true due to the overlapping visibility periods.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `6 7 4`
- Expected Output: `2`

However, the program incorrectly calculates the result as follows:
- `A = m // a + 1 = 4 // 6 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `B = m // b + 1 = 4 // 7 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`
- `ans = A + B = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4`

The correct approach involves considering the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` to determine the intervals where both installations launch fireworks at the same time. The correct formula should account for the LCM to ensure accurate calculation of simultaneous visibility.

Since the provided program does not handle the problem correctly, the correctness is **False**.
