Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it calculates the number of steps (`t`) required to reduce an integer `x` (2 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) to 1 by either halving it when it is even or decrementing it by 1 when it is odd. During this process, it maintains two values, `max` and `min`, which are updated accordingly. After calculating `t`, it constructs a list `ans` containing these values and prints both `t` and `ans`.**
