Output State: t is the number of steps required to reduce x to 1 by repeatedly dividing even numbers by 2 and subtracting 1 from odd numbers, with max initialized to 100000000 and min initialized to -100000000. ans is a list containing integers where each element alternates between the current value of max (reduced by 1 in each iteration) and min (increased by 1 in each iteration), until x becomes 1. The list is reversed before printing.
