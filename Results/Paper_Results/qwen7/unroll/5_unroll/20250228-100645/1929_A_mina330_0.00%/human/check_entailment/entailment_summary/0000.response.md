Reasoning:
The given program aims to maximize the beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the values \((a_i - a_{i-1})\) for all integers \(i\) from 2 to \(n\). 

To maximize this, we should pair the smallest element with the largest, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on. This ensures that the positive differences are maximized while minimizing the negative differences.

The program does the following:
1. Reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It sorts the array.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on.

This approach is correct because sorting the array allows us to pair the smallest and largest elements, which will indeed maximize the sum of the differences as required.

Given the execution summary and the reasoning above, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array.

Correctness: **True**
