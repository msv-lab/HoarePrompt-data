Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, followed by an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The function does not return anything explicitly but processes each test case according to the given constraints.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `t` indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer `n` defining the size of the following array, and an array of `n` integers within specified ranges. However, since the function signature does not include any parameters, it implies that the function reads input from an external source (like standard input or a file) and processes the data accordingly.
