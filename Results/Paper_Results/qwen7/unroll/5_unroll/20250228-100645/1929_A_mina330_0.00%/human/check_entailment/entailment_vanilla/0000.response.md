### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize positive differences and minimize negative ones.
   - Sorting the array and pairing the smallest and largest values together can help achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array, pairing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the array.
   - For each pair, it calculates the difference and adds it to the total beauty.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic:
     - When the array is sorted, the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.
     - By pairing the smallest element with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, etc., we ensure that the differences are maximized.
     - This approach works because the differences \(a_{len(a)-i-1} - a[i]\) will be the largest possible differences for each pair.

4. **Examples:**
   - For the example input `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. Pairing gives \( (3-2) + (2-1) = 2 \), which matches the expected output.
   - For the example input `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting and pairing gives \(0\) since all elements are the same.
   - For the example input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting and pairing gives \( (90-43) + (80-54) + (100-100) = 57 \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**
