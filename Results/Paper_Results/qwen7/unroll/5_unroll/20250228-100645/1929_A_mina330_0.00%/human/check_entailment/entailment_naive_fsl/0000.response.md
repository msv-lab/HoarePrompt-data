Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program attempts to maximize the beauty of the array by sorting it and then pairing the largest and smallest elements to calculate the difference. However, this approach does not always yield the maximum beauty. For instance, consider the input:

```
5
10 5 2 1 8
```

The program sorts the array to `[2, 5, 8, 10, 10]` and calculates the beauty as `(10-2) + (10-5) + (8-10) = 8 + 5 - 2 = 11`.

However, the optimal arrangement could be `[1, 2, 5, 8, 10]`, which gives a beauty of `(2-1) + (5-2) + (8-5) + (10-8) = 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 9`.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, making it incorrect.
