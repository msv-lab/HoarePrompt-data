You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    ntest = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, ntest, 1):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        kq = 0
        for i in range(0, len(a) // 2, 1):
            kq = kq + a[len(a) - i - 1] - a[i]
        print(kq)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n integers. It sorts the list, then calculates the sum of differences between the largest and smallest elements, the second largest and second smallest elements, and so on. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case individually.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the beauty of the array \(a\) which is defined as the sum of differences \( (a_i - a_{i-1}) \) for \(i\) from 2 to \(n\).
   - To maximize this sum, we should aim to maximize positive differences and minimize negative ones.
   - Sorting the array and pairing the smallest and largest values together can help achieve this.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array and the array itself.
   - It sorts the array.
   - It then iterates over the first half of the sorted array, pairing each element with the corresponding element from the end of the array.
   - For each pair, it calculates the difference and adds it to the total beauty.

3. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the logic:
     - When the array is sorted, the smallest elements are at the beginning and the largest elements are at the end.
     - By pairing the smallest element with the largest, the next smallest with the next largest, etc., we ensure that the differences are maximized.
     - This approach works because the differences \(a_{len(a)-i-1} - a[i]\) will be the largest possible differences for each pair.

4. **Examples:**
   - For the example input `[2, 1, 3]`, sorting gives `[1, 2, 3]`. Pairing gives \( (3-2) + (2-1) = 2 \), which matches the expected output.
   - For the example input `[69, 69, 69]`, sorting and pairing gives \(0\) since all elements are the same.
   - For the example input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, sorting and pairing gives \( (90-43) + (80-54) + (100-100) = 57 \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to maximize the beauty of the array.
