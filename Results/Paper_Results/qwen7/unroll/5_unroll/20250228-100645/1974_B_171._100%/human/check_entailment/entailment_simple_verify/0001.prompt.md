You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly decodes the encoded strings according to the provided problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits the data into individual components.
   - It then iterates through each test case, extracting the necessary information (length of the encoded string and the encoded string itself).

2. **Decoding Logic:**
   - For each test case, it calls the `func_1` function with the encoded string.
   - In `func_1`, it first finds all unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.
   - It creates a mapping where each character in the sorted unique characters list is paired with its corresponding symmetric character from the end of the list.
   - Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its mapped value.

### Verification of Correctness:

1. **Unique Characters and Sorting:**
   - The program correctly identifies and sorts the unique characters in the encoded string.

2. **Mapping Creation:**
   - The mapping creation logic is correct. Each character is paired with its symmetric counterpart, ensuring the correct transformation.

3. **Decoding Process:**
   - The decoding process correctly uses the mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the symmetric mapping.

4. **Output:**
   - The decoded strings are printed out correctly for each test case.

### Example Walkthrough:

Given the example input:
```
5
10
serofedsoc
3
ttf
9
tlrhgmaoi
1
w
15
hnndledmnhlttin
```

- **Test Case 1:**
  - Encoded string: `serofedsoc`
  - Unique characters: `cdefors`
  - Mapping: `c -> s`, `d -> r`, `e -> e`, `f -> d`, `o -> o`, `r -> c`, `s -> s`
  - Decoded string: `codeforces`

- **Test Case 2:**
  - Encoded string: `ttf`
  - Unique characters: `ft`
  - Mapping: `f -> t`, `t -> f`
  - Decoded string: `fft`

- **Test Case 3:**
  - Encoded string: `tlrhgmaoi`
  - Unique characters: `aimghlorst`
  - Mapping: `a -> t`, `i -> i`, `m -> m`, `g -> g`, `h -> h`, `l -> l`, `r -> r`, `o -> o`, `s -> s`, `t -> a`
  - Decoded string: `algorithm`

- **Test Case 4:**
  - Encoded string: `w`
  - Unique characters: `w`
  - Mapping: `w -> w`
  - Decoded string: `w`

- **Test Case 5:**
  - Encoded string: `hnndledmnhlttin`
  - Unique characters: `dehilmntn`
  - Mapping: `d -> n`, `e -> t`, `h -> h`, `i -> i`, `l -> l`, `m -> m`, `n -> d`, `t -> t`, `t -> t`, `i -> i`
  - Decoded string: `meetinthemiddle`

All these examples show that the program correctly decodes the encoded strings.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the decoding logic as described in the problem statement.

**Correctness: **True**
