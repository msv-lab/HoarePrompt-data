### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Reading Input:
The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to extract the number of test cases, the length of each encoded string, and the encoded strings themselves. This part is correct and well-implemented.

#### Decoding Logic:
1. **Extracting Unique Characters and Sorting:**
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
   ```
   This line correctly extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.

2. **Creating the Character Mapping:**
   ```python
   char_map = {}
   len_unique = len(unique_chars)
   for i in range(len_unique):
       char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
   ```
   This loop creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character in `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the list towards the start. This is the correct approach to create the reverse mapping needed for decoding.

3. **Generating the Decoded String:**
   ```python
   decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
   ```
   This line correctly generates the decoded string by replacing each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character from the `char_map`.

#### Handling Edge Cases:
- **Single-Character Strings:** The program handles single-character strings correctly because the unique character set will contain only one element, and the reverse mapping will map it to itself.
- **Strings with Repeated Characters:** The program also handles strings with repeated characters correctly because the reverse mapping is applied uniformly to each character in the encoded string.

#### Consistency:
- The program consistently applies the same logic across all test cases, ensuring that the decoding process is uniform and correct.

Given the above analysis, the provided program correctly implements the decoding logic and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
