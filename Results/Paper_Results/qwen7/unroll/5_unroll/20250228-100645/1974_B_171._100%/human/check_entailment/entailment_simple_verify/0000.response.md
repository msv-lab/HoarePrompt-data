### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness.

#### Reading Input:
The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to extract the number of test cases, the length of each encoded string, and the encoded strings themselves. This part is correct and consistent with the problem description.

#### Decoding Logic:
1. **Extracting Unique Characters and Sorting**:
   ```python
   unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
   ```
   This line correctly extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them alphabetically.

2. **Creating the Character Mapping**:
   ```python
   char_map = {}
   len_unique = len(unique_chars)
   for i in range(len_unique):
       char_map[unique_chars[i]] = unique_chars[len_unique - 1 - i]
   ```
   This loop creates a dictionary `char_map` where each unique character from the sorted list `unique_chars` is mapped to its corresponding character from the end of the list towards the start. This is the correct way to create the symmetric mapping.

3. **Decoding the Encoded String**:
   ```python
   decoded = ''.join(char_map[ch] for ch in encoded)
   ```
   This line correctly decodes the encoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding character from `char_map`.

#### Handling Edge Cases:
- **Single-Character Strings**: The program will still work correctly because the `set` operation will handle a single character as a set with one element, and the `sorted` function will sort it.
- **Strings with Repeated Characters**: The `set` operation ensures that each unique character is considered only once, and the sorting and mapping steps will handle these correctly.

#### Consistency:
- The program consistently applies the same logic across all test cases, ensuring that the decoding process is uniform and correct.

Given the analysis above, the program correctly implements the decoding logic and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the program.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly decodes the encoded string according to the problem description.
