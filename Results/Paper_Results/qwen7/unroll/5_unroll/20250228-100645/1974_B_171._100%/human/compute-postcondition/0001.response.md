Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `unique_chars` is a list of the sorted unique characters from `encoded`; `char_map` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `char_map`. This dictionary does not affect the values of `encoded` or `unique_chars`, so their states remain unchanged.
