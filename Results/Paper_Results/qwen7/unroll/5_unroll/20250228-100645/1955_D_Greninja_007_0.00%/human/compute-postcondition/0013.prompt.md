You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, k, n, and m are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n, and 1 <= n, m, k <= 2 * 10^5.
def func_1(a, b, k, n, m):
    good_subarrays = 0
    b_freq = Counter(b)
    window_freq = Counter(a[:m])
    matches = sum(min(window_freq[x], b_freq[x]) for x in window_freq if x in
    b_freq)
    for i in range(n - m):
        if matches >= k:
            good_subarrays += 1
        
        if a[i] in b_freq:
            matches -= min(window_freq[a[i]], b_freq[a[i]])
        
        window_freq[a[i]] -= 1
        
        if window_freq[a[i]] == 0:
            del window_freq[a[i]]
        
        if a[i + m] in b_freq:
            matches += min(window_freq[a[i + m]] + 1, b_freq[a[i + m]])
        
        window_freq[a[i + m]] += 1
        
    #State: Output State: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of `a` with length `m` where the number of matching elements (considering their minimum frequency) with list `b` is at least `k`.
    if (matches >= k) :
        good_subarrays += 1
    #State: Postcondition: `good_subarrays` is the count of subarrays of `a` with length `m` where the number of matching elements (considering their minimum frequency) with list `b` is at least `k`. If the current value of `matches` is greater than or equal to `k`, `good_subarrays` is incremented by 1.
    return good_subarrays
    #The program returns the count of subarrays of 'a' with length 'm' where the number of matching elements (considering their minimum frequency) with list 'b' is at least 'k'.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of integers `a`, a list of integers `b`, an integer `k`, an integer `n`, and an integer `m`. It returns the count of subarrays of `a` with length `m` where the number of matching elements (considering their minimum frequency) with list `b` is at least `k`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the count of subarrays of 'a' with length 'm' where the number of matching elements (considering their minimum frequency) with list 'b' is at least 'k'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
