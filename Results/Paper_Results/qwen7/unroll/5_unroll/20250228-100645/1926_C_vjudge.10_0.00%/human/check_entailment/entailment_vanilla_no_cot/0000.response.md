Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Loop for Summation**: The outer loop iterates `N` times, but it should only handle each test case individually. The inner loop `for i in range(n):` is iterating over all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which is unnecessary and incorrect. Each test case should be processed separately.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The `soma` variable accumulates the sum of digit sums for all numbers from 0 to `n-1`, which is not what the problem requires. The problem asks for the sum of the digit sums of the numbers from 1 to `n`.

3. **Function Call**: The function `func_1(i)` is called for each number `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, which again is incorrect. Instead, you should calculate the digit sum for each number from 1 to `n` directly.

### Corrected Program:
Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

t = int(input())
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    current_sum = sum(digit_sum(i) for i in range(1, n + 1))
    results.append(current_sum)

for result in results:
    print(result)
```

This corrected program:
- Defines a helper function `digit_sum` to compute the sum of digits of a number.
- Reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case, it computes the sum of digit sums for numbers from 1 to `n` using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
- Stores the result for each test case and prints them out.
