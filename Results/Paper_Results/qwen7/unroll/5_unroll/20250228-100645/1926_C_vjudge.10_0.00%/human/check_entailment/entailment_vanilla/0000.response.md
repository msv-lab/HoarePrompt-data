Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The program needs to calculate the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - For each number \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), replace \( i \) with the sum of its digits.
   - Finally, sum all these digit sums.

2. **Given Program:**
   ```python
   soma = 0
   N = int(input())
   for _ in range(N):
       n = int(input())
       for i in range(n):
           soma += func_1(i)
   print(soma)

   def func_1(n):
       return sum((int(d) for d in str(n)))
   ```

3. **Issues Identified:**
   - The outer loop `for _ in range(N):` should be iterating over the test cases, but the inner loop `for i in range(n):` is iterating from 0 to \( n-1 \). This means it is processing each number from 0 to \( n-1 \) instead of just from 1 to \( n \).
   - The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a number, but it is being called incorrectly.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - We need to iterate through each number from 1 to \( n \) and compute the sum of its digits.
   - Sum these values for all numbers from 1 to \( n \).

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))

t = int(input())
total_sum = 0
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    current_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_sum += func_1(i)
    total_sum += current_sum

print(total_sum)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Function Definition:**
   - `func_1(n)` remains the same, which correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a number \( n \).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - Read the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, read the value of \( n \).
   - Iterate from 1 to \( n \) and compute the sum of the digits for each number.
   - Add the computed sum for each test case to the total sum.

### Conclusion

The original program has a logical error due to the incorrect range in the inner loop. The corrected program will correctly solve the problem as described.

**Correctness:** **False**
