Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.
2. **Determine the current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n`.
   - `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`.
   - `st` is an empty set.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Given that `low` is 0, the condition simplifies to `0 + 1 < high` or `1 < high`.

4. **Check the current state of `high`**:
   - `high` is `n`, and `n` is an integer.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1.

5. **Consider the other variables**:
   - `low` is fixed at 0, so no adjustment is needed here.
   - `pos` and `st` do not affect the loop condition directly, so no adjustments are needed for these variables.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variable that needs to be adjusted is `high`. It must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.

Therefore, the modified state right before the loop should be:

State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n` and `n` must be greater than 1, `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not in `arr`, `st` is an empty set**.
