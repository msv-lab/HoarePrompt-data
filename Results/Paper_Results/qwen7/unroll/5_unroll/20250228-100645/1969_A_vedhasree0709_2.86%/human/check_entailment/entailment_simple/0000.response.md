Reasoning:
The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `if l[i] == i + 2 and l[i + 1] == i + 1:` checks if the current friend `i` and the next friend `i+1` are in a specific order (i.e., `i` is the best friend of `i+1` and vice versa). However, this condition is too restrictive and only covers a very specific scenario. The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party, which may involve more complex relationships among friends.

2. **Handling All Test Cases**: The code only prints '2' if the above specific condition is met. For any other case, it prints '3'. This is incorrect because the problem might require inviting more friends to ensure at least 2 friends come, even if the specific condition is not met.

3. **Logic Flaw**: The logic inside the loop is flawed and does not account for all possible scenarios where inviting fewer than 3 friends could still result in at least 2 friends coming to the party.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
