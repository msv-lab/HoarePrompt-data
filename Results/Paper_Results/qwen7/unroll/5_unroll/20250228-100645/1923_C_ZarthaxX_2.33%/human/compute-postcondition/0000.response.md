Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `q`, from the input using `map(int, input().split(' '))`. These values replace the placeholders for `n` and `q` in the initial state. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.
