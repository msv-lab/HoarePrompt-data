Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`, which is used as the iterator in the `range(1, n + 1)` function.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` being 1 (since the range starts from 1).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to continue**: The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

4. **Check the given states**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `q` is an input integer.
   - `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces.
   - `ones` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0.
   - `sum` is a list of `n+1` elements where each element is 0.

5. **Adjust the states**: Since the loop depends on the values of `i` and `n`, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 1 and that `n` is a valid integer that allows the loop to execute.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a valid integer**
