Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on an array of integers. It first calculates the cumulative count of 1s and the modified cumulative sum (each element reduced by its index) up to each position in the array. For each query, it checks if a certain condition is met within the specified range of the array and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly. After processing all queries, the function concludes.**
