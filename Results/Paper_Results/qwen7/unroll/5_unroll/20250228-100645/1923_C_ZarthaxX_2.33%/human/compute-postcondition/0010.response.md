Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer t, lists n and q, an array c of n positive integers, and q queries defined by pairs of integers (l_i, r_i). For each query, it checks the range [l_i, r_i] within the array c and returns specific information based on the values within that range.**

This functionality describes a function that, given a positive integer `t`, a number of test cases `n`, a number of queries `q`, an array `c` of `n` positive integers, and `q` queries each defined by two integers `l_i` and `r_i`, processes each query to check the specified range within the array `c` and returns relevant information about the values in that range.
