Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by spaces, `ones` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative count of 1s up to that index in `nums`, `sum` is a list of n+1 elements where each element is calculated as the cumulative sum of `nums` up to that index minus the index value, `q` is decremented after each iteration of the loop until it reaches 0, `l` and `r` are updated with values provided by user input for each iteration of the loop, `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are recalculated based on the current values of `l` and `r` for each iteration, and the loop prints either 'YES' or 'NO' based on the condition for each iteration. After all iterations, `q` will be 0.
