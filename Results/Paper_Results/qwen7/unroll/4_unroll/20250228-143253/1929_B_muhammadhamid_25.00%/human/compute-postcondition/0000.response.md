Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in Python when the value of the loop variable is not needed. It is typically used to indicate that the loop is being used for its side effects (like reading input) rather than for iterating over a sequence.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` returns a non-negative integer. However, since the problem specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), we know that the input will always be valid for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`, the only state that needs to be considered is the initial value of `t`.

Given the above analysis, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted to reflect the initial value of `t`.

**State:**
**`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000**
