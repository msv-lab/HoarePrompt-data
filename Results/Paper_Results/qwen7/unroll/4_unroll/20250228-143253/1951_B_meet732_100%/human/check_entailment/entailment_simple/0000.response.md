Reasoning:

1. **Initial Setup**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually. It also correctly identifies the initial position of the cow and its rating.

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to find the maximum number of matches the cow can win by potentially swapping positions with another cow.
   - It first identifies the rating of the cow at position `k` and then looks for the first two cows with ratings greater than this value.
   - Depending on the positions of these cows relative to `k`, the function calculates the maximum number of wins the cow can achieve.

3. **Edge Cases and Logic**:
   - If there are no cows with ratings greater than the cow at position `k`, the function returns `n - 1`, meaning the cow would win all matches if it were at the end.
   - If there is only one cow with a rating greater than the cow at position `k`, the logic checks if this cow is the first cow (index 0). If so, it returns `k - 1`. Otherwise, it returns either `ind[0] - 1` or `max(k - ind[0], ind[0] - 1)` based on the positions.
   - If there are two cows with ratings greater than the cow at position `k`, the function handles various scenarios to maximize the number of wins, considering the positions of these cows relative to `k`.

4. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the function appears to handle all edge cases and general cases appropriately.
   - The function correctly identifies the potential swaps and calculates the maximum number of wins based on the positions of the cows.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of wins for the cow at position `k`.

Correctness: **True**
