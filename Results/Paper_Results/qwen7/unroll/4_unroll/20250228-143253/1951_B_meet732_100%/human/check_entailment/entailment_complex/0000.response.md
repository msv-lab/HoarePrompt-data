Reasoning:
1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` aims to determine the maximum number of matches the cow at position `k` can win by potentially swapping its position with another cow.
   - The function first identifies the first two cows with ratings greater than the cow at position `k`.
   - Depending on the positions of these cows relative to `k`, the function calculates and returns the maximum number of wins.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If there are no cows with ratings greater than the cow at position `k`, the function returns `n - 1`, meaning the cow can win all remaining matches.
   - If there is only one cow with a rating greater than the cow at position `k`, the function considers whether this cow is the first or second cow in the list of cows with higher ratings.
   - If there are two or more cows with ratings greater than the cow at position `k`, the function considers the relative positions of these cows to determine the optimal number of wins.

3. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic in the function correctly handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem statement.
   - The function accurately calculates the maximum number of wins based on the positions of the cows with higher ratings relative to the cow at position `k`.

4. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement are correctly handled by the function.
   - The function returns the expected results for the given test cases.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
