Output State: **`removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array elements, `pos` is a list containing one element which is `s - 2 * n`, `s` is the sum of all elements in `elements`, `n` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The line `pos.append(s - 2 * n)` appends the value of `s - 2 * n` to the list `pos`. Since `pos` was initially an empty list, after executing this line, `pos` contains one element, which is `s - 2 * n`. The values of `removals`, `negatives`, `elements`, `s`, and `n` remain unchanged.
