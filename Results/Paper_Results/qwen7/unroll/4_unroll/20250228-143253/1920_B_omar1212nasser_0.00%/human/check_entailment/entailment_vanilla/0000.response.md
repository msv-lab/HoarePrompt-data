Let's analyze the provided program to determine its correctness based on the problem statement and examples.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and calls `func_2` with the parameters `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the optimal sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.
   - It has a conditional check that returns `0` if `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`. This condition seems arbitrary and not aligned with the problem logic.
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the initial sum `s` of the array and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `n`.
   - It appends `s - 2 * n` to `pos` to account for the scenario where Bob multiplies all `negatives` elements by `-1`.
   - It iteratively updates `s` and `n` by removing elements from the end of the sorted array and recalculates `s - 2 * n` for different numbers of removed elements up to `removals`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Arbitrary Condition**: The condition `if removals == 6 and negatives == 3: return 0` is not based on the problem description and does not align with the logic required to solve the problem correctly.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of `n`**: In the loop, the calculation of `n` might be incorrect. Specifically, when `negatives` exceeds the length of the array, `n` should be updated accordingly, but the current implementation might lead to incorrect results.

### Correct Implementation:
To address these issues, we need to correctly implement the logic for both Alice and Bob's optimal moves. Here is a corrected version of the functions:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        a = a[:n - k] + [-a[i] for i in range(n - k, n - x, -1)]
        print(sum(a))

def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    # No need for separate function, just use the logic directly in func_1
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Logic:
- **Sorting and Selection**: Sort the array and select the largest elements to keep.
- **Negatives**: For Bob, flip the smallest `negatives` elements.
- **Sum Calculation**: Sum the selected elements after processing.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is incorrect due to the arbitrary condition and potential issues in calculating `n`. The corrected logic should handle the problem as described.

**Final Answer:**
Correctness: **False**
