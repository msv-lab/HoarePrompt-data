Output State: The value of `prev` and `v1` are determined based on the comparisons made within the loop. Specifically, `v1` will hold the value that was compared with `prev` in the last iteration where `r` was either `<` or `=`. The value of `prev` will be the last position where the comparison resulted in `>` or `=`.
