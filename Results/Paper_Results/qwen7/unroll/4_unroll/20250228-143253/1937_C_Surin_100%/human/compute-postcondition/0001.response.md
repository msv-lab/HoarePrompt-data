Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, the function `R` is defined as a lambda function that returns an integer obtained from the input using `int(input)`**.

Explanation: The code defines a lambda function `R` that takes an input using `int(input())` and returns it as an integer. This does not affect the value of `t` or any other existing variables. Therefore, `t` remains an integer within the specified range, and the definition of the function `R` is updated accordingly.
