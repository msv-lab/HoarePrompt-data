Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, the function `I` is defined as a lambda function that returns a list of integers obtained from splitting the input by spaces and mapping each element to an integer**.

The code defines a lambda function `I` that reads a line of input, splits it by spaces, and converts each resulting string into an integer, returning the list of integers. However, no actual input is read or variables are assigned values within this snippet, so the values of `t` remain unchanged, and the definition of `I` is set.
