The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it determines two specific values, `prev` and `v1`, through a series of comparisons. It prints a sequence of queries to compare elements in a given permutation and updates `v1` and `prev` based on the comparison results. After processing all test cases, it outputs the final values of `prev` and `v1`.
