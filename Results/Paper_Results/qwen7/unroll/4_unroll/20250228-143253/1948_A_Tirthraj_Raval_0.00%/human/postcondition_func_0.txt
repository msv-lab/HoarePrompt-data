The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each case, it reads an integer \( n \) (between 1 and 50). If \( n \) is odd, it outputs 'NO'. If \( n \) is even, it outputs 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters, with the length of the string being \( n/2 \). After processing all test cases, no variables are returned, but the console will display the appropriate output for each case.
