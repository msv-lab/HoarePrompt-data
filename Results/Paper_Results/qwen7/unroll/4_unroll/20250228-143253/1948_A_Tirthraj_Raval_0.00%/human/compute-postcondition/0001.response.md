State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive) does not guarantee that the loop will execute, since `t` could be 1.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Hence, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t must be greater than 0`.
