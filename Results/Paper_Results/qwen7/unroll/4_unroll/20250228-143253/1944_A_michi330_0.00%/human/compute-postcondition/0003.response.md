Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either "1" or "n - 1". Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the output will be "1", otherwise it will be "n - 1". Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not specified, the output can vary based on user input during each iteration.
