Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for each case.
3. For each set of integers, the function checks two conditions:
   - If \(a < b < c\), it prints 'STAIR'.
   - If \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'.
4. If neither condition is met, it prints 'NONE'.
5. The logic for determining 'STAIR' and 'PEAK' is correct according to the problem statement.
6. There is no need for the variable `mn` which was initialized but never used in the provided code.
7. The function correctly handles multiple test cases as specified in the problem description.

Given the above points, the function correctly implements the logic required to determine whether the digits form a stair, a peak, or neither.

Correctness: **True**
