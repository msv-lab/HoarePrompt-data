You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program:
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads a series of test cases from the user, where each test case consists of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks the relationship between these integers and prints one of three possible outputs: 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE'. After processing all test cases, it does not return any value but prints the results directly. The initial values of \(t\) and \(q\) remain unchanged throughout the function's execution.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the conditions for a stair or a peak. Specifically, the conditions for checking if the digits form a stair or a peak are not properly implemented. The program uses a single `if` statement for each condition without proper nesting, which means it will always print "STAIR" or "PEAK" based on the first condition met, regardless of the other condition. This leads to incorrect outputs for some cases.

For example, consider the input `1 5 3`. According to the problem description, this should be classified as a "PEAK" because `1 < 5 > 3`. However, the current implementation will incorrectly classify it as "STAIR" because the first condition `a < b < c` is not met, but the second condition `a < b > c` is not checked properly due to the lack of proper nesting.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for _ in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version properly checks both conditions and handles them correctly.
