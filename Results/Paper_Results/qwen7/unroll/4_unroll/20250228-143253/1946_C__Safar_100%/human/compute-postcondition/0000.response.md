Output State: **`g` is a list of empty lists with length `n + 1`, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed, and `edges` is a list of tuples where each tuple (a, b) represents an edge connecting vertices a and b.**

The code initializes a graph `g` as an adjacency list representation. It creates a list of empty lists, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. This means that there are `n + 1` elements in the list, and each element is an empty list initially. The values of `n`, `k`, and the `edges` list remain unchanged from the initial state.
