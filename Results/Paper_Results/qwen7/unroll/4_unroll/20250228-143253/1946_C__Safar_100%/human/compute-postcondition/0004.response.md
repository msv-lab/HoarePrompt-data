Output State: **`c` is 0, `g` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is a list representing the neighbors of the corresponding vertex in the tree.**

Explanation: The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The structure of the list `g` remains unchanged from the initial state, as no operations are performed on `g`.
