Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads integers \(t\), \(n\), \(k\), and \(m\), and a string \(s\) of length \(m\) consisting of the first \(k\) lowercase English alphabets. It then checks if the number of distinct substrings of \(s\) that contain all \(k\) characters is at least \(n\). If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a string constructed from the characters of \(s\) and the character 'a'. The function ensures that \(t\) is between 1 and \(10^5\), \(n\) and \(k\) are between 1 and 26, \(m\) is between 1 and 1000, and the sum of \(m\) across all test cases does not exceed \(10^6\).**
