Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Sorting the Array**: The array `a` is sorted in non-increasing order. This is important because Alice will remove the largest elements first, and Bob will negate the smallest elements first to minimize the sum.

3. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The initial sum `ans1` is calculated as the sum of the sorted array. This is a good starting point.

4. **Alice's Removal**: For each of the `x` negations by Bob, `ans1` is adjusted by subtracting twice the value of the smallest element in the sorted array. This is because each negation by Bob effectively reduces the sum by twice the value of the smallest element (since the smallest element is negated and then added back with its original value).

5. **Bob's Negation**: For each of the `k` removals by Alice, `ans1` is adjusted by adding the value of the smallest element in the sorted array. If Alice removes an element before Bob negates it, the effect on the sum needs to be recalculated. However, the current implementation seems to handle this correctly by considering the impact of both Alice's removal and Bob's negation.

6. **Final Answer**: The final answer is the maximum of `ans1` and `ans2`, which ensures that the sum is maximized under the optimal strategies of both players.

Given the above analysis, the logic in the program appears to be sound and correctly implements the described game rules.

Correctness: **True**
