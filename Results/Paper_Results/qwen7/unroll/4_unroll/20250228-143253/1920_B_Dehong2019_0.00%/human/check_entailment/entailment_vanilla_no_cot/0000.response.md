Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans1`**:
   - The logic for calculating `ans1` is flawed. It subtracts twice the smallest elements, which is not optimal. Alice should remove the smallest elements, and Bob should negate the smallest positive elements to minimize the sum.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of `ans2`**:
   - The calculation of `ans2` is also incorrect. It does not properly account for the optimal strategy where Alice removes the smallest elements and Bob negates the smallest positive elements.

3. **Optimal Strategy Not Implemented**:
   - The optimal strategy involves Alice removing the smallest elements and Bob negating the smallest positive elements. The current implementation does not correctly implement this strategy.

### Correct Solution:
Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sort the array in ascending order
        a.sort()
        
        # Calculate the initial sum
        total_sum = sum(a)
        
        # Alice removes the smallest k elements
        for i in range(k):
            total_sum -= a[i]
        
        # Bob negates the smallest x positive elements
        for i in range(x):
            if a[i] > 0:
                total_sum -= 2 * a[i]
            else:
                break
        
        print(total_sum)

func()
```

This solution correctly implements the optimal strategy for both Alice and Bob:
- Alice removes the smallest `k` elements.
- Bob negates the smallest `x` positive elements.

This ensures that the sum of the array after the game is calculated correctly.
