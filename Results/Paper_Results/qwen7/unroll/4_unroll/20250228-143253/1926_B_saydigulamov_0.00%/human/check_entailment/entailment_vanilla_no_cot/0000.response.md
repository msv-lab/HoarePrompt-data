Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**: 
   - The program only checks if the count of `1`s in the first two rows is the same (`k[0] == k[1]`). This logic is insufficient to determine the shape.
   - For a square, the count of `1`s in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the count of `1`s in each row follows a specific pattern (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...).

2. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The program does not check the entire grid to ensure the shape is consistent throughout.
   - It only checks the counts of `1`s in the first two rows, which is not enough to determine the shape accurately.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the shape, you need to:
- Check if the shape is a square by verifying that the count of `1`s in each row is the same.
- Check if the shape is a triangle by verifying the pattern of `1`s in each row.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if it's a square
        if all(grid[i].count('1') == n // 2 + 1 for i in range(n)):
            print("SQUARE")
            continue
        
        # Check if it's a triangle
        for i in range(1, n):
            if len(grid[i]) != 2 * i + 1 or grid[i][len(grid[i]) // 2] != '1':
                break
        else:
            print("TRIANGLE")
            continue
        
        # If neither square nor triangle
        print("NEITHER")

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program:
1. Checks if the grid forms a square by ensuring each row has the same number of `1`s.
2. Checks if the grid forms a triangle by ensuring the pattern of `1`s matches the expected pattern for a triangle.
3. Handles cases where the shape is neither a square nor a triangle.
