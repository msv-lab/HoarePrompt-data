Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Instead, it only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's and prints those counts if they do. This logic is insufficient to determine the shape because:

1. **Triangle Detection**: A triangle can have different numbers of '1's in each row. For example, a triangle with `k=3` would have rows with 5, 3, and 1 '1's respectively.
2. **Square Detection**: A square with `k=3` would have 3 '1's in each row.
3. The program does not check the entire grid structure to see if the pattern matches a triangle or a square.

Given the problem statement and the need to correctly identify the shape, the current implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the program should be revised to properly detect the shapes based on the given criteria.

Correctness: **False**
