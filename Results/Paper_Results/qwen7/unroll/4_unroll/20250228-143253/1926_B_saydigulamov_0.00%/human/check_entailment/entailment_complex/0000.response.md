Reasoning:

1. The provided code does not correctly identify whether the grid represents a triangle or a square. Instead, it only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's.
2. This approach fails to handle both triangles and squares properly because:
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases linearly (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...).
3. The current implementation does not check the entire grid for the pattern of a triangle or a square, and it does not differentiate between them based on their specific shapes.

Given the problem statement and the required functionality, the provided code is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
