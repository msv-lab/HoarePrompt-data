Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads a grid represented as a list of strings, where each string contains characters '0' or '1'. It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in a list. If the first two counts are equal, it prints these counts. Otherwise, it does nothing. The function does not return any value but prints the counts of '1's from the first two rows if they match.**
