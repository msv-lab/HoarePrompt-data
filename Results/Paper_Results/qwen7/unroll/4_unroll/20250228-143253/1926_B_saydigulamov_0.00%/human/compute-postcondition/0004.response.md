Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings. Each string contains n characters that are either '0' or '1'. The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's, and the size of the triangle or square is greater than 1. The function returns whether the shape found is a triangle or a square.**
