You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Maxim has an array a of n integers and an array b of m integers (m \le n ).

Maxim considers an array c of length m to be good if the elements of array c
can be rearranged in such a way that at least k of them match the elements of
array b .

For example, if b = [1, 2, 3, 4] and k = 3 , then the arrays [4, 1, 2, 3] and
[2, 3, 4, 5] are good (they can be reordered as follows: [1, 2, 3, 4] and [5,
2, 3, 4] ), while the arrays [3, 4, 5, 6] and [3, 4, 3, 4] are not good.

Maxim wants to choose every subsegment of array a of length m as the elements
of array c . Help Maxim count how many selected arrays will be good.

In other words, find the number of positions 1 \le l \le n - m + 1 such that
the elements a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_{l + m - 1} form a good array.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
k \le m \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in arrays a and b ,
the required number of matching elements.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array a . Elements of the array a are not
necessarily unique.

The third line of each test case contains m integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_m (1
\le b_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of array b . Elements of the array b are not
necessarily unique.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of m over all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of good subsegments of array a on a
separate line.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `m`, and `k` which define the sizes and constraints.
   - It then reads the array `a` of length `n` and the array `b` of length `m`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `todo` is initialized as a set containing all elements from `b`.
   - `done` is initialized as an empty set.
   - `extra` is initialized as an empty set.

3. **Initial Check**:
   - The program iterates through the first `m` elements of `a` to check which elements from `b` are present in `a`. 
     - If an element from `b` is found in `a`, it is moved from `todo` to `done`.
     - If not, it is added to `extra`.

4. **Counting Good Subsegments**:
   - The program then iterates through the remaining elements of `a` starting from index `m` to `n-1`.
   - For each new element entering the window (`a[r]`), it checks if the element leaving the window (`a[r-m]`) was in `done` or `extra`.
   - Depending on whether the element is in `done` or `extra`, it updates the sets accordingly.
   - It also updates the sets based on the new element entering the window.
   - If the number of elements in `done` is at least `k`, it increments the answer.

### Correctness Verification

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - The initial setup correctly identifies the elements from `b` that are already in the first `m` elements of `a`.

2. **Sliding Window Logic**:
   - The sliding window approach is used correctly to maintain the state of elements in `done` and `extra` as the window slides through `a`.
   - The logic for updating `done` and `extra` when elements enter and leave the window is correct.

3. **Condition Checking**:
   - The condition `if len(done) >= k:` correctly checks if the current window has at least `k` elements from `b`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where the initial window might already have enough elements from `b` to satisfy the condition.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to count the number of good subsegments of array `a` of length `m` that contain at least `k` elements from array `b`.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
