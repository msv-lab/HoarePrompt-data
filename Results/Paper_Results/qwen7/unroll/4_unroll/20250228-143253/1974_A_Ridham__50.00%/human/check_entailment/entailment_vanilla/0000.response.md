### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem statement.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `x` and `y`.

2. **Space Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the total space required for `x` (1x1 icons) and `y` (2x2 icons).
     - `space_x = x * 1` is correct because each 1x1 icon requires 1 cell.
     - `space_y = y * 4` is correct because each 2x2 icon requires 4 cells.
     - `total_space = space_y + space_x` is the total number of cells required.

3. **Screen Requirement for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The program calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons.
     - If `y` is even, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2` is correct because each 2x2 icon fits into one screen.
     - If `y` is odd, `screen_require_for_y = y // 2 + 1` is correct because an additional screen is needed for the remaining 2x2 icon.

4. **Remaining Cells Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the remaining cells after placing all 2x2 icons.
     - `remaining_cells = 15 * screen_require_for_y - space_y` is correct because each screen has 15 cells (5 rows * 3 columns).

5. **Space for 1x1 Icons:**
   - The program checks if the remaining cells can accommodate all 1x1 icons.
     - If `space_x <= remaining_cells`, it means all 1x1 icons can fit in the remaining cells of the current screens.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the additional screens needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.
       - `extra_space = space_x - remaining_cells` is the number of cells left after placing the 2x2 icons.
       - `extra_screen = extra_space // 15 + 1` is correct because each screen has 15 cells, and we need to account for any remainder.

6. **Result Construction:**
   - The program appends the total number of screens needed for each test case to the result list.
   - Finally, it prints the results.

### Conclusion:

The program appears to follow the logic correctly and handles the constraints and requirements of the problem accurately. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
