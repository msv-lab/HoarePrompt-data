Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns nothing.**

Given the constraints, the function does not take any parameters. The description of the output does not provide specific details about what the function returns, but rather describes the range of values for variables `t`, `x`, and `y`. Since the function signature only includes `def func():`, it implies that the function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything based on the given information.
