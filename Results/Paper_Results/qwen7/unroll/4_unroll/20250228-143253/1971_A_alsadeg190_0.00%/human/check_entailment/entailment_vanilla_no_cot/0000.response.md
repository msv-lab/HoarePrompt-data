Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The issue lies in how it processes the test cases. The program reads an integer `x` at the beginning, which should actually be the number of test cases. Then, inside the loop, it reassigns `x` and `y` from the input, but the logic to print the minimum and maximum values is flawed.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Read the number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))  # Read the pair of integers for each test case
        if x > y:
            print(y, x)  # Print the minimum and maximum
        else:
            print(x, y)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of test cases is read first, and then for each test case, it correctly identifies and prints the minimum and maximum values of the pair of integers.
