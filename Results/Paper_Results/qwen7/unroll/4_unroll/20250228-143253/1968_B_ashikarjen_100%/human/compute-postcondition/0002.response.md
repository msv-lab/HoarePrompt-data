Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string representing the input integer n, `b` is the input string from the user**.

Explanation: The code `b = input()` assigns the input value from the user to the variable `b`. Since `n` is an input integer, `a` is a string representing `n`, and `t` is an integer within the specified range, these values remain unchanged. The new variable `b` is assigned the input string from the user.
