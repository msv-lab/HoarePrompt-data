Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an integer obtained from the first integer input, m is an integer obtained from the second integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the input using `input().split()` and then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This means `n` and `m` are now assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and no operations were performed on it.
