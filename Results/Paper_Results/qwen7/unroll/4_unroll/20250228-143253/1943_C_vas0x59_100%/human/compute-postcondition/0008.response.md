Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3, `u2vs` is a list of n lists where each list contains up to n-1 elements representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)`, `d` is the result of the BFS starting from index 0, `d` is now updated with the result of the BFS, and `previous` is a variable holding the previous node information from the BFS.**

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the result of calling `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `a` was previously assigned the result of `func_1(d)`, both `a` and `b` now hold the same value, which is the result of `func_1(d)`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
