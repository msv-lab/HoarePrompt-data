Output State: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^3; `u2vs` is a list of n lists, where each list contains up to n-1 elements representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs (u, v) entered during the loop iterations. Each connection (u, v) adds both `v` to `u2vs[u]` and `u` to `u2vs[v]`.
