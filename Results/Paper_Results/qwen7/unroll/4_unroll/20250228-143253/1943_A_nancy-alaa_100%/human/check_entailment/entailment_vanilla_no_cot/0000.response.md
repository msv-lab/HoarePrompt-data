Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly simulate the game between Alice and Bob as described. Here’s why:

1. **Game Logic**: The program does not simulate the turns of Alice and Bob as specified. Instead, it tries to find the MEX of the array directly without considering whose turn it is or how many elements each player can pick.

2. **Turns Not Considered**: The program assumes that the first occurrence of a unique number (when `mpp[i] == 1`) is picked by Alice, and subsequent occurrences are picked by Bob. However, the actual game requires alternating turns, and the number of turns (which affects the MEX) must be considered.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The solution should account for the fact that Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. This means the program needs to simulate the optimal moves for both players.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to simulate the game properly, ensuring that Alice and Bob make their optimal moves according to the rules. Here’s a more appropriate approach:

```python
def game_score(n, arr):
    # Sort the array to facilitate the game simulation
    sorted_arr = sorted(set(arr))
    
    # Initialize counters for Alice and Bob's turns
    alice_turn = True
    mex = 0
    
    # Simulate the game
    for num in sorted_arr:
        if alice_turn and num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif not alice_turn and num > mex:
            mex += 1
        alice_turn = not alice_turn
    
    return mex

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(game_score(n, arr))

func()
```

This code simulates the game correctly by alternating between Alice and Bob and updating the MEX value accordingly.
