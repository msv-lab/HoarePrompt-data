Postcondition: `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters, `n` is the length of the input string `s`, and `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to -1. If `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns False, the function continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function continues as specified in the else part. Specifically, if `x` is either 1 or half the length of `s`, the function continues as specified in the if part. Otherwise, the function continues as specified in the else part.
