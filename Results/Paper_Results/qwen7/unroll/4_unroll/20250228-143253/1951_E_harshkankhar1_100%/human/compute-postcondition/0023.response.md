Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string consisting of lowercase Latin characters.
- `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character, or -1 if all characters in `s` are the same. In this case, `x` is not equal to -1, meaning there is at least one character in `s` that does not match the first character.
- `func_1(s[x + 1:])` returns `True`, implying that the substring starting from `s[x + 1]` to the end of `s` satisfies some condition checked by `func_1`.
- `x` is neither equal to 1 nor equal to half the length of `s`.

Given these conditions, the print statement `print('YES')` will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
