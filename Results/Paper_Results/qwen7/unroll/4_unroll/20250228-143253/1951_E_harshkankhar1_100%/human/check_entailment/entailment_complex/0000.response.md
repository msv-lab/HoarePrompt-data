Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if the string is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.
   - The function is correctly implemented and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function processes the input string `s` and determines if it can be partitioned into substrings that are not palindromes.
   - It handles three main cases:
     - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome (`func_1(s) == False`), it prints "YES", 1, and the string itself.
     - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character of the string.
     - If such a character is found, it checks if the substring starting from this character is not a palindrome.
       - If the substring is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", 2, and the two substrings.
       - If the substring is a palindrome, it further checks specific conditions related to the position of the character `x`.
         - If `x` is 1 or half the length of the string, it prints "NO".
         - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the two substrings.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

3. **Main Program**:
   - The main loop calls `func_2()` for each test case.
   - The logic in `func_2()` correctly identifies whether the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and prints the appropriate output.

Given the problem statement and the provided annotations, the logic in `func_2()` aligns with the requirements of the problem. The function correctly identifies whether a string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings and handles all edge cases as described.

Correctness: **True**
