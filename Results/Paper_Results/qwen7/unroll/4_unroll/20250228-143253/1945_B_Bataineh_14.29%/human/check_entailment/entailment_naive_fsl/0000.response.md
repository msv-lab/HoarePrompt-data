Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously. The logic in the program fails to account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations properly.

Consider the following example:
- \( a = 3 \)
- \( b = 4 \)
- \( m = 10 \)

According to the problem description, we need to find the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. Let's analyze the sequence of launches:

- First installation launches fireworks at times: \( 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, \ldots \)
- Second installation launches fireworks at times: \( 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, \ldots \)

Fireworks are visible for \( m + 1 = 11 \) minutes. We need to check the overlaps:

- At \( t = 0 \): Both installations launch fireworks.
- At \( t = 3 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 4 \): Only the second installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 6 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 8 \): Only the second installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 9 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 12 \): Both installations launch fireworks.
- At \( t = 15 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 16 \): Only the second installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 18 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 20 \): Only the second installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 21 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 24 \): Both installations launch fireworks.
- At \( t = 27 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 28 \): Only the second installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 30 \): Only the first installation launches fireworks.
- At \( t = 32 \): Only the second installation launches fireworks.

From the above analysis, we see that the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is 3 (at \( t = 0, 12, 24 \)).

However, the program incorrectly prints \( 2 \) in this case because it uses the formula \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \), which does not account for the overlapping fireworks correctly.

Thus, the program does not handle the problem correctly for all potential cases.
