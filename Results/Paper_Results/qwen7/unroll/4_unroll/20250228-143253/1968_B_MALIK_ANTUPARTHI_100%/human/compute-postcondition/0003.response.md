Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an input integer, each iteration of the outer loop processes a pair of strings (d and e) and an integer (c) from user input, calculates the value of k based on the conditions given, and prints the final value of k after completing all iterations of the inner loop. The final state of t and a remains unchanged, while the values of d, e, c, and k are determined by the input during each iteration of the outer loop.
