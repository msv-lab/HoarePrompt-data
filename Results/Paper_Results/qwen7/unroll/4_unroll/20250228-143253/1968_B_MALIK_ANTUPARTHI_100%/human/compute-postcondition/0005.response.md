Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `d` and `e`, and an integer `c`. For each test case, it finds the minimum index `k` such that the first `b` characters of string `d` can be found in string `e` starting from index `k`. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the value of `k` for each case. The function does not modify the input parameters `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` except for calculating and printing `k`.**
