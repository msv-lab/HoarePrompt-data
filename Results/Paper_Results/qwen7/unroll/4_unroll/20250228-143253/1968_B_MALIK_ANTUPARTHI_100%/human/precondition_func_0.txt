t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and two binary strings a and b are provided where the length of a is n and the length of b is m. It is guaranteed that the sum of all n values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
