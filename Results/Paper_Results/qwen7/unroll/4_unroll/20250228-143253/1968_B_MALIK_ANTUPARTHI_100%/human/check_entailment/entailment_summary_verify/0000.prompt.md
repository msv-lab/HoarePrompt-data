You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `d` and `e`, and an integer `c`. For each test case, it finds the minimum index `k` such that the first `b` characters of string `d` can be found in string `e` starting from index `k`. If no such index exists, it prints `-1`. After processing all test cases, it outputs the value of `k` for each case. The function does not modify the input parameters `t`, `a`, `n`, `m`, `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e` except for calculating and printing `k`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not properly check if the prefix of string `a` up to length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
2
5 4
10011
1110
3 5
100
11010
```
- Expected Output:
```
2
3
```
- Actual Output:
```
2
3
```

The program fails to correctly identify the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. For the second test case, the program incorrectly identifies the length as 3, whereas the correct answer should be 2 because "100" is not a subsequence of "11010", but "10" is.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it correctly checks each character of `a` against the remaining part of `b` to see if it forms a subsequence. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.
