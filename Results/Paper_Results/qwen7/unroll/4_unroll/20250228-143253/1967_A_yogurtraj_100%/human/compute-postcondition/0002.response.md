Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}. The list a contains n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}, representing the number of cards of type i after redistributing the cards according to the given algorithm. The final value of r is determined based on the redistribution process, and the final output prints the total count of cards after redistribution.
