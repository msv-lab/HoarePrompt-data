Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes four parameters: two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two non-negative integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`. If found, it returns the index of this occurrence relative to `b[j]` added to `j`. If not found, it returns `-1`.**
