Output State: **`index` is the index of the first occurrence of `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]`; `a` and `b` are binary strings, `i` and `j` are non-negative integers representing the current indices being compared in strings `a` and `b` respectively, such that 0 <= `i` <= len(`a`) and 0 <= `j` <= len(`b`).**

Explanation: The code `index = b[j:].find(a[i])` finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. This value is assigned to the variable `index`. The values of `a`, `b`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged from their initial states.
