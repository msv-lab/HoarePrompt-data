Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Sum**: The formula used to calculate `sum` is incorrect. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix elements through specific operations, not through a mathematical formula. The current implementation calculates a sum that does not correspond to the desired outcome of the operations.

2. **Operations Description**: The operations described in the code do not align with the problem requirements. Specifically, the operations are not correctly setting up the matrix to achieve the maximum possible sum. The operations are simply setting rows and columns to permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]`, which does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix.

3. **Objective Misalignment**: The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations, but the provided solution does not achieve this. The operations described do not ensure that the sum is maximized.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to understand how to strategically apply the operations to set up the matrix such that the sum is maximized. The current approach does not address the strategic placement required to achieve the maximum sum.
