Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The program attempts to calculate a sum and perform operations, but it does not actually maximize the sum of the matrix as required. Instead, it seems to be calculating a sum based on a formula that does not relate to the operations described in the problem statement.

To properly solve the problem, the program should:
1. Perform up to 2n operations to set the values in the matrix such that each element \(a_{i,j}\) is set to \(j\) for Type 1 operations and \(i\) for Type 2 operations.
2. Ensure that after these operations, the sum of all elements in the matrix is maximized.

The current implementation calculates a sum using a formula that does not align with the operations allowed and does not ensure that the matrix is filled according to the specified rules. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
