Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**.

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial condition that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500` remains valid, and the value of `n` is yet to be defined and thus not affected by this code snippet.
