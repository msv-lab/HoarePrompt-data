### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires maximizing the sum of an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation either permutes the elements of a row or a column.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, which is the size of the matrix.
   - The variable `sum` is initialized to 1, and then it attempts to calculate a sum using a loop. However, the calculation inside the loop is incorrect and does not relate to the problem's requirements.
   - The program prints `sum` and `2n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations, respectively.
   - Two operations are printed for each row (or column), but these operations do not seem to follow the problem's constraints correctly.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to fill the matrix with the values 1 through \(n^2\) in such a way that the sum is maximized.
   - We can achieve this by performing \(n\) row operations and \(n\) column operations.
   - Each row operation can set the row to a permutation of the sequence from 1 to \(n\).
   - Each column operation can similarly set the column to a permutation of the sequence from 1 to \(n\).

4. **Verification**:
   - The given program incorrectly calculates `sum` and does not perform the required operations to maximize the sum.
   - The operations printed do not follow the problem's constraints correctly.
   - The program initializes `sum` to 1 and then uses a loop to add terms that do not correspond to the problem's requirements. This results in an incorrect sum.
   - The operations printed are not valid permutations and do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the answer is:

**Final: False**
