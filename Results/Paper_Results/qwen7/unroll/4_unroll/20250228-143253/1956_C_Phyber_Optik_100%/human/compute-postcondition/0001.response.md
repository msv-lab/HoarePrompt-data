State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive, and `_` is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is initialized to 0 before the loop starts, but it will be incremented to 1 after the first iteration. Therefore, we don't need to explicitly adjust its initial value.
- The variable `t` determines whether the loop will execute. Since the loop runs `t` times, `t` must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 to 500) for the loop to execute.

Thus, the state needs to ensure that `t` is within the valid range for the loop to proceed.
