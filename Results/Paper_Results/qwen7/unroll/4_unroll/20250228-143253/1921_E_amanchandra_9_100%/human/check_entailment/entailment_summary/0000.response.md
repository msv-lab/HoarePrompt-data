Reasoning:

1. **Initial Conditions and Input Handling**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly extracts the board dimensions and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.

2. **Key Logic Analysis**:
   - The program checks if `a > c` (Alice's row position is greater than Bob's row position). If true, it prints 'Draw'.
   - If `a <= c`, it calculates the midpoint `x` between Alice's and Bob's row positions.
   - It then checks if the calculated ranges for Alice's and Bob's columns (`l` and `r`) overlap with the other player's column position (`b` and `d` respectively).
   - Based on these conditions, it decides whether Alice or Bob can force a win or if the game results in a draw.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles edge cases where the calculated ranges might extend beyond the board boundaries (ensured by `max(1, ...)` and `min(w, ...)`).
   - The logic correctly accounts for the parity of the distance between Alice and Bob's row positions, which affects the final decision.

4. **Output Validation**:
   - The program's output matches the expected outcomes for the given examples in the execution summary.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the game's outcome based on the provided rules and constraints.

Correctness: **True**
