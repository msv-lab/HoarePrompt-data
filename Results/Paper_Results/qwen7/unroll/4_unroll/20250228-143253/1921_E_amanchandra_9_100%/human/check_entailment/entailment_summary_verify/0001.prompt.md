You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

- Program:
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2

                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)

- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b). For each test case, it determines whether 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' should be printed based on the values of x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b. Specifically, if x_a is greater than x_b, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates a midpoint x and checks if the other coordinates fall within certain ranges with a specified tolerance. Depending on these checks, it prints 'Alice', 'Bob', or 'Draw' for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the board dimensions `r` (rows), `w` (columns), and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` respectively.

2. **Initial Comparison:**
   - The program checks if `a > c`. This comparison is incorrect because it should check if Alice's row position (`a`) is greater than Bob's row position (`c`). Instead, it checks if Alice's column position is greater than Bob's column position, which is irrelevant to the game rules.

3. **Correct Comparison:**
   - The correct condition to check is `a > c`. If `a > c`, it means Alice is initially in a higher row than Bob, and Bob can always move upwards to avoid being captured by Alice. Therefore, the game would end in a draw if Alice starts in a higher row.

4. **Distance Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's and Bob's row positions using `abs(a - c) // 2`. This is a reasonable approach to determine the number of moves required for Bob to reach Alice's row if Alice is in a lower row.

5. **Boundary Checks:**
   - The program calculates the possible column positions for Bob using `l = max(1, b - x)` and `r = min(w, b + x)`. These boundaries ensure that Bob's move stays within the board limits.
   - It then checks if Bob's current column position `b` is within these bounds and if the distance to Alice's column position `d` is within the calculated range.

6. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the distance to Alice's column position is within the calculated range, it prints "Alice" or "Bob" based on the conditions. However, this logic needs to be adjusted to correctly reflect the game rules.

### Corrected Logic:
The corrected logic should consider the following:
- If Alice is in a higher row (`a > c`), the game is a draw.
- If Alice is in a lower row (`a < c`), Bob can always move upwards to avoid being captured by Alice, so the game is a draw.
- If Alice and Bob are in the same row but different columns, the game depends on who can force the other into a position where they cannot move without being captured.

### Revised Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (r, w, a, b, c, d) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if a > c or a == c and b != d:
            print('Draw')
        else:
            x = abs(a - c) // 2
            if abs(a - c) % 2:
                l = max(1, d - x)
                r = min(w, d + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Alice'])[abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1])
            else:
                l = max(1, b - x)
                r = min(w, b + x)
                print(*(['Draw'], ['Bob'])[abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x])

# Since the logic is now correct, the answer is True
Correctness: **True**
```

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the program and making necessary corrections, the final program correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the given rules. Therefore, the program is correct.
