Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', depending on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if `a > c`, it prints 'Draw'. Otherwise, it calculates `x` as half the absolute difference between `a` and `c`. If the absolute difference is odd, it sets `l` and `r` based on `d` and checks if `b` falls within the range `[l, r]` with a tolerance of `x+1`. If so, it prints 'Alice'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'. If the absolute difference is even, it sets `l` and `r` based on `b` and checks if `d` falls within the range `[l, r]` with a tolerance of `x`. If so, it prints 'Bob'; otherwise, it prints 'Draw'.
