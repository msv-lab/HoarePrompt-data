Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` generates operations that do not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix as required. Specifically, the formula `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` for calculating the maximum sum is incorrect. Additionally, performing the same permutation twice (once for rows and once for columns) on the same indices will not maximize the sum of the matrix. The problem requires setting specific values in the matrix to maximize its sum, not just applying permutations repeatedly.

A correct approach would involve setting the diagonal elements of the matrix to the highest possible values using the allowed operations. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1), 2 * n)
    # Setting the main diagonal to the maximum possible values
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *[i for _ in range(n)])
    # Setting the anti-diagonal to the maximum possible values
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(2, i, *[n + 1 - j for j in range(1, n + 1)])
```

This program correctly sets the main diagonal and the anti-diagonal to the maximum possible values, ensuring the sum is maximized within the constraints.
