### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the key points to confirm the correctness of the program:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks and their coordinates and radii.
   - Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` are initialized to store the coordinates and radii.
   - Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are used to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients.
   - `nodes` is used to store nodes during the DFS traversal.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each disk to start a DFS from unvisited disks.
   - During DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent using the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`.
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure that the tangency condition remains true even after decreasing the radii.
   - It then recursively calls DFS on the neighboring disk.
   - After completing the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is non-zero. If so, it means we can reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

3. **Output:**
   - If any DFS results in a non-zero `coef1` sum, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Tangency Condition:**
   - The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the distance formula between their centers and their radii.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are processed.

3. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.

4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced by checking the non-zero `coef1` sum.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles the case where disks are tangent and the tangency condition must be preserved.
- It correctly identifies when it is possible to reduce the radii without violating the tangency conditions.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

### Final Answer

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
