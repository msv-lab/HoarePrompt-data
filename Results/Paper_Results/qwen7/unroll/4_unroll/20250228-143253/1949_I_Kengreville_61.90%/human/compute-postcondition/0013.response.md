Output State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef1` is a list of `n` ones, `ok` is True.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, it sets `coef0[i]` to `0`, `coef1[i]` to `1`, and calls the `dfs(i)` function. After the DFS call, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all nodes visited during the DFS traversal and updates the `ok` variable. Since the loop continues to iterate over all indices and marks all nodes as visited, the final state has all `visited` values set to `True`, all `coef0` values set to `0`, and all `coef1` values set to `1`. The `ok` variable becomes `True` because at least one `coef1` value is non-zero.
