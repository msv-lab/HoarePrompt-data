Output State: **visited[j] is True for all j where the condition (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2 is satisfied; coef0[j] and coef1[j] are updated based on the conditions; nodes contains the order of visited nodes during the DFS traversal.**

Explanation: After the loop executes all its iterations, every disk `j` that satisfies the condition `(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2` will have `visited[j]` set to `True`. The `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` values will be updated based on the given formulas. Additionally, the `dfs(j)` function call will add node `j` to the `nodes` list, representing the order of visited nodes during the DFS traversal.
