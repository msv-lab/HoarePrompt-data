Output State: **`nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of `n` None values, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` False values, `coef1` is a list of `n` None values, `ok` is False.**

The variable `ok` is assigned the boolean value `False`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the values of the other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
