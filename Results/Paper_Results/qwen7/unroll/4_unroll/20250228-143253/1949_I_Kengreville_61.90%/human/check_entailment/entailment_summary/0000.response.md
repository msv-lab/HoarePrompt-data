Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in `func_1` and `dfs` correctly solves the problem as described. Let's break down the key aspects:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to check if it's possible to adjust the radii of the disks such that:
   - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
   - No two disks overlap.
   - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Key Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function initializes necessary lists and variables.
   - It iterates over each disk and performs a DFS if the disk hasn't been visited yet.
   - In the DFS, it checks for tangency between disks and adjusts the coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) accordingly.
   - After the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values is non-zero, which indicates that at least one disk was involved in a tangency relationship.

3. **Key Logic in `dfs`**:
   - The DFS function marks the current disk as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - For each unvisited disk that is tangent to the current disk, it updates the coefficients and recursively calls itself.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic in `func_1` ensures that it checks all disks and their tangency relationships.
   - The DFS in `dfs` correctly identifies tangency relationships and updates the coefficients.
   - The final check in `func_1` ensures that if any tangency relationship exists, the answer is 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.

Given the execution summary and the logic described, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. It checks for tangency relationships and ensures that the sum of radii can be decreased without breaking the tangency conditions.

Correctness: **True**
