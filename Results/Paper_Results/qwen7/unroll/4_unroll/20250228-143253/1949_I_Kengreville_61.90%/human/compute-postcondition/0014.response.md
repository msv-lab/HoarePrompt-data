Output State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef1` is a list of `n` ones, `ok` is True.

Explanation: The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, it sets `coef0[i]` to `0`, `coef1[i]` to `1`, initializes an empty list `nodes`, and calls the `dfs(i)` function. After the DFS call, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all nodes in `nodes`. If the sum of `coef1` is not `0`, it sets `ok` to `True`. Since `visited` is set to `True` for each node visited during the DFS, all elements in `visited` will be `True` by the end of the loop. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated according to the conditions inside the loop.
