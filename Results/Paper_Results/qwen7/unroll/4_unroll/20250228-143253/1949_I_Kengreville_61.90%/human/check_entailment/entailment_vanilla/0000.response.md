Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients.
   - `nodes` is used to store nodes during DFS traversal.
   
3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each disk to perform a DFS starting from unvisited disks.
   - During DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent (`(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`).
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure that the tangency condition remains true even after decreasing the radii.
   - It then recursively calls DFS on the neighboring disk.
   - After completing the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is non-zero. If so, it means we can reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

4. **Output:**
   - If any DFS results in a non-zero `coef1` sum, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Tangency Condition:**
   - The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the distance formula between their centers and their radii.
   
2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are processed.
   
3. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.
   
4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced by checking the non-zero `coef1` sum.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles the case where disks are tangent and the tangency condition must be preserved.
- It correctly identifies when it is possible to reduce the radii without violating the tangency conditions.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
