### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`: Number of disks.
   - `x`, `y`, `r`: Lists of disk centers' coordinates and radii.
   - `visited`: Boolean list to track visited disks.
   - `coef0`, `coef1`: Lists to store coefficients for each disk.
   - `nodes`: List to store the order of visited nodes during DFS.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - Iterate over each disk `i` and perform DFS if it hasn't been visited.
   - In the DFS, for each disk `i`, initialize `coef0[i]` to 0 and `coef1[i]` to 1.
   - For each disk `j` that is directly touchable (distance equals the sum of radii), update the coefficients and recursively call DFS on `j`.
   - After the DFS, check if the sum of `coef1` for all nodes in `nodes` is non-zero. If so, set `ok` to `True`.

3. **Output**:
   - Print 'YES' if `ok` is `True`, otherwise print 'NO'.

#### Function `dfs`:
- Marks the current disk as visited.
- Adds the current disk to the `nodes` list.
- Iterates over all disks `j` and updates the coefficients if `j` is directly touchable and not yet visited.

#### Analysis:
1. **Coefficients Update**:
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated based on the condition that the distance between two disks equals the sum of their radii.
   - This ensures that the disks remain tangent after the radius adjustment.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - The DFS ensures that all directly touchable disks are visited and their coefficients are updated.
   - The coefficients are used to check if the sum of all radii can be decreased.

3. **Sum of Radii**:
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sum of all radii strictly decreases. Instead, it checks if there exists at least one pair of tangent disks and updates their coefficients.
   - This approach is insufficient to guarantee that the sum of all radii strictly decreases for all disks.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
4
2 2 2
7 2 3
7 7 2
2 7 3
```

- The disks form a square configuration where each pair of adjacent disks is tangent.
- The program will mark all disks as visited and update their coefficients.
- However, the sum of the radii will not strictly decrease because the adjustments are made based on the tangency condition, not the overall sum.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not ensure that the sum of all radii strictly decreases. It only checks for the existence of tangent pairs and updates their coefficients, which is not sufficient to guarantee the desired outcome.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
