Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the integer `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is not explicitly initialized in the given state.
   - `n` is already provided as an integer.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Initial value of `i`**: Since `i` is not explicitly initialized, it should be set to the starting value of the loop, which is `0`.

5. **Ensure the loop can execute**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` should be `0` and `n` must be greater than `0`.

6. **Other variables**: The other variables (`nodes`, `coef0`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef1`, `ok`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
