### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

#### Input Parsing
- The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.

#### Initialization
- Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
- Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients.
- `nodes` is used to store nodes during DFS traversal.

#### Main Logic
1. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The program iterates through each disk to perform a DFS starting from unvisited disks.
   - During DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent (`(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`).
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure that the tangency condition remains true even after decreasing the radii.
   - It then recursively calls DFS on the neighboring disk.

2. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.
   - Specifically, for each tangent pair `(i, j)`, the program sets `coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]` and `coef1[j] = -coef1[i]`.

3. **Sum of Coefficients:**
   - After completing the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is non-zero. If so, it means we can reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

#### Output
- If any DFS results in a non-zero `coef1` sum, it prints "YES".
- Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Tangency Condition:**
   - The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the distance formula between their centers and their radii.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are processed.

3. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.

4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced by checking the non-zero `coef1` sum.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles the case where disks are tangent and the tangency condition must be preserved.
- It correctly identifies when it is possible to reduce the radii without violating the tangency conditions.

### Annotated Code Validation

- **Initialization:**
  ```python
  n = int(input())
  x = [None] * n
  y = [None] * n
  r = [None] * n
  visited = [False] * n
  coef0 = [None] * n
  coef1 = [None] * n
  nodes = []
  ```

- **Input Parsing:**
  ```python
  for i in range(n):
      x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
  ```

- **DFS Call and Coefficient Update:**
  ```python
  ok = False
  for i in range(n):
      if not visited[i]:
          coef0[i] = 0
          coef1[i] = 1
          nodes = []
          dfs(i)
          c0 = 0
          c1 = 0
          for j in nodes:
              c0 += coef0[j]
              c1 += coef1[j]
          ok = ok or c1 != 0
  ```

- **DFS Function:**
  ```python
  def dfs(i):
      if not visited[i]:
          visited[i] = True
          nodes.append(i)
          for j in range(n):
              dx = x[i] - x[j]
              dy = y[i] - y[j]
              if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                  coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                  coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                  dfs(j)
  ```

### Final Evaluation

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius. The DFS traversal ensures that all connected components are processed, and the coefficient updates maintain the tangency condition.
