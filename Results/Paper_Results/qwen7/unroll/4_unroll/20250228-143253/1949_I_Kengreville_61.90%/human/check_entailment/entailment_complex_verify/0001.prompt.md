You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. If `visited[i]` is `False`, it sets `coef0[i]` to `0`, `coef1[i]` to `1`, initializes an empty list `nodes`, and calls the `dfs(i)` function. After the DFS call, it calculates the sum of `coef0` and `coef1` for all nodes in `nodes`. If the sum of `coef1` is not `0`, it sets `ok` to `True`. Since `visited` is set to `True` for each node visited during the DFS, all elements in `visited` will be `True` by the end of the loop. The values of `x`, `y`, and `r` remain unchanged, and `coef0` and `coef1` are updated according to the conditions inside the loop.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of `n` zeros, `n` is the same input integer, `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of `n` integers, `r` is a list of `n` integers, `visited` is a list of `n` True values, `coef1` is a list of `n` ones, and `ok` is True if the sum of `coef1` for all nodes in `nodes` is not 0, otherwise `ok` is False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a set of disk centers represented by their x and y coordinates and radii. It performs a depth-first search (DFS) on these disks and calculates coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each disk. Based on the sum of `coef1` values obtained from the DFS, it determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO'. The final state includes an empty `nodes` list, `coef0` filled with zeros, `coef1` filled with ones, `visited` marked as `True` for all disks, and `ok` set to `True` if the sum of `coef1` is non-zero, otherwise `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x`, `y`, and `r` are lists of length `n` containing the x-coordinates, y-coordinates, and radii of the disks respectively, and `visited` is a boolean list of length `n` initialized to `False`. `nodes` is a list used to store the order of visited nodes during the DFS traversal, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of length `n` initialized to `0`.
def dfs(i):
    if (not visited[i]) :
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)
            
        #State: visited[j] is True for all j where the condition (r[i] + r[j])
    #State: During the DFS traversal, if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited[j]` will be set to `True` for all `j` where the condition (r[i] + r[j]) holds. Otherwise, no changes occur to the `visited` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function starts a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal from the disk indexed by `i`. During the traversal, it marks all disks that are directly touchable (i.e., their distance equals the sum of their radii) from the current disk as visited and records the order of visited disks in the `nodes` list. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of disks `n` and the coordinates and radii of each disk.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Arrays `x`, `y`, and `r` store the coordinates and radii of the disks.
   - Arrays `visited`, `coef0`, and `coef1` are initialized to keep track of visited nodes and coefficients.
   - `nodes` is used to store nodes during DFS traversal.
   
3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates through each disk to perform a DFS starting from unvisited disks.
   - During DFS, it checks if two disks are tangent (`(r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2`).
   - If two disks are tangent, it updates the coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` to ensure that the tangency condition remains true even after decreasing the radii.
   - It then recursively calls DFS on the neighboring disk.
   - After completing the DFS, it checks if the sum of `coef1` values for the current node and its neighbors is non-zero. If so, it means we can reduce the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

4. **Output:**
   - If any DFS results in a non-zero `coef1` sum, it prints "YES".
   - Otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Tangency Condition:**
   - The program correctly identifies tangent disks using the distance formula between their centers and their radii.
   
2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS ensures that all connected components (sets of tangent disks) are processed.
   
3. **Coefficient Update:**
   - The coefficients `coef0` and `coef1` are updated correctly to maintain the tangency condition.
   
4. **Sum of Radii:**
   - The program ensures that the sum of radii can be reduced by checking the non-zero `coef1` sum.

### Edge Cases

- The program handles the case where disks are tangent and the tangency condition must be preserved.
- It correctly identifies when it is possible to reduce the radii without violating the tangency conditions.

### Conclusion

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to change the radii of the disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total radius.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
