Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `right + 1` to the variable `big_element`. All other variables (`left`, `right`, `clique`, and `small_element`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
