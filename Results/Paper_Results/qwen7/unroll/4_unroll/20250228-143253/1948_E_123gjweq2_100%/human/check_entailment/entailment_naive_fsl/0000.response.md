Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly assign values to the vertices `a_i` such that the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is satisfied for all pairs `(i, j)` that are connected by an edge.

Here's a specific case where the program fails:

Consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 4`. According to the problem description, we need to assign distinct integers from 1 to 4 to the vertices such that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

The program assigns the values as follows:
- For `cliques = 1`, the array `arr` is filled with values from 1 to 4 in a way that does not necessarily satisfy the condition for all pairs `(i, j)`.

Let's manually check the condition for the assignment `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- For vertices 1 and 2: `|1-2| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2 <= 4` (satisfied)
- For vertices 1 and 3: `|1-3| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4 <= 4` (satisfied)
- For vertices 1 and 4: `|1-4| + |1-1| = 3 + 0 = 3 <= 4` (satisfied)
- For vertices 2 and 3: `|2-3| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 <= 4` (satisfied)
- For vertices 2 and 4: `|2-4| + |2-2| = 2 + 0 = 2 <= 4` (satisfied)
- For vertices 3 and 4: `|3-4| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 = 1 <= 4` (satisfied)

However, the program assigns the same clique value `1` to all vertices, which means all vertices are in the same clique. This is not necessarily the minimum number of cliques required for the given `n` and `k`.

A correct solution would involve more sophisticated logic to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. The current implementation does not guarantee this, hence it is incorrect.
