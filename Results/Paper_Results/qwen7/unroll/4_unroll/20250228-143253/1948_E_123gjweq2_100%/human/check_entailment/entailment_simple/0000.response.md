Reasoning:
1. The problem requires creating a graph and partitioning it into the minimum possible number of cliques based on certain conditions.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this by:
   - Calculating the number of cliques needed (`cliques = ceil(n / k)`).
   - Initializing arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with appropriate lengths.
   - Calling `make_array` for each clique to populate `arr` and `cliquess`.
   - Printing the results in the required format.

3. The `make_array` function:
   - Takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as arguments.
   - Divides the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns values to `arr` and `cliquess` accordingly.

4. The logic in `make_array`:
   - Sets the first half of the range to increasing values starting from `small_element`.
   - Sets the second half of the range to decreasing values starting from `big_element`.

5. The overall approach:
   - Ensures that each vertex gets a unique value from 1 to n.
   - Creates a partition of the graph into the minimum number of cliques.
   - The values in `arr` and `cliquess` ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the calculated number of cliques.

6. Given the constraints and the logic used, the code appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
