Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`**.

Explanation: The code calculates `not_mid` as `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given the initial values of `left`, `right`, and `mid`, `not_mid` is computed directly from these values. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
