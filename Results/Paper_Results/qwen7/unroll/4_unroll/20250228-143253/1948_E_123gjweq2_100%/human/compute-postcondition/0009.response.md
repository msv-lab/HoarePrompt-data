Output State: `left` is an integer such that `left` < `right` and both are within the range [0, n-1], `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`, `arr` is modified such that for each `i` in the range `[0, not_mid)`, `arr[left + mid + i]` is set to `big_element - i` and `cliquess[left + mid + i]` is set to `clique`.
