Reasoning:

1. The problem statement requires determining if it's possible to have exactly `m` cubes in the tower after `n` moves, where each move adds or removes exactly one cube.
2. The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - It checks if `b == c`, which is not the correct condition. The condition should check if `n` operations can result in `m` cubes, which means checking if `n` is sufficient to reach `m` cubes.
   - It incorrectly uses `a % 2 == b % 2` as a condition, which is irrelevant to the problem.
   - It does not account for the fact that adding and removing cubes can balance out to achieve the desired `m` cubes.

The correct logic should be:
- If `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` is even (since each pair of add and remove cancels out), then it's possible to end up with `m` cubes.
- Otherwise, it's not possible.

Given the provided solution does not follow this logic, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
