Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, where n and m are derived from a test case with a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100). It returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

This means the function indirectly accepts two parameters `n` and `m` through a test case involving a positive integer `t`, and returns a value determined by comparing `n` and `m`.
