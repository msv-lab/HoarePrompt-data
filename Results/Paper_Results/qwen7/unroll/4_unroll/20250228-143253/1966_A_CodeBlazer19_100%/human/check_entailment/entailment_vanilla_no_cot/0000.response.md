Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Cards**: The code counts the occurrences of each unique card using `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]`. However, this approach does not account for the possibility of reducing the count of cards through the allowed operations.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Maximum Card Count**: The logic checks if the maximum count of any card (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k` and prints `k - 1` if true. This is incorrect because the goal is to minimize the number of cards, not just check if the maximum count is large enough to perform an operation.

3. **Missing Key Logic**: The solution lacks the necessary logic to determine the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the operations optimally. Specifically, it does not handle cases where multiple operations can be performed to reduce the total number of cards more effectively.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to consider the following:

1. **Count Occurrences**: Count the occurrences of each card.
2. **Determine Minimum Cards**: For each unique card, determine how many operations can be performed to reduce its count. The key insight is that you can always reduce the count of a card by `k-1` for each operation, but you must ensure that the remaining count is less than `k`.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        count = {}
        
        # Count occurrences of each card
        for card in l:
            if card in count:
                count[card] += 1
            else:
                count[card] = 1
        
        min_cards = n
        for c in count.values():
            # Perform operations until the count is less than k
            while c >= k:
                c -= (k - 1)
            min_cards = min(min_cards, c)
        
        print(min_cards + len(count))
```

This approach ensures that you correctly calculate the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the allowed operations optimally.
