Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers, each representing either `k - 1` or `n`. For each iteration of the loop, if the maximum frequency of any number in the list `l` is greater than or equal to `k`, the output will be `k - 1`; otherwise, it will be `n`. The number of outputs will be equal to the value of `t`.
