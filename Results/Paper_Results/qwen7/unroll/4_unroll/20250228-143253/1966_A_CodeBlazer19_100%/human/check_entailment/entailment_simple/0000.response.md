### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is consistent with the problem statement.

2. **Card Counting**: The program uses a list comprehension to count the occurrences of each unique card value in the list `l`. This is a correct approach to determine how many cards of each type are present.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the maximum frequency of any card value (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `max(p) >= k`, the logic correctly reduces the number of cards by `k - 1` because we can always exchange `k` cards of the same type for `k - 1` new cards.
   - When `max(p) < k`, the logic correctly prints `n` because no exchanges can be made, and thus the total number of cards remains unchanged.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the correct result for each test case based on the logic described.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement.

### Correctness:
**True**
