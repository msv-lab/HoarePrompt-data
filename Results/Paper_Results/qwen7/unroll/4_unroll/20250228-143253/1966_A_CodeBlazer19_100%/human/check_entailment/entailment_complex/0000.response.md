Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations any number of times.
2. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`, and the list of card numbers `c`.
3. The program then calculates the frequency of each unique number in the list `c` using a list comprehension that counts occurrences of each unique number.
4. The logic checks if the maximum frequency of any number in the list is greater than or equal to `k`. If true, it prints `k - 1`, indicating that we can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1` by performing the operations optimally. Otherwise, it prints `n`, meaning no operations can reduce the number of cards further.
5. The logic aligns with the problem statement and examples provided. For instance, if the maximum frequency is less than `k`, the output should be `n` because we cannot perform any exchanges. If the maximum frequency is greater than or equal to `k`, the output should be `k - 1` because we can always exchange `k` cards of the most frequent number to get `k - 1` new cards.

Given the analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
