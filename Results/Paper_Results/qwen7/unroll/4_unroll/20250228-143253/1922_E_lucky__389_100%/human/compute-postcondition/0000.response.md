Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, x is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `x = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `x`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the input is only read for `x`. Therefore, `t` retains its initial state as a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` is assigned the value of the input provided by the user.
