Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `z` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (inclusive).
   - `t` is set to the integer value of input() at the start of the program.
3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs as long as `z < t`.
4. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - The variable `z` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: `t` must be greater than 0, `z` is 0**
