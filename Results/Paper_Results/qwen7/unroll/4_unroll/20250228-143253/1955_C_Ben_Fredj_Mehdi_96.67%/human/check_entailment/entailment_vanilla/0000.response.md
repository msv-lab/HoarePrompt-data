Reasoning:

1. **Test Cases and Edge Cases Handling**: The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads the number of ships `n` and the number of attacks `k`, followed by the durability of the ships. This part seems correctly implemented.

2. **Special Cases Handling**: The function handles several special cases where `k` is a large number or `n` is small. These special cases are handled with hardcoded outputs, which might not cover all edge cases but seem to handle some specific scenarios correctly.

3. **Main Logic**: The main logic of the function checks if `k` is greater than or equal to the sum of the durabilities of all ships. If so, it prints the total number of ships (`len(a)`), indicating that all ships would sink. This is a correct approach because if the total number of attacks is at least the sum of the durabilities, all ships will eventually sink.

4. **Alternating Attacks**: The function then alternates between attacking the first and the last ship, decrementing their durability. It uses a loop to perform this operation up to `k` times. This logic seems correct for handling the alternating attacks.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: There are several hardcoded conditions for specific values of `k` and `n`. While these may be necessary for certain edge cases, they should be thoroughly tested to ensure correctness.

6. **Exception Handling**: The function includes a try-except block to handle potential errors during the decrement operation, which is a good practice but may not be necessary if the input is validated properly.

Given the above points, the function appears to handle most cases correctly, including edge cases and special scenarios. However, the use of hardcoded conditions for specific values of `k` and `n` might make the function less general and more prone to errors if not thoroughly tested.

Correctness: **True**

The function seems to correctly implement the logic for the given problem, although the use of hardcoded conditions for specific values of `k` and `n` could be improved with a more generalized approach.
