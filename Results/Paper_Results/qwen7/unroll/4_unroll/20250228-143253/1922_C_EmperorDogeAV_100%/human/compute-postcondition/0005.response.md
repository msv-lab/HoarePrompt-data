Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `cities`, which is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of cities in ascending order, and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. The function returns a list `prog_cities` where the first and last elements are 0, and each element in between is either 1 or the absolute difference between the corresponding city's coordinate and its adjacent city's coordinate in the `cities` list.**
