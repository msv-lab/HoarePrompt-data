cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (0 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 10^9), n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and there are m queries, where each query consists of two distinct integers x_i and y_i representing the indices of the cities to calculate the minimum number of coins to travel between them (1 ≤ x_i, y_i ≤ n, x_i ≠ y_i).
