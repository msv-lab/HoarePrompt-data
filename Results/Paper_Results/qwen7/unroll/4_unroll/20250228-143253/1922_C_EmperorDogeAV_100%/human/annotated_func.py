#State of the program right berfore the function call: cities is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order (i.e., 0 <= cities[0] < cities[1] < ... < cities[n-1]), n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and the list of queries consists of pairs of distinct indices (x_i, y_i) where 1 <= x_i, y_i <= n.
def func_1(cities, n):
    prog_cities = [0] * (n - 1)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        back = -99999999999999999999
        
        forward = 999999999999999999

    #State: Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of the cities in ascending order, `prog_cities` is a list where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the forward and backward city coordinates, starting from the second city to the second last city. The first and last elements of `prog_cities` remain 0.
    return prog_cities
    #`prog_cities` is a list where the first and last elements are 0, and each element in between is either 1 or the absolute difference between the corresponding city's coordinate and its adjacent city's coordinate in the `cities` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of city coordinates (`cities`) in ascending order and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a new list (`prog_cities`) where the first and last elements are 0, and each element in between is either 1 or the absolute difference between the corresponding city's coordinate and its adjacent city's coordinate in the original `cities` list.
