You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n cities located on the number line, the i -th city is in the point
a_i . The coordinates of the cities are given in ascending order, so a_1 < a_2
< \dots < a_n .

The distance between two cities x and y is equal to |a_x - a_y| .

For each city i , let's define the closest city j as the city such that the
distance between i and j is not greater than the distance between i and each
other city k . For example, if the cities are located in points [0, 8, 12, 15,
20] , then:

  * the closest city to the city 1 is the city 2 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 2 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 3 is the city 4 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 4 is the city 3 ; 
  * the closest city to the city 5 is the city 4 . 

The cities are located in such a way that for every city, the closest city is
unique. For example, it is impossible for the cities to be situated in points
[1, 2, 3] , since this would mean that the city 2 has two closest cities (1
and 3 , both having distance 1 ).

You can travel between cities. Suppose you are currently in the city x . Then
you can perform one of the following actions:

  * travel to any other city y , paying |a_x - a_y| coins; 
  * travel to the city which is the closest to x , paying 1 coin. 

You are given m queries. In each query, you will be given two cities, and you
have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from
one city to the other city.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case is given in the following format:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^5 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_1 < a_2 < \dots < a_n \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains one integer m (1 \le m \le 10^5 ); 
  * then m lines follow; the i -th of them contains two integers x_i and y_i (1 \le x_i, y_i \le n ; x_i \ne y_i ), denoting that in the i -th query, you have to calculate the minimum number of coins you have to spend to travel from the city x_i to the city y_i . 

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, for each city, the closest city is determined uniquely; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 ; 
  * the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 10^5 . 

Output

For each query, print one integer — the minimum number of coins you have to
spend.

Example

Input

    1
    
    5
    
    0 8 12 15 20
    
    5
    
    1 4
    
    1 5
    
    3 4
    
    3 2
    
    5 1

Output

    3
    8
    1
    4
    14
    
Note

Let's consider the first two queries in the example from the statement:

  * in the first query, you are initially in the city 1 . You can travel to the closest city (which is the city 2 ), paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 3 ) again, paying 1 coin. Then you travel to the closest city (which is the city 4 ) again, paying 1 coin. In total, you spend 3 coins to get from the city 1 to the city 4 ; 
  * in the second query, you can use the same way to get from the city 1 to the city 4 , and then spend 5 coins to travel from the city 4 to the city 5 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum cost to travel between any two cities.
   - The cost to travel directly between two cities \(x\) and \(y\) is \(|a_x - a_y|\).
   - The cost to travel to the closest city is always 1 coin.
   - The closest city to a city \(i\) is unique and can be found using the `func_1` function.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case separately.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cities, their positions, and the number of queries.
   - It then calculates the "forward" and "backward" distances to the closest city using the `func_1` function.
   - It computes prefix sums for these distances.
   - Finally, it processes each query to determine the minimum cost to travel between the given cities.

3. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the distance to the closest city for each city.
   - It iterates through each city and determines the closer of the two neighboring cities.
   - If the forward city is closer, it sets the value to 1 (cost to travel to the closest city); otherwise, it sets it to the distance to the forward city.

4. **Prefix Sums:**
   - Prefix sums are calculated for both forward and backward distances.
   - These are used to quickly compute the sum of distances for any range of cities.

5. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the code uses the prefix sums to find the minimum cost.
   - If the starting city index is less than the ending city index, it uses the forward prefix sum; otherwise, it uses the backward prefix sum.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where the starting and ending indices are reversed correctly by using the appropriate prefix sum array.

7. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for finding the closest city and calculating the prefix sums seems correct.
   - The query processing logic also appears to be correct, using the appropriate prefix sums.

Given the analysis, the provided code seems to correctly implement the solution for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
