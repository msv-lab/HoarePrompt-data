Functionality: **The function accepts a list of city coordinates (`cities`) in ascending order and an integer `n` indicating the number of cities. It returns a new list (`prog_cities`) where the first and last elements are 0, and each element in between is either 1 or the absolute difference between the corresponding city's coordinate and its adjacent city's coordinate in the original `cities` list.**
