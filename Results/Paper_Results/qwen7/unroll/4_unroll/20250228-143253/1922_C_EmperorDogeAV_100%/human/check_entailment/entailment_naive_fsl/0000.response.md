Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city. The `func_1` function is intended to determine the closest city to each city in the list, but it does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. Specifically, the logic inside `func_1` does not properly handle the case where the closest city is neither the previous nor the next city in the list. 

For example, consider the input:
- Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
- Query: `(1, 3)`

The expected closest city to city 1 is city 2, and the expected closest city to city 3 is city 4. However, the current implementation may incorrectly determine the closest city, leading to incorrect results. This can be seen in the example output provided, where the distances do not match the expected values based on the closest city rule.
