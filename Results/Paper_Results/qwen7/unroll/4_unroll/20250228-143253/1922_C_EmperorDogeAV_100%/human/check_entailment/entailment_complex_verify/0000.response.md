### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to understand its behavior and verify if it correctly implements the logic for finding the minimum number of coins required to travel between cities.

#### Step 1: Input Parsing
- The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
- For each test case:
  - It reads the number of cities `n`.
  - It reads the coordinates of the cities into a list `cities`.
  - It reverses the list `cities` and calls `func_1` to compute `backward_cities`.
  - It computes prefix sums for `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.

#### Step 2: Function `func_1`
- The function `func_1` is supposed to determine the closest city to each city in the list.
- The logic inside `func_1` is flawed because it only checks the immediate neighbors (previous and next cities) and does not handle more distant cities that could be closer.
- For example, consider the input:
  - Cities: `[0, 8, 12, 15, 20]`
  - The function will set `prog_cities` as follows:
    - `prog_cities[0] = 1` (since `abs(8 - 0) < abs(20 - 0)` is false)
    - `prog_cities[1] = 1` (since `abs(12 - 8) < abs(20 - 8)` is false)
    - `prog_cities[2] = 1` (since `abs(15 - 12) < abs(20 - 12)` is false)
    - `prog_cities[3] = 1` (since `abs(20 - 15) < abs(0 - 15)` is true)
  - This is incorrect because the closest city to city 1 is city 2, and the closest city to city 3 is city 4.

#### Step 3: Prefix Sum Computation
- The program computes prefix sums for `forward_cities` and `backward_cities`.
- These prefix sums are used to quickly compute the minimum number of coins required to travel between any two cities.

#### Step 4: Query Processing
- For each query, the program determines the minimum number of coins required to travel from city `a` to city `b` using the prefix sums.

Given the above analysis, the `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for the queries.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because the `func_1` function does not correctly identify the closest city for each city, leading to incorrect results for the queries.
