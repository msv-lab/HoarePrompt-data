Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. For each test case, it calculates the total number of pairs (or nearly pairs) that can be formed from these counts and prints the result. After processing all test cases, it outputs the sum of these results.**
