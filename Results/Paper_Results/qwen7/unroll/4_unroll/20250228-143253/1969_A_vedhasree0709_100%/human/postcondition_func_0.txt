The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (size of the permutation list), and a list \( p \) of length \( n \) containing distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) excluding the index itself. For each test case, it checks if there exists an index \( i \) such that \( p[i] \) equals \( i + 1 \). If such an index is found, it outputs 2; otherwise, it outputs 3. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.
