Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the program fails to consider scenarios where no pair of friends can mutually invite each other. For example, in the input `2 1`, the program incorrectly prints `3` instead of `2`. Here, sending invitations to both friends 1 and 2 would ensure that both attend the party. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario and always prints `2` or `3` without checking all possible pairs.
