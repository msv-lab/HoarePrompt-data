Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly handle all cases where at least 2 friends need to be invited to ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party. Here are some issues with the current implementation:

1. **Logic for Finding Pairs**: The logic to find pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and can be invited with just 2 invitations is flawed. The code only checks if `q == i + 1` which is not sufficient. For example, in the case `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, it should identify that friends 4 and 5 can be invited together, but the current logic does not catch this.

2. **Handling Single Cycle Cases**: The code does not handle cases where there is a single cycle involving more than 2 friends. In such cases, inviting 3 friends might be necessary. For example, in the case `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, the code incorrectly prints 2 instead of 3.

3. **General Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The solution needs to consider all possible cycles and chains in the best friend relationships to determine the minimum number of invitations needed.

To fix these issues, we need to properly identify cycles and chains in the best friend relationships and calculate the minimum number of invitations accordingly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    def min_invitations(n, p):
        visited = [False] * n
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                cycle_size = 0
                j = i
                while not visited[j]:
                    visited[j] = True
                    j = p[j - 1] - 1
                    cycle_size += 1
                if cycle_size > 2:
                    count += (cycle_size + 1) // 2
                elif cycle_size == 2:
                    count += 1
        return count

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().split()))
        print(min_invitations(n, p))

func()
```

This solution works as follows:
- It uses a helper function `min_invitations` to calculate the minimum number of invitations needed.
- It iterates through each friend and tracks visited friends to detect cycles.
- For each cycle detected, it calculates the minimum number of invitations required based on the size of the cycle.
- Finally, it prints the result for each test case.
