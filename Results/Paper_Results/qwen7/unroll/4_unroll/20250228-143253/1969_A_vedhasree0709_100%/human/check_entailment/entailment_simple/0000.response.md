Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
2. The logic inside the loop checks only one pair of friends `(i, p[i])` to see if they are best friends with each other (`q == i + 1`). This is insufficient because it does not consider all possible pairs of friends.
3. The code assumes that if a single pair of friends is found where both have received invitations, then the answer is `2`. However, this is not always true. For example, in the second test case, the code would incorrectly output `2` instead of `3`.
4. The code also does not handle the case where no such pair exists but a triplet might work, which is why the output should be `3` in some scenarios.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
