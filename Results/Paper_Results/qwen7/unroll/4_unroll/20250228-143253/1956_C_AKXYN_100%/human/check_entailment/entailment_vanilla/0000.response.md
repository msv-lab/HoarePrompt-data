### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the expected maximum sum \( res \) as the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations to ensure each element in the matrix is set to its correct value.

3. **Verification:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1) = n^2 \).
   - The function sets each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( j \) for Type 1 operations and to \( i \) for Type 2 operations, which correctly fills the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \).
   - Each operation is performed exactly once, ensuring the matrix is fully populated without exceeding the limit of \( 2n \) operations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - For larger \( n \), the solution ensures that each element is set to its correct value within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements using at most \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
