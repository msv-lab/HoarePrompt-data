### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the expected maximum sum \( res \) as the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations to ensure each element in the matrix is set to its correct value.

3. **Verification:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1) = n^2 \).
   - The function sets each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( j \) for Type 1 operations and to \( i \) for Type 2 operations, which correctly fills the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \).
   - However, the calculation of the sum \( res \) is incorrect. The correct sum should be the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers, which is \( n^2 \), not the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\).

4. **Correct Calculation of \( res \):**
   - The correct sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( n^2 \).
   - The function should calculate \( res \) as \( n^2 \) instead of the incorrect formula.

5. **Operations:**
   - The operations performed by the function are correct in terms of filling the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \).
   - The function uses \( n \) Type 1 operations and \( n \) Type 2 operations, which is within the limit of \( 2n \) operations.

6. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - For larger \( n \), the solution ensures that each element is set to its correct value within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution is almost correct, but the calculation of the sum \( res \) is incorrect. The correct sum should be \( n^2 \), not the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\).

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
