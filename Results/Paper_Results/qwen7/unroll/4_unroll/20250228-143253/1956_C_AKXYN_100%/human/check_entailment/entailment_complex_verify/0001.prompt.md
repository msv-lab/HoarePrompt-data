You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: Output State: t test cases are printed, each followed by two lines of output. For each test case:
    #1. A line containing the value of `res` and `n << 1`.
    #2. `n` lines, each starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to n.
    #3. `n` lines, each starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to n.
    #
    #The value of `res` is calculated as the sum of `(i + 1) * (2 * i + 1)` for each row `i` in the matrix `mat`, and `n << 1` is equivalent to `2 * n`. The matrix `mat` is a square matrix of size `n x n` filled with numbers from 1 to n in sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)). For each test case, it calculates a value \( res \) as the sum of \((i + 1) \times (2 \times i + 1)\) for each row \( i \) in a square matrix of size \( n \times n \), and prints \( res \) along with \( 2n \). It then prints \( n \) lines starting with '1' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \), and another \( n \) lines starting with '2' followed by numbers from 1 to \( n \).


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements in a specific row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements in a specific column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The function initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to \( n \) in each row.
   - It calculates the expected maximum sum \( res \) as the sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers.
   - It prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It performs \( n \) Type 1 operations followed by \( n \) Type 2 operations to ensure each element in the matrix is set to its correct value.

3. **Verification:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) odd numbers is \( 1 + 3 + 5 + \ldots + (2n-1) = n^2 \).
   - The function sets each element \( a_{i,j} \) to \( j \) for Type 1 operations and to \( i \) for Type 2 operations, which correctly fills the matrix with values from 1 to \( n \).
   - Each operation is performed exactly once, ensuring the matrix is fully populated without exceeding the limit of \( 2n \) operations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - For larger \( n \), the solution ensures that each element is set to its correct value within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix elements using at most \( 2n \) operations. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
