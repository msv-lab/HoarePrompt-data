Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is used as a throwaway variable) and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `int(input())` returns a positive integer value within the range specified (1 ≤ n ≤ 500).

3. **Determine the initial state needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter for the loop execution.
   - The key variable here is the result of `int(input())`, which determines whether the loop continues.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since the loop depends on the input from `int(input())`, we need to ensure that the input is within the valid range (1 ≤ n ≤ 500).
   - We don't know the exact value of `t` (the number of test cases), but we know that `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input that will be read by `int(input())` during the first iteration of the loop. This input should be within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`int(input())` must be an integer between 1 and 500, inclusive**
