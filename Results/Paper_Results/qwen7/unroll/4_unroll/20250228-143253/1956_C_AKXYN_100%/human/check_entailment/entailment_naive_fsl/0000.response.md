Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. However, the program simply initializes the matrix with the identity permutation and calculates a sum based on a formula without actually performing the required operations.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple \(2 \times 2\) matrix:

- Initial matrix after setting it with identity permutation:
```
1 2
3 4
```

- Sum of the matrix: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\)

However, according to the problem, the maximum possible sum for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix is 7, which can be achieved by the following operations:

1. Type 1 operation on row 1: Set \(a_{1,1} = 1\), \(a_{1,2} = 2\)
2. Type 2 operation on column 1: Set \(a_{1,1} = 1\), \(a_{2,1} = 2\)
3. Type 1 operation on row 2: Set \(a_{2,1} = 3\), \(a_{2,2} = 4\)

This results in the matrix:
```
1 2
3 4
```

But the program does not perform these operations; instead, it calculates a sum based on a formula that does not reflect the actual operations needed to achieve the maximum sum. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
