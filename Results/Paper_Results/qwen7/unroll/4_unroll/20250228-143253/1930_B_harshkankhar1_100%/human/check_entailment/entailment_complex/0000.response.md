Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by generating a permutation of length \( n \) where no two pairs of consecutive elements satisfy the divisibility condition specified in the problem statement. The approach used in `func_1()` is to create a list of integers from 1 to \( n \), reverse every second element, and then print the resulting list.

Let's analyze the correctness of the solution:

1. **Permutation Generation**: The list `a` is initially created with integers from 1 to \( n \).
2. **Reversing Every Second Element**: By reversing every second element (`a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]`), the function ensures that the odd-indexed elements are in reverse order relative to their original positions. This step helps in breaking the divisibility chain because if \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \), then \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) must be adjacent in the original list but are now separated by at least one element after the reversal.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, this approach should work for generating a valid permutation. Hereâ€™s why:

- **Divisibility Condition**: If \( p_i \) divides \( p_{i+1} \), then in the original list, \( p_i \) and \( p_{i+1} \) were consecutive. After reversing every second element, they are no longer consecutive, thus breaking the divisibility chain.
- **Guaranteed Validity**: Since the problem guarantees that at least one valid permutation exists, and the proposed method ensures that no two consecutive elements satisfy the divisibility condition, it is a valid solution.

Therefore, the given program correctly implements the logic to generate a valid permutation according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
