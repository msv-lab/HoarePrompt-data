### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from 1 to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list starting from the first element (i.e., elements at even indices).
   - Finally, it prints the list `a`.

3. **Permutation Validity**:
   - Let's analyze the permutation generation process more closely:
     - For `n = 4`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
     - Reversing every other element gives `[4, 1, 2, 3]`.
     - We need to check if this permutation satisfies the condition: there do not exist two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i` divides `p_j` and `p_{i+1}` divides `p_{j+1}`.
     - Checking the permutation `[4, 1, 2, 3]`:
       - No pair `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` exists where both pairs satisfy the divisibility condition.
     - For `n = 3`, the list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Reversing every other element gives `[1, 2, 3]`.
     - Checking the permutation `[1, 2, 3]`:
       - No pair `(p_i, p_{i+1})` and `(p_j, p_{j+1})` exists where both pairs satisfy the divisibility condition.
   - The permutation generation logic ensures that the resulting permutation meets the required conditions for all valid `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the constraints correctly, as it only processes up to `10^5` elements in total across all test cases.
   - The permutation generation logic ensures that the resulting permutation meets the required conditions for all valid `n`.

However, there is a critical flaw in the permutation generation logic. Specifically, the approach of reversing every other element starting from the first element does not guarantee that the permutation will always meet the required condition for all `n`.

### Counterexample:
Consider `n = 6`. The list `a` is initially `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
- After reversing every other element, the list becomes `[6, 2, 4, 2, 5, 6]`.
- Checking the permutation `[6, 2, 4, 2, 5, 6]`:
  - `p_1 = 6` and `p_2 = 2`: `6` divides `2` (False).
  - `p_2 = 2` and `p_3 = 4`: `2` divides `4` (True).
  - `p_3 = 4` and `p_4 = 2`: `4` does not divide `2` (False).
  - `p_4 = 2` and `p_5 = 5`: `2` does not divide `5` (False).
  - `p_5 = 5` and `p_6 = 6`: `5` does not divide `6` (False).

The permutation `[6, 2, 4, 2, 5, 6]` fails the condition because `p_2` divides `p_3`.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the permutation generation logic does not guarantee that the generated permutation will always meet the required condition for all `n`. Therefore, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
