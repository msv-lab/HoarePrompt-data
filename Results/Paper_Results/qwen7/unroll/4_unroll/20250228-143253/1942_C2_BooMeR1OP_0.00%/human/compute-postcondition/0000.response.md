Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x.**

The code reads three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the existing values of `n`, `x`, and `y` in the program's state. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the operation.
