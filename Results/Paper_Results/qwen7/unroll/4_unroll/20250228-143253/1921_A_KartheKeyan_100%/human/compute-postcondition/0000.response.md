Output State: **There are four lines of input, each containing two integers \(x_i\), \(y_i\) such that -1000 ≤ \(x_i\), \(y_i\) ≤ 1000. These coordinates represent the corners of a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and a positive area. There are t test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; n is 0; l is an input integer; s is the sum of (l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2 for each test case.**

Explanation: The code reads the number of test cases (`n`) first. Then, it enters a while loop where it processes each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer `l`, calculates `s` using the formula `(l//4) + (l - (4 * (l // 4))) // 2`, and prints `s`. After processing all test cases, `n` is decremented until it reaches 0, meaning all test cases have been processed. The values of `l` and `s` are updated for each test case, but `n` is set to 0 after all test cases are processed.
