### Reasoning

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the given program is correct. Let's break down the issues and provide a detailed analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The conditions for `k > n` and `k == n` are handled correctly. If `k > n`, the program prints `n` because you cannot select `k` cards. If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1` because you can exchange all `n` cards for `n - 1` new cards.

2. **Handling General Case:**
   - The main issue lies in the general case where `k < n`. The program calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of the card numbers. However, the logic to determine the minimum number of cards is flawed.
   - The condition `if k in freq.values()` is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards. Even if `k` is present in the frequency values, it doesn't necessarily mean you can reduce the number of cards to `k - 1`.
   - The program should consider the distribution of card counts and the ability to exchange groups of `k` cards.

3. **Detailed Explanation:**
   - The function `func_1` correctly creates a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`.
   - However, the main logic to determine the minimum number of cards is incorrect. The program should consider the following:
     - For each group of card numbers, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed.
     - The remaining cards that cannot form a full group should be counted as they are the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
1. Group the card numbers by their counts.
2. Determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.

### Corrected Program

```python
from collections import Counter

t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    # Count the frequency of each card number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of cards
    min_cards = sum(v // k for v in freq.values()) * (k - 1) + sum(v % k for v in freq.values())
    
    print(min_cards)
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Count the Frequency:**
   - Use `Counter` to count the frequency of each card number.

2. **Calculate Minimum Cards:**
   - For each group of card numbers, calculate how many full groups of `k` cards can be formed (`v // k`).
   - Multiply by `(k - 1)` to get the number of cards after exchanging.
   - Add the remaining cards that cannot form a full group (`v % k`).

This approach ensures that we correctly determine the minimum number of cards that cannot be reduced further.
