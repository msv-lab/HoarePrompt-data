Output State: The `frequency_table` is a dictionary where each key is a number from the list `arr`, and its value is the maximum of the count of that number in `arr` or `k`. If a number appears more than `k` times in `arr`, its count in `frequency_table` will be set to `k`. All other keys in `frequency_table` are not present if they do not appear in `arr`.
