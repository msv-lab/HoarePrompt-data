Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the specified operations any number of times.
2. The given solution correctly handles the edge cases where \( k > n \) and \( k == n \).
3. The core logic involves counting the occurrences of each number in the list of cards and ensuring no count exceeds \( k \), which is handled by the `func_1` function.
4. The `func_1` function correctly updates the frequency table to ensure that no number's count exceeds \( k \).
5. After processing the frequencies, the program checks if any number's count is exactly \( k \). If so, it prints \( k - 1 \); otherwise, it prints the total number of unique numbers in the original list, which is equivalent to the total number of cards since no further reduction is possible.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
