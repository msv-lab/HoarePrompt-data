### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. If possible, the program should output the number of stalls and their respective prices.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall.
   - We need to ensure that the total number of jewels Alice buys equals `k`.
   - We need to check if it's possible to achieve this with the given constraints.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It defines a function `func_1` to handle the logic for each test case.
   - The function checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - If `n` is less than `k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost for the first stall (`n - k + 1`) and the second stall (`1`). Then it checks if the sum of these stalls is sufficient to buy `k` jewels.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, it prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls with the calculated prices.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - **Case 1**: When `n == k`, the solution correctly prints "YES" and sets up 1 stall with price 1.
   - **Case 2**: When `n < k`, the solution correctly prints "NO".
   - **Case 3**: When `n > k`, the solution calculates the prices for 2 stalls and checks if they can buy exactly `k` jewels. This part is logically sound but needs further validation.

5. **Validation**:
   - Let's analyze the logic for `n > k`:
     - The first stall is priced at `n - k + 1`, meaning Alice can buy `n // (n - k + 1)` jewels from the first stall.
     - The second stall is priced at `1`, meaning Alice can buy `n // 1 = n` jewels from the second stall.
     - The total number of jewels Alice can buy is the sum of the jewels bought from both stalls, which is `n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1`.

   - For the solution to work, the sum of the jewels bought from the stalls must be exactly `k`:
     - If `n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1 >= k`, then the solution is correct.
     - However, this logic only works if the sum of the jewels bought from the stalls is exactly `k`. The current implementation does not guarantee this.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider `n = 10` and `k = 8`:
     - The first stall is priced at `10 - 8 + 1 = 3`, allowing Alice to buy `10 // 3 = 3` jewels.
     - The second stall is priced at `1`, allowing Alice to buy `10 // 1 = 10` jewels.
     - The total number of jewels bought is `3 + 10 = 13`, which is more than `k = 8`.
     - The solution prints "YES" and sets up 2 stalls, but this is incorrect because Alice cannot buy exactly 8 jewels.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels when `n > k`. The logic for setting up the stalls and calculating the prices is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.

### Correctness:
**False**

### Final:
Final: **False**
