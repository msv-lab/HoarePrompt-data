Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Initial State Description:**
   - `costs` is a list containing two elements: `n - k + 1` and `1`.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Understanding `costs`:**
   - The first element of `costs` is `n - k + 1`.
   - The second element of `costs` is `1`.

3. **Understanding `h`:**
   - `h` is the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
   - Since `costs` contains `n - k + 1` and `1`, `h` is calculated as:
     \[
     h = n // (n - k + 1) + n // 1
     \]
   - `n // 1` is simply `n` because dividing any number by 1 results in the number itself.
   - Therefore, `h` simplifies to:
     \[
     h = n // (n - k + 1) + n
     \]

4. **Print Statement Execution:**
   - The print statement `print(*costs)` will unpack the list `costs` and print its elements separated by spaces.
   - The elements of `costs` are `n - k + 1` and `1`.

5. **Final Output:**
   - The output will be the elements of the list `costs` printed as `n - k + 1 1`.

Output: **n - k + 1 1**
