Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of coins `n` is less than the number of jewels `k`. According to the problem description, if `n < k`, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation always prints "YES" and "2" when `n < k`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:

```
1
5 6
```

The program will output:

```
YES
2
5 1
```

This is incorrect because Alice does not have enough coins to buy 6 jewels, so the correct output should be "NO".

To fix this, you need to add a check at the beginning of the `func_1` function to handle the case where `n < k`:

```python
def func_1(n, k):
    if n < k:
        print('NO')
        return
    # Rest of the code...
```

After making this change, the program will correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement.
