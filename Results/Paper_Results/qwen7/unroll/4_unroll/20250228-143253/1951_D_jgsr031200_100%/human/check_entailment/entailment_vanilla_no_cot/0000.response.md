Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Test Cases**: The solution only handles the simplest cases where `n == k` and `n >= k`. It does not handle more complex scenarios where multiple stalls with different prices are needed to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

2. **Logic Flaw in `func_1`**: The function `func_1` tries to split the coins into two stalls with specific values, but it doesn't guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels across multiple stalls. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is close to `n`, the function might not distribute the coins correctly among the stalls.

3. **Missing General Solution**: The solution lacks a general approach to setting up multiple stalls with appropriate prices to ensure Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. The current implementation assumes only two stalls, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Determine the number of stalls required.
- Set the prices of the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.
- Ensure that the total number of stalls does not exceed 60.

Here is a more appropriate approach to solving the problem:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    # If n is less than k, it's impossible to buy k jewels
    if n < k:
        print("NO")
        continue
    
    # Calculate the number of stalls needed
    stalls = 0
    current_jewels = 0
    prices = []
    
    while current_jewels < k:
        price = min(n, 10**18)
        n -= price
        prices.append(price)
        current_jewels += 1
        stalls += 1
        
        # If we have already set up 60 stalls, break
        if stalls == 60:
            break
    
    # Check if we have exactly k jewels
    if current_jewels == k:
        print("YES")
        print(stalls)
        print(" ".join(map(str, prices)))
    else:
        print("NO")
```

This solution ensures that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels by setting up the minimum number of stalls necessary and distributing the prices appropriately.
