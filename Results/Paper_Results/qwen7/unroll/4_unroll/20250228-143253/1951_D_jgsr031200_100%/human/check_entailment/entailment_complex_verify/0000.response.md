### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Initial Assessment:
- **Correctness:** **False**
- **Explanation:** The program does not correctly handle the scenario where the number of coins `n` is less than the number of jewels `k`. According to the problem description, if `n < k`, the output should be "NO". However, the current implementation always prints "YES" and "2" when `n < k`, which is incorrect.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers.
   - It checks if `n == k`:
     - If true, it prints "YES", 1, and 1, and returns.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If `n >= k`, it initializes `costs` as `[n - k + 1, 1]` and calculates the sum of `n // i` for each `i` in `costs`.
   - It then checks if this sum is less than `k`:
     - If true, it prints "NO".
     - If false, it prints "YES", 2, and the elements of `costs`.

2. **Annotated Code**:
   - The annotated code matches the actual implementation closely.
   - The logic for handling `n < k` is indeed missing, leading to incorrect outputs.

3. **Example Input**:
   - Consider the input `1 5 6`:
     - `n = 5`, `k = 6`.
     - The function will print "NO" and return, which is correct.

4. **Fix**:
   - The original assessment suggested adding a check at the beginning of `func_1` to handle the case where `n < k`:
     ```python
     def func_1(n, k):
         if n < k:
             print('NO')
             return
         # Rest of the code...
     ```

#### Verification:
- After applying the suggested fix, the function correctly handles the case where `n < k`:
  - For `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the output should be "NO".
  - For `n = 10` and `k = 5`, the output should be "YES" followed by the appropriate prices.

Given that the original assessment correctly identified the issue and provided a fix, the program now meets the requirements of the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is now correct after applying the suggested fix.
