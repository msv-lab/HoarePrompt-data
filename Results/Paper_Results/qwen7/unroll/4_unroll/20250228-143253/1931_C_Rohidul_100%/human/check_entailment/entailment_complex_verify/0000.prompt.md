You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the array a is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i. After executing the loop, ans is an integer representing the result of the computation based on the conditions given in the loop body, and it is printed for each test case. The sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a list of n positive integers a. It then calculates and prints an integer ans based on specific conditions involving the elements of the list a. The value of ans is determined by comparing segments of the list a and adjusting based on certain criteria.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not handle the scenario where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation involves selecting a subarray that includes the boundaries of different segments of these values.

For example, consider the following input:

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the result as `5` (the length of the array), but the correct answer should be `4`. This is because we can set the entire array to the value `1` using two operations: setting the first three elements to `1` and then setting the last two elements to `1`. The total cost would be `(3-1+1) + (5-3+1) = 4`.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks the start and end of the array for equality and does not properly account for the minimum cost to make all elements equal. It fails to consider the optimal subarray that minimizes the cost for arrays with more than two distinct values.
