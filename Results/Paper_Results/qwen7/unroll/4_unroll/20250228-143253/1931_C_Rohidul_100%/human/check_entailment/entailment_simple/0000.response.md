Reasoning:
Let's analyze the logic of the provided code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Parsing**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself. This part is correct and matches the problem statement.

2. **Initialization**: The variables `l` and `r` are initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively. These pointers help in finding the boundaries where the array elements differ. The variables `st` and `end` are used to count the length of the prefix and suffix where the array elements are the same.

3. **Finding Prefix and Suffix Lengths**:
   - The while loop starting at `l` checks for consecutive elements that are the same and increments `l` and `st`. This correctly counts the length of the prefix where the elements are the same.
   - The while loop starting at `r` does the same but in reverse, counting the length of the suffix where the elements are the same and increments `end`.

4. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The variable `ans` is calculated as `le - max(st, end)`. This is intended to find the minimum cost to make all elements equal by considering the cost of changing the entire prefix or suffix. However, there is a flaw here: the cost should consider the minimum between changing the prefix or the suffix, but the current logic only considers one of them.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same (`a[0] == a[-1]`), the code adjusts `ans` to account for both the prefix and suffix. This adjustment is necessary because changing the entire prefix or suffix might not be optimal if the middle part of the array has different values.

5. **Output**: The final value of `ans` is printed, which represents the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal.

Given the above analysis, the code does not correctly compute the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal. Specifically, the calculation of `ans` does not fully account for the optimal way to change the array to have all elements the same. The correct approach would involve considering the minimum cost of changing any subarray to a single value, which is not implemented in the current code.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
