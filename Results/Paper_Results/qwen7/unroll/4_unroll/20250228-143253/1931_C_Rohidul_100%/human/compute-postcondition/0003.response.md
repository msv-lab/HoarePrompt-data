Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of n positive integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n for all i). The function returns a result based on the given test cases.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list of `n` positive integers. The function processes these inputs and returns a result without taking any parameters directly within its definition.
