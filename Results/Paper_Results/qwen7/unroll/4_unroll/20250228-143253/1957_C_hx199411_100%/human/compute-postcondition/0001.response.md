State right before the while loop: `t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `t`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `t` must be non-zero (i.e., `t != 0`).

Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and \(10^4\), it is already guaranteed to be a non-zero positive integer. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to ensure the loop can execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 10^4**
