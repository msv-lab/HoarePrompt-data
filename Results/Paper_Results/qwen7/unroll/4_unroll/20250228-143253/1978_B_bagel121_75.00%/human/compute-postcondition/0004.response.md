Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each set of `n`, `a`, and `b`, it does not return anything explicitly but processes them according to some unspecified logic.**

Note: The specific processing logic for `n`, `a`, and `b` is not detailed in the given information, so the functionality description focuses on the acceptance and processing of these parameters across multiple test cases.
