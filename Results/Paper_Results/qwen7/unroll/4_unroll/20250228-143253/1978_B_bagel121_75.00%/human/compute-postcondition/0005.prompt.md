You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, where each line corresponds to the output of one test case. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` based on the given formulae, where `k` is the minimum of `b - a + 1` and `n`, `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic series, and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for `n - k` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes `t` test cases, where for each test case, it accepts three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9. For each set of `n`, `a`, and `b`, it does not return anything explicitly but processes them according to some unspecified logic.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
