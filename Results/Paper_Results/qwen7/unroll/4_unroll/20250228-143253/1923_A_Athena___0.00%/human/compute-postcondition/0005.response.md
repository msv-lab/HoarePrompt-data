Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer t (number of test cases), an integer n (length of the list), and a list of n integers a (indicating free cells with 0 and cells with chips with 1). For each test case, it removes all leading and trailing zeros from the list a, counts the remaining zeros, and prints the modified list followed by the count of zeros. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
