Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. Specifically, the program does not account for moving chips to the leftmost possible position, which is necessary to minimize the number of operations.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
0 1 0 1
```

The expected output is `1`, because we can move the rightmost chip to the leftmost free cell, resulting in `1 1 0 0`.

However, the current implementation does not perform this optimal move. Instead, it simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which does not guarantee the minimum number of operations.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that all chips are moved to the leftmost possible positions. This can be achieved by repeatedly moving each chip to the left until it cannot move further, ensuring that all chips are as close to the left as possible.
