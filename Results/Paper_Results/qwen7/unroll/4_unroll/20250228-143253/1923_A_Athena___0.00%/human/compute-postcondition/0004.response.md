Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list of n integers a (each either 0 or 1). It returns the index of the first cell containing a chip (indicated by 1) for each test case. If no cell contains a chip, it returns an appropriate message.**
