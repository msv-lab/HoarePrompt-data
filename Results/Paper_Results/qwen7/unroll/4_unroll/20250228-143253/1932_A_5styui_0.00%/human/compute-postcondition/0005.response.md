Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data for t test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n and a string representing a row of cells (where '.' is an empty cell, '@' is a cell with a coin, and '*' is a cell with thorns). The function returns a result for each test case indicating whether a path exists from the first cell to any cell containing a coin without stepping on thorns.**
