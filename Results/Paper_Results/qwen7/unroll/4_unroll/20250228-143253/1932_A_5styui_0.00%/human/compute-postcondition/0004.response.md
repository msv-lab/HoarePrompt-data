Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `s` is 0.

Explanation: The loop processes `a` inputs from the user, each followed by a string input. For each string, it counts the number of '@' characters and then prints the count. After printing, it resets `s` to 0. Since `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration, the final value of `s` will always be 0 regardless of the inputs provided. Therefore, the value of `s` remains unchanged at 0 after all iterations of the loop.
