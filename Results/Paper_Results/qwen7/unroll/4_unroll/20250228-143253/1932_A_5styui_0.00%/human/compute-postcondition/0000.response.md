Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, a is an input integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `a`. Since the input for `a` is specified to be a positive integer between 1 and 50, `a` will be an integer within this range. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
