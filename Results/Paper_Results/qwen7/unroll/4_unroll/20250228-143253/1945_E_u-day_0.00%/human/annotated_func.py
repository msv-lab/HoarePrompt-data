#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. Each test case consists of two integers n and x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a permutation p of length n consisting of distinct integers from 1 to n.
def func_1():
    return map(int, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object containing two integers, which are the values of n and x separated by a space, converted to integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into two integers `n` and `x`, converts them to integer type, and returns a map object containing these two integers.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4, each test case consists of n and x where 1 ≤ x ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and p is a list of integers representing a permutation of length n.
def func_2():
    return list(func_1())
    #The program returns a list generated by the function func_1(), which is not defined in the given information.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters and returns a list generated by calling another undefined function `func_1()`. The returned list is the final state of the program after the function concludes.
