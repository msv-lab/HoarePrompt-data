Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the permutation, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n, and `arr` is the return value of `func_2()`**.

Explanation: The code assigns the return value of `func_2()` to the variable `arr`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are the return values of `func_1()`. Therefore, `n` and `k` retain their initial conditions. The new variable `arr` is initialized with the return value of `func_2()`.
