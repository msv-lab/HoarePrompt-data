### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and First Query:**
   - The program initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it calls `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`. This means it compares `(p_0 | p_0)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. Since both sides are the same, the result will always be `=`. However, this step seems unnecessary and could be optimized away.

2. **Finding Maximum OR Value:**
   - The program then finds the index `i` that maximizes `(p_i | p_i)`. This is done by iterating from 1 to `n-1` and comparing `(p_mx | p_mx)` with `(p_i | p_i)`. If `(p_i | p_i) > (p_mx | p_mx)`, it updates `mx` to `i`.

3. **Finding Indices with Maximum XOR:**
   - After finding `mx`, the program initializes `v` with `[0]` and iterates from 1 to `n-1`. For each index `i`, it calls `func_1(mx, ans1, i, ans1)`. If the result is `<`, it resets `v` and sets `mx` to `i`. If the result is `=`, it appends `i` to `v`.
   - Then, it selects the first element of `v` as `mx` and iterates through the rest of `v` to find the index that maximizes `(p_ans | p_v[i])`.

4. **Outputting the Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` which are supposed to maximize the XOR value.

### Issues:
1. **Redundant First Query:**
   - The first loop where `func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)` is called is redundant since the result will always be `=`. It doesn't contribute to finding the optimal indices.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum XOR:**
   - The logic for finding the indices that maximize the XOR value is flawed. The program only considers comparisons involving `ans1` and `mx`, but it should consider all possible pairs to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

3. **Potential Missing Comparisons:**
   - The program might miss some pairs that could potentially give a higher XOR value if it only considers comparisons involving `ans1` and `mx`.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices that maximize the XOR value. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.

### Correctness:
**False**
