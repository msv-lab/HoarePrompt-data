### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
- We can ask up to 3n queries of the form \(? a b c d\) to compare \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
- After making at most 3n queries, we need to output the indices \(i\) and \(j\) that maximize \(p_i \oplus p_j\).

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function `func_1` compares \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\) and returns a string indicating the result of the comparison.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Initialization and Input Reading**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum OR Value with `ans1`**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_ans1 \mid p_i)\) with \((p_ans1 \mid p_ans1)\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates `ans1` to `i`.
   - This step is aimed at finding the index `i` such that \((p_ans1 \mid p_i)\) is minimized, which is not directly relevant to finding the maximum XOR value.

3. **Finding the Maximum OR Value with Updated `ans1`**
   - Initializes `mx` to 0 and `v` to `[0]`.
   - Iterates from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_mx \mid p_i)\) with \((p_ans1 \mid p_i)\).
   - If the result is `<`, it resets `v` to an empty list and updates `mx` to `i`, adding `i` to `v`.
   - If the result is `=`, it adds `i` to `v`.
   - This step is also aimed at finding the index `i` such that \((p_mx \mid p_i)\) is minimized, which again is not directly relevant to finding the maximum XOR value.

4. **Selecting the Best Candidate**
   - Sets `mx` to the first element of `v` and `ans` to the same element.
   - Iterates through the rest of the elements in `v` and uses `func_1` to compare \((p_ans \mid p_ans)\) with \((p_v[i] \mid p_v[i])\).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates `ans` to `v[i]`.
   - This step is still not directly related to finding the maximum XOR value.

5. **Outputting the Result**
   - Prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the result.
   - However, the logic to find the maximum XOR value is flawed, and the program makes more than 3n queries, violating the problem constraints.

#### Correct Approach
A correct approach would involve:
- Using the properties of XOR and OR operations to strategically choose indices to maximize the XOR value.
- Ensuring the number of queries does not exceed 3n.

#### Conclusion
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum XOR value and makes more than 3n queries, violating the problem constraints.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
