Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `p <= num`.

2. **Determine the current state of the variables involved in the loop condition**:
   - `p` is currently 2.
   - `num` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Check if the loop can execute the first time**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, `p` must be less than or equal to `num`.
   - Given that `p` is 2, `num` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute the first time.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - The only variables involved in the loop condition are `p` and `num`.
   - Since `p` is already 2, we need to ensure that `num` is at least 2.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `num` is at least 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`p` is 2, `num` must be at least 2**
