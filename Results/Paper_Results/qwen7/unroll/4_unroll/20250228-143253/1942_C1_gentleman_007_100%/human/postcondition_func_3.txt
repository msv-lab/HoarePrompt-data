The function accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of sides of a polygon), `m` (the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers representing the vertices). It returns a nested list where each of the `n` rows contains `m` elements, each of which is a reference to one of the integers in the list `v`.
