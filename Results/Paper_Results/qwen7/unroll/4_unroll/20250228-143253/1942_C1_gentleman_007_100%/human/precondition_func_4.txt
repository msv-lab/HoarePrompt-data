n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the function `func_1()` returns a pair of integers (x, y) where x and y are distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive. Additionally, y = 0 and 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5).
