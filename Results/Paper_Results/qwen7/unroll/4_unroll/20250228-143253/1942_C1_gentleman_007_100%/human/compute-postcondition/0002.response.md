Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where every element is initially set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where every element is 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where every element is 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `Lowest_Prime` as a list of length `num + 1` where every element is set to 0. This does not affect the values of `num`, `prime`, or `Highest_Prime`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
