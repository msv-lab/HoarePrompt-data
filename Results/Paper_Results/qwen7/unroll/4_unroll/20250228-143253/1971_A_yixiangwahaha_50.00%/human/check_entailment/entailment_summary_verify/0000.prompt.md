You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

- Program:
def func():
    t = input()
    x = []
    y = []
    for i in range(10):
        xylist = input().split(' ')
        x.append(int(xylist[0]))
        y.append(int(xylist[1]))
    for i in range(10):
        if x[i] < y[i]:
            print(x[i], ' ', y[i])
        else:
            print(y[i], ' ', x[i])



- Function Summary: 
The function reads an integer `t` and two lists of integers `x` and `y` from the input. It then compares the corresponding elements of `x` and `y` and prints 10 lines, each containing two integers. If the element in `x` is less than the corresponding element in `y`, it prints the element from `x` followed by the element from `y`. Otherwise, it prints the element from `y` followed by the element from `x`. The function does not return any value.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. According to the problem description, the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, and each subsequent line contains two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program assumes that there will always be exactly 10 test cases and reads 10 pairs of integers directly from the input, regardless of the actual value of `t`.

This means that if the input does not contain exactly 10 test cases, the program will either read extra data or stop prematurely, leading to incorrect results. For example, if the input is:

```
5
1 9
8 4
```

The program will process the first two test cases correctly but will then attempt to process two more test cases that do not exist, leading to undefined behavior.

To fix this, the program should read the number of test cases `t` first and then process exactly `t` pairs of integers.
