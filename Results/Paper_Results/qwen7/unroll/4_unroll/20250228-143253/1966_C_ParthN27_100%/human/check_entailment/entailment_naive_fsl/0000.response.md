Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the Nim game strategy to determine the winner. The logic in the program does not accurately reflect the XOR-based solution for determining the winner in the Nim game. Specifically, the program attempts to group the stones into unique values and then checks the differences between these values, which does not correctly apply the XOR strategy needed for this problem.

The correct approach involves using the XOR operation on the sizes of the piles. If the XOR of all pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) has a winning strategy; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        xor_sum = 0
        for pile in arr:
            xor_sum ^= pile
        if xor_sum != 0:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')
```

This corrected version correctly implements the XOR strategy to determine the winner based on the initial configuration of the piles.
