Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) (number of test cases), an integer \( n \) (number of piles), and a list of \( n \) integers representing the number of stones in each pile. For each test case, it determines whether Alice or Bob wins a game based on the sorted unique list of stone piles. If there exists at least one pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list (with an added 0 at the beginning) such that their difference is greater than 1, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins. The function prints 'Alice' or 'Bob' for each test case based on this condition.**
