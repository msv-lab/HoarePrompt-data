Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic implemented in the `func_1` function meets the requirements specified in the problem statement.

1. **Problem Requirements**: The goal is to divide the numbers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.

2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses the expression `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to modify each number.
   - This expression flips all the bits of the number, effectively making it unique in terms of the 31 least significant bits.
   - The function then counts the number of unique elements after applying this transformation.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The expression `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` flips all bits of `num`. For example, if `num = 43` (binary `101011`), then `43 ^ (1 << 31) - 1` results in `2147483642` (binary `1111111111111111111111111010110`).
   - Flipping all bits ensures that no two numbers will have the same bit value in the 31 least significant bits if they were originally different.
   - Counting the number of unique elements after this transformation gives us the minimum number of groups needed because each unique transformed number represents a distinct group.

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of groups required.

Correctness: **True**
