#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of integers, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that each integer in the list is less than \(2^{31}\).
def func_1(n, a):
    res = 0
    count = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in count:
            count[num ^ (1 << 31) - 1] = count.get(num ^ (1 << 31) - 1, 0) + 1
            res += 1
        else:
            count[num] -= 1
        
    #State: Output State: `res` is the number of unique elements in `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, `n` is the original length of `a`, `a` is the original list of `n` non-negative integers, and `count` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `a` after the bitwise operation, and its value is the difference between the number of times it appears in `a` and the number of times its counterpart (after the bitwise operation) appears. If a key does not appear in `count`, it means its counterpart appeared more times, and its value will be negative. If a key appears in `count`, it means it appeared more times than its counterpart, and its value will be positive or zero.
    return res
    #The program returns the number of unique elements in list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). It applies the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to each element in the list `a`, counts the number of unique elements in the modified list, and returns this count.
