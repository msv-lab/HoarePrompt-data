Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies processing multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^5), and a list of n integers a (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The array a is considered beautiful. Based on these inputs, the function returns whether each array a is beautiful according to some criteria.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It then checks if the array a meets the criteria to be considered "beautiful" and returns a result for each test case indicating whether the array is beautiful or not.
