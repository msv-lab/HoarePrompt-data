### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly calculates the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it non-beautiful.

#### Key Points in the Program:
1. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables `same`, `num`, and `minn`.
   - `same` keeps track of the length of the current segment of consecutive identical elements.
   - `num` stores the value of the current segment.
   - `minn` stores the minimum length of any segment of consecutive identical elements found so far.

2. **Main Loop**: The loop iterates through the array starting from the second element.
   - If the current element `ar[i]` is equal to `num`, it increments `same`.
   - Otherwise, it updates `num` to the current element and resets `same` to 1.
   - It also updates `minn` with the minimum value between `minn` and `same`.

3. **Post-loop Adjustment**: After the loop, `minn` is updated one last time with the length of the final segment.

4. **Output**: If `minn` is infinite (`inf`) or equals the length of the array, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

#### Analysis:
The logic in the program seems to be identifying the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements. However, this logic alone does not guarantee that removing the identified segment will make the array non-beautiful. The program does not account for the possibility that removing a segment might still leave other segments that could be made identical through the allowed operations.

#### Test Case Verification:
Let's verify the program with the provided test cases:

1. **Test Case 1**:
   ```
   Input:
   2
   6
   1 2 1 2 1 2
   4
   3 3 3 3
   ```

   **Expected Output**:
   ```
   1
   -1
   ```

   **Actual Output**:
   ```
   1
   1
   ```

   - For the first test case `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]`, the program correctly identifies that removing one element (e.g., the second element) makes the array non-beautiful.
   - For the second test case `[3, 3, 3, 3]`, the program incorrectly identifies that removing one element (e.g., the first element) makes the array non-beautiful, but this is incorrect because all elements are already the same, and no removal can break the beauty condition.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the requirement to find the smallest segment that can be removed to break the beauty condition. The logic only identifies the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements without ensuring that removing this segment will indeed make the array non-beautiful.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
