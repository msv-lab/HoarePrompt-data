Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the given code does not accurately determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The code attempts to find the minimum length of consecutive segments where the elements are the same but does not account for the specific operation allowed to make the array non-beautiful. It simply finds the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and prints that as the answer, which is incorrect.

2. **Incorrect Operation Handling**: The problem requires finding the minimum number of removals needed to break the condition of the array being beautiful. The current implementation does not handle this correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to identify the longest sequence of elements that can be made identical by the given operation and then calculate the minimum number of removals required to break this sequence.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Find the longest segment of consecutive identical elements
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            if ar[i] == ar[i-1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # If the entire array is identical, it cannot be made non-beautiful
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            # The minimum number of removals is the length of the longest segment minus one
            print(max_length - 1)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. It iterates through the array to find the longest segment of consecutive identical elements.
2. If the entire array is identical, it outputs `-1` because no removals can make it non-beautiful.
3. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the longest segment, which is `max_length - 1`.

This approach ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
