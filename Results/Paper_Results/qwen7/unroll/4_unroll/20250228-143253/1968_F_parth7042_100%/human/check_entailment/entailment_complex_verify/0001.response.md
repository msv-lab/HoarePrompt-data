### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program correctly reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through each test case, extracting `n`, `q`, and the array `a`.

2. **Prefix XOR Array Construction:**
   - The prefix XOR array `pf` is constructed correctly, where `pf[i]` is the XOR of the first `i` elements of `a`.
   - This is done efficiently with a loop that updates `pf[i]` as `pf[i-1] ^ a[i]`.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values:**
   - The program uses a `defaultdict` to map each prefix XOR value to its indices in the array.
   - This allows quick lookups of positions where a particular prefix XOR value occurs.

4. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values: `x = pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - If `x` is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting because the XOR of the entire subarray is zero.
   - Otherwise, the program checks if there exists a valid split by using binary search (`bisect_left`) on the mapped indices.

5. **Split Validity Check:**
   - The check ensures that the split is valid by verifying the positions of the split points within the subarray bounds.
   - Specifically, it checks if there exists an index `i` between `l` and `r` such that `pf[i] == pf[r] ^ pf[l-1]`.
   - The condition `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensures that the split point is within the valid range and that the split is possible.

6. **Output Generation:**
   - The results are collected and printed at the end.

### Analysis of the Annotated Code:

- **Initialization and Input Reading:**
  - The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input.
  - The `index` variable keeps track of the current position in the `data` list, which is used to extract the required values for each test case.

- **Prefix XOR Array Calculation:**
  - The prefix XOR array `pf` is correctly computed, and the `mp` dictionary maps each prefix XOR value to its indices.

- **Query Handling:**
  - For each query, the program calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
  - The binary search (`bisect_left`) is used to find the appropriate split points.
  - The conditions `it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]` ensure that the split is valid.
