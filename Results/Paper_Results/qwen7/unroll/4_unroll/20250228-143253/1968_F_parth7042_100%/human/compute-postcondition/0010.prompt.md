You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, each test case consists of n and q where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 1 ≤ q ≤ 2·10^5, a is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i < 2^30, and each query is a pair of integers l and r where 1 ≤ l < r ≤ n.
def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        
        index += 2
        
        a = [0] * (n + 1)

            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and v1[it1] < v2[it2]:
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: `index` is 6, `t` is an integer obtained from `int(data[0])`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `results` is a list containing 'YES' or 'NO' based on the queries processed, `n` and `q` are integers obtained from `int(data[index-2])` and `int(data[index-1])` respectively, `a` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to 0, `pf` is a list of `n+1` integers initialized to 0, `mp` is a dictionary with keys as integers and values as lists of indices, and `results` contains the answers to the queries.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: YES\nNO\nYES\n... (where each line represents a result from the queries processed)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a predefined set of inputs consisting of a positive integer `t`, a list `a` of `n` integers, and `q` queries. Each query is a pair of integers `l` and `r`. The function returns results based on the specified conditions for each query.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
