Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the input and processes each test case.
2. It initializes necessary variables and structures like prefix XOR (`pf`), a dictionary to store indices of prefix XOR values (`mp`), and a list to store the results of queries (`results`).
3. For each query, it calculates the required prefix XOR value and checks if there exists a valid split that satisfies the condition.
4. The logic for checking the existence of a valid split is sound and correctly uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices.
5. The program handles all constraints and examples provided in the problem statement accurately.

Given the above analysis, the annotated program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
