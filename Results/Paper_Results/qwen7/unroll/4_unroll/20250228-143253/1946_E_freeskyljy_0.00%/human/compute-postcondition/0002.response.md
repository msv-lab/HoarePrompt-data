Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, R is a list containing the first three integers from input converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code `R = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `R`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and is still a positive integer within the range of 1 to 10^4. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are replaced by the first three integers from the input, which are now stored in the list `R`.
