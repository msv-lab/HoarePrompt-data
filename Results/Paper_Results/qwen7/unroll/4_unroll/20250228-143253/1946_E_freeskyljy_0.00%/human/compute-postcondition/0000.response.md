Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, N, M1, M2 are assigned the values of the first three integers from input, separated by spaces.**

Explanation: The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to variables `N`, `M1`, and `M2`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged. The values of `N`, `M1`, and `M2` are now specific integers derived from the input, but their exact values depend on the user's input. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 still holds.
