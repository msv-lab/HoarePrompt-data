Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `R` is a list containing the first three integers from input converted to integers, and the last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`, and either `L[0]` is equal to 1 or `R[0]` is to `N`, and either `M1` is not greater than 1 or `M2` is not greater than 1 or `L[-2]` is not equal to `R[1]`, `ans` is calculated as `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`**.

This means that the value of `ans` is the result of the combination function `math.comb(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)`. The other variables retain their initial conditions.
