Output State: **The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input pair (n, k), the code calculates and prints a specific value based on the described logic. The final output state will be a series of printed values, one for each input pair.**

To provide a more concrete example, let's assume we have two input pairs: (3, 2) and (4, 3).

For the first input pair (3, 2):
- The value of `m` starts as 2, and `n` becomes 1.
- The loop continues with `n` becoming 0.
- Then, `L` is empty, so `tot` remains 0.
- The value of `k` is 2, and since `tot` (which is 0) is less than 2 but `tot + a` (where `a` is the only element in `L`, which is 1) is greater than or equal to 2, it prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)`, which is `1 * (2 * 2 - 1) = 3`.

For the second input pair (4, 3):
- The value of `m` starts as 2, and `n` becomes 2.
- The loop continues with `m` being 1, and `n` becomes 1.
- The loop continues with `m` being 1 again, and `n` becomes 0.
- Then, `L` is empty, so `tot` remains 0.
- The value of `k` is 3, and since `tot` (which is 0) is less than 3 but `tot + a` (where `a` is the only element in `L`, which is 1) is greater than or equal to 3, it prints `pow * (2 * k - 1)`, which is `2 * (2 * 3 - 1) = 10`.

So, the output state would be: **3 10**.
