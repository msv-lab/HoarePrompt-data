State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, _ is now 1** 

Explanation:
- The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python for loop indices when you don't need to use the index value inside the loop. It is not a state that can be adjusted.
- The variable `t` is the only variable mentioned in the loop head that affects whether the loop can execute. The loop will run `t` times, so `t` must be an integer within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and the loop counter `_` is now 1 (though the value of `_` itself cannot be adjusted).
