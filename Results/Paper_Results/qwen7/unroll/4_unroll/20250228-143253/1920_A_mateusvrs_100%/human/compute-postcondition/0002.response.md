Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable involved here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1. If `t` is 0, the loop will not execute.

3. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the initial state given is that `t` is the integer input value and `r` is an empty list, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

4. **Consider the loop body**: Although the loop body is omitted, the loop will still need to check the condition `t > 0` to determine if it should continue executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `r` is an empty list**
