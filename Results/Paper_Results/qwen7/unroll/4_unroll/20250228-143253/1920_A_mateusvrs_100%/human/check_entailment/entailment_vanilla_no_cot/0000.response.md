Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Processing Constraints**: For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n` and then processes each constraint:
   - If the constraint is of type 1 (`a == 1`), it updates `bx` to be the maximum value between `x` and the current `bx`.
   - If the constraint is of type 2 (`a == 2`), it updates `ax` to be the minimum value between `x` and the current `ax`.
   - If the constraint is of type 3 (`a == 3`), it adds `x` to a set `cx` to keep track of values that `k` cannot be.
3. **Checking Feasibility**: After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it means there is no feasible value for `k`, and it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
4. **Counting Valid Values**: If `bx` is not greater than `ax`, it calculates the number of valid values for `k` by subtracting the count of invalid values (stored in `tmp`) from the total range (`ax - bx + 1`).
5. **Outputting Results**: Finally, it prints the results for all test cases.

The logic handles all constraints and ensures that the solution is correct according to the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.
