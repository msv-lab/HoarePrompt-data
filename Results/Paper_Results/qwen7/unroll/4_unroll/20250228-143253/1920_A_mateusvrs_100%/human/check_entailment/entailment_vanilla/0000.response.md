Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of constraints `n`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A set `cx` is used to store values that `k` should not be equal to.
   - Variables `ax` and `bx` are initialized to handle the range of valid `k` values:
     - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007).
     - `bx` is initialized to -1.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint, the program updates `ax` and `bx` based on the type of constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, `bx` is updated to the maximum of `x` and `bx`.
     - If `a == 2`, `ax` is updated to the minimum of `x` and `ax`.
     - If `a == 3`, `x` is added to the set `cx`.

4. **Checking Valid Range:**
   - After processing all constraints, the program checks if `bx` is greater than `ax`. If so, it appends `0` to the result list `r` because no valid `k` exists.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values:
     - It iterates through the set `cx` and counts how many elements fall within the range `[bx, ax]`.
     - The number of valid `k` values is calculated as `ax - bx + 1 - tmp`, where `tmp` is the count of invalid `k` values.

5. **Output:**
   - The results are printed.

### Correctness Check

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, let's verify if the program correctly handles all scenarios:

1. **Range Constraints:**
   - The program correctly updates `ax` and `bx` to define the valid range for `k`.
   
2. **Exclusion Constraints:**
   - The program correctly identifies and excludes values in `cx` from the valid range.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where `bx > ax` by returning `0`.
   - The program correctly handles overlapping constraints and ensures that the range `[bx, ax]` is properly adjusted.

4. **Guarantees:**
   - The problem guarantees that there is at least one constraint of type 1 and one of type 2, ensuring that `ax` and `bx` will always have a defined range.
   - The program also ensures that no two constraints are the same, preventing any ambiguity.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers `k` that satisfy all constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
