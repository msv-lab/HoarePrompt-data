Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. Specifically, the program checks only the first row and the last row for uniformity and compares them, which is insufficient to determine the possibility of making the entire grid uniform.

Consider the following test case:
```
3 3
BBB
BBB
BBB
```

In this case, all squares are already the same color (black), so the correct output should be "YES". However, the program will not detect this scenario because it does not check the entire grid for uniformity but only the first and last rows.

Additionally, consider another test case:
```
3 3
BBB
BBW
BBB
```

Here, the first and last rows are uniform, but the middle row disrupts the uniformity. The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the first and last rows.

Therefore, the program fails to handle cases where the grid is uniform but the first and last rows are not checked properly, leading to incorrect results.
