Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n × m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid contains cells with either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, t (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function evaluates the grid and returns a result based on specific criteria.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a grid of specified dimensions filled with 'W' and 'B'. The function processes these grids according to certain rules but does not explicitly take any parameters other than the grid itself, which is implied through the input values of n, m, and t.
