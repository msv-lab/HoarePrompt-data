### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the problem description step-by-step.

#### Problem Description:
- We need to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the given operations.
- The operations allow selecting any two squares of the same color and coloring all squares within the subrectangle defined by those two squares to the same color.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = []
        first_row = ''
        last_row = ''
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(input())
            first_row += a[-1][0]
            last_row += a[-1][-1]
        if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:
            print('NO')
        elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:
            print('NO')
        else:
            print('YES')
```

#### Function Summary:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's start and end characters.
- If either condition is met, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

#### Analysis:
1. **Checking Uniformity of Rows and Columns:**
   - The program checks if the first row (`a[0]`) is uniform and different from the last row (`a[-1]`).
   - It also checks if the first character of each row (`first_row`) is uniform and different from the last character of each row (`last_row`).

2. **Insufficient Checks:**
   - The program only checks the first and last rows for uniformity and does not check the entire grid for uniformity.
   - This approach is insufficient because:
     - A grid can be uniform even if the first and last rows are not uniform.
     - The program fails to handle cases where the grid is uniform but the first and last rows are not checked properly.

3. **Examples:**
   - **Example 1:** `3 3`
     ```
     BBB
     BBB
     BBB
     ```
     - All squares are already the same color (black), so the correct output should be "YES".
     - The program outputs "NO" because it only checks the first and last rows.

   - **Example 2:** `3 3`
     ```
     BBB
     BBW
     BBB
     ```
     - The first and last rows are uniform, but the middle row disrupts the uniformity.
     - The program incorrectly outputs "YES" because it only checks the first and last rows.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To correctly determine if it's possible to make all squares the same color, the program should check if the entire grid is uniform.
   - It should iterate through each row and ensure that all characters in the row are the same.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if it's possible to make all squares in the grid the same color. It only checks the first and last rows, which is insufficient.

**Final: False**
