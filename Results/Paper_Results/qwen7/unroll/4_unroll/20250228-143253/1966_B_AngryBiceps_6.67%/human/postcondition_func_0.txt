The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a grid of size n Ã— m where n and m are positive integers up to 500. Each cell in the grid contains either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, the function checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's start and end characters. If either condition is met, the function prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return any value but outputs a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the evaluation of each test case.
