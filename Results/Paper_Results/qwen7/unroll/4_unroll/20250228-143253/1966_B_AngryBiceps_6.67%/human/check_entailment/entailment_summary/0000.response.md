Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The program checks for two specific conditions that do not cover all scenarios where it is possible to make all squares the same color. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Condition 1**: `if len(set(a[0])) == 1 and a[0] != a[-1]:`
   - This condition checks if the first row is uniform and different from the last row.
   - However, this condition alone is insufficient because there could be other configurations where the entire grid can be made uniform without the first and last rows being different.

2. **Condition 2**: `elif len(set(first_row)) == 1 and first_row != last_row:`
   - This condition checks if any row (specifically the first row) is uniform and different from the last row.
   - Similar to the first condition, this is also insufficient because it only considers the first row and does not account for other possible uniform configurations.

3. **Other Scenarios**:
   - The program fails to consider scenarios where the entire grid can be made uniform through a series of operations, even if no single row or column meets the specific conditions mentioned.
   - For example, a grid where all rows are identical except for one row that is different from the others can still be made uniform.

Given these points, the program does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares the same color for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
