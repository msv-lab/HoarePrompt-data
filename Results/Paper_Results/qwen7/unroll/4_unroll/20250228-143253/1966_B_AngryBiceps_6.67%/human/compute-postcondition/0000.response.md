Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the one used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will iterate based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid for the loop to execute.
   - The input value should be a positive integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

3. **Consider the Given State:**
   - The given state is that `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.

4. **Formulate the Required State:**
   - For the loop to execute, the input value must be a positive integer within the range 1 to 10^4. This means the input value must be exactly `t`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input value itself, ensuring it matches the condition for the loop to execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
