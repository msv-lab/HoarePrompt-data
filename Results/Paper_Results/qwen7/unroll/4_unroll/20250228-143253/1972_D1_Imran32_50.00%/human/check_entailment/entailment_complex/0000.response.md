Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to solve the problem of counting the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions.
2. The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case separately.
3. For each test case, the program reads two integers \(n\) and \(m\).
4. However, the function `func_1()` in the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Specifically, it calculates \(ans\) using the formula \(n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{int}(\sqrt{n})+1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor\), which does not match the required condition \(a + b \text{ is a multiple of } b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Given the problem statement, the correct approach should involve checking the condition \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{b \cdot \gcd(a, b)}\) for each pair \((a, b)\) where \(1 \leq a \leq n\) and \(1 \leq b \leq m\). The provided code does not perform this check.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not implement the correct logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
