### Reasoning

The original assessment is accurate. Let's break down the issues in the given program and verify why it does not correctly solve the problem.

#### Issues with the Given Program

1. **Incorrect Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` is defined but does not take any parameters. This means it cannot access the values of `n` and `m` passed during the loop in the main program. The function should accept `n` and `m` as parameters.

2. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop in `func_1` iterates from 2 to \(\sqrt{n}\), which is irrelevant to the problem's constraints. The problem requires iterating over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\) and \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).

3. **Incorrect Condition Check**:
   - The program does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it performs some unrelated calculations involving the square root of \(n\).

4. **Incorrect Calculation**:
   - The variable `ans` is updated based on a calculation that does not reflect the required condition. The current implementation does not count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) at all.

#### Correct Approach

The correct approach involves iterating through all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checking if they satisfy the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Final Evaluation

Given the analysis above, the original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as intended. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**
