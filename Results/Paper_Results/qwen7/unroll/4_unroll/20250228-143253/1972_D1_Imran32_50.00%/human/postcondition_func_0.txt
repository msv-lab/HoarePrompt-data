The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each valid test case, it calculates the value of \( ans \) as \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\text{int}(\sqrt{n})+1} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \), where \( \left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \) denotes the floor function (rounding down to the nearest integer). After processing all test cases, it prints the final value of \( ans \) for the last test case. If any test case fails to meet the conditions (i.e., \( n \) and \( m \) are not within the specified range or their sums exceed the limit), the function still processes the valid part and prints the result accordingly.
