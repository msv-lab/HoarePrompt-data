Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and splits them based on spaces, converting them to integers and assigning them to `n` and `k` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation.
