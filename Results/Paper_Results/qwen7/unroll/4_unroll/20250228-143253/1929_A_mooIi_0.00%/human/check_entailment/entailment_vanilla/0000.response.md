### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. To achieve this, we should sort the array and then rearrange it such that the largest possible positive differences are achieved.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.
   - It then sorts the array and prints the sorted array as a string with space-separated values.
   
3. **Key Issues**:
   - The program does not calculate the beauty of the array as required. Instead, it simply sorts the array and prints it.
   - Sorting the array does not necessarily maximize the beauty. For example, consider the array `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`. Sorting it gives `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]`, but the beauty is `(54-43) + (80-54) + (90-80) + (100-90) = 11 + 26 + 10 + 10 = 57`.
   - The program should construct the array in a way that maximizes the beauty, which involves placing the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, followed by sorting the rest in ascending order.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - Sort the array.
   - Place the smallest element at the start and the largest at the end.
   - Arrange the remaining elements in ascending order in between.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

**Correctness: **False**
