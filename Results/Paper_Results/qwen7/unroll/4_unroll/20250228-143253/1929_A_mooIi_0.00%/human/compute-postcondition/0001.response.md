Output State: The output state will consist of multiple lines, each containing a sequence of space-separated integers. These integers will be the sorted versions of the input sequences provided for each test case, with each number converted to a string. The number of lines will be equal to the number of test cases, and each line will contain exactly `n` integers, where `n` is the value of the variable `n` for that particular test case. Each integer in these lines will be unique within its respective test case and will be in ascending order.
