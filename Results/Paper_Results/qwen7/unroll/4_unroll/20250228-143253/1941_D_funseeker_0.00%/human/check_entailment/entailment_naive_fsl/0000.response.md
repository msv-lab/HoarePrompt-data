Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads the input, processes the throws, and calculates the possible players who could have the ball after all the throws. The program uses sets to efficiently handle the possible positions of the ball and correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws using the '?' symbol. Additionally, it correctly adjusts for the case where the ball could be at position 0 by adding position n to the set. The program outputs the number of possible players and their indices in the required format. Given the thorough implementation and the handling of all specified cases, the program is correct.
