### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Returns an integer value which is the result of `func_1()`.
   - `func_3()`: Returns a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting to integers the output of `func_1()`.
   - `func_4()`: This function handles the main logic of the program. It reads the number of players (`n`), the number of throws (`m`), and the initial player (`x`). It then iterates through each throw, updating the possible positions of the ball based on the distance (`r`) and direction (`c`).

2. **Logic Analysis**:
   - The function `func_4()` correctly initializes the set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
   - For each throw, it updates the set `ans` to include the new possible positions based on whether the direction is clockwise (`'0'` or `'?'`), counterclockwise (`'1'` or `'?'`), or unknown (`'?'`).
   - After processing all throws, it checks if position `0` is in the set `ans`. If it is, it removes `0` and adds `n` to the set, effectively wrapping around the circle.
   - Finally, it prints the size of the set `ans` and the elements of the set in sorted order.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The logic correctly handles the circular nature of the game by using modulo arithmetic.
   - The handling of unknown directions (`'?'`) ensures that both possible directions are considered.
   - The final check for position `0` and its replacement with `n` is correctly implemented.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the problem statement, providing the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in sorted order.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described.
