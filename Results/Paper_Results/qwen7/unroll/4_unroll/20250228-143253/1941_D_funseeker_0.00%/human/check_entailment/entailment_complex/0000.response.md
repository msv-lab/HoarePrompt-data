### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definitions and Input Parsing:**
   - `func_1()` reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()` calls `func_1()` and returns an integer, which represents the number of test cases.
   - `func_3()` calls `func_1()` and returns a list of integers obtained by splitting and converting to integers the output of `func_1()`. This function is not used in the main logic but seems to be part of the overall structure.

2. **Main Function (`func_4()`):**
   - The function correctly initializes the starting player `x` and iterates through each of the `m` throws.
   - For each throw, it updates the possible positions of the ball based on the distance `r` and the direction `c` (or `?`).
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, it adds the clockwise position `(q + r) % n` to the set of possible positions.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, it adds the counterclockwise position `(q - r) % n` to the set of possible positions.
   - After processing all throws, it ensures that position `0` is replaced with `n` if it exists in the set.
   - Finally, it prints the number of unique possible positions and the list of those positions.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints:**
   - The code handles the modulo operation correctly to ensure positions wrap around the circle.
   - The use of sets ensures that all possible positions are unique.
   - The replacement of position `0` with `n` is handled correctly.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided implementation matches the problem description and constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness: **True**
