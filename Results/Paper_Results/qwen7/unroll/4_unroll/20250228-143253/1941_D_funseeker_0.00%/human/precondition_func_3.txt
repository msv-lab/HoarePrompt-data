n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and the function `func_1` returns a string containing the distance `r` and the direction `c` of each throw in the format "r c".
