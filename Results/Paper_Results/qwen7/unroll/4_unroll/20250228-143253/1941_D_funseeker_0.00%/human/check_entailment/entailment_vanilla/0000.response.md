### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `func_1` and `func_2` to parse integers.
   - It uses `func_3` to read multiple space-separated integers from the input.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The initial position of the ball (`x`) is stored in the `ans` set, which is initialized to `{x}`.

3. **Processing Each Throw**:
   - For each of the `m` throws, the program reads the distance `r` and the direction `c`.
   - If `c` is `'0'` or `'?'`, the ball can be thrown clockwise, so `(q + r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.
   - If `c` is `'1'` or `'?'`, the ball can be thrown counterclockwise, so `(q - r) % n` is added to the set `temp`.

4. **Updating the Set**:
   - The `ans` set is updated to `temp` after processing each throw.

5. **Handling Edge Case**:
   - If the final position is `0`, it is adjusted to `n` by removing `0` and adding `n` to the set.

6. **Output**:
   - The size of the `ans` set is printed, followed by the elements of the set in sorted order.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.

### Correctness:
**True**
