Postcondition: **`leaves` is a list containing all nodes from `tree` that have exactly one adjacent node, `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node and its value is a list of its adjacent nodes, the `n` variable remains an integer representing the number of nodes in the tree, the `start` variable retains its original integer value representing the starting node for the game, `dist1` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS, `dist2` is the shortest distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS, and either `dist1` or `dist2` is even.**
