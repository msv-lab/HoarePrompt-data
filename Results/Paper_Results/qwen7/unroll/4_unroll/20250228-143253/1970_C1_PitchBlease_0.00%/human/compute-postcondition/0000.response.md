Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `tree` is a dictionary where keys are node indices and values are lists of neighboring node indices.**

The code initializes a queue with a single tuple `(start, 0)`. The `start` node is added to the queue along with a distance of `0` from the start node. The `target` and `tree` variables remain unchanged.
