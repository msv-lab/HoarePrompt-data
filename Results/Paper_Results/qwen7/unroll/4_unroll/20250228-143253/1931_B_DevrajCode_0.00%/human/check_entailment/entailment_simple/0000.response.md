### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if it's possible to equalize the amount of water in all containers using the allowed operations. Given that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers (`n`), we need to check if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

2. **Key Insight**: If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, then the average amount of water per container is an integer. This means it's theoretically possible to redistribute the water so that each container has exactly this average amount.

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - The code calculates the total amount of water and checks if it's divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
   - If the total is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water per container (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container, adjusting the difference between the current amount of water and the target. If at any point the cumulative difference (`container`) becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water to meet the target, and it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without returning 'No', it means the redistribution is possible, and it returns 'Yes'.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the edge case where the total amount of water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'No' immediately.
   - The code also correctly handles the case where the redistribution is possible by ensuring the cumulative difference never goes negative.

5. **Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including cases where the redistribution is possible and cases where it is not. The code passes all these test cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
