Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `water`, which is an iterator over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `water`**: Since `water` is an iterator over the list `a`, at the start of the loop, `water` should be set to the first element of the list `a`.

3. **Determine the state of `a`**: The list `a` must contain `n` non-negative integers, and the sum of all elements in `a` must be divisible by `n`. This ensures that the division operation `total_water // n` is valid.

4. **Determine the state of `total_water`**: The value of `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and it is already correctly initialized based on the given information.

5. **Determine the state of `n`**: The variable `n` is a positive integer, and its value is already correctly initialized based on the given information.

6. **Determine the state of `target`**: The variable `target` is `total_water // n`, and it is already correctly initialized based on the given information.

7. **Determine the state of `container`**: The variable `container` is initially set to 0, and its value is already correctly initialized based on the given information.

Given these points, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the initial value of `water`, which should be set to the first element of the list `a`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is 0, `water` is the first element of the list `a`**
