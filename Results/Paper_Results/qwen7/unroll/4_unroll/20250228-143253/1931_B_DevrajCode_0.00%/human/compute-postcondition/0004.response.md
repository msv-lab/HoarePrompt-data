Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, and `target` is `total_water // n`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `total_water` divided by `n` (integer division) to the variable `target`. Since `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a` and is divisible by `n`, `target` will be an integer representing the average value of each element in `a`. All other conditions and values remain unchanged.
