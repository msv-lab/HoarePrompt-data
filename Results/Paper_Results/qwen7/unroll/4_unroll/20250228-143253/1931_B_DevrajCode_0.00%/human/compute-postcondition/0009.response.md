Output State: `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`, `target` is `total_water // n`, and `container` is 0 or a negative number if any `water - target` makes the `container` less than 0 during the loop execution. If at any point `container` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, `container` remains 0.
