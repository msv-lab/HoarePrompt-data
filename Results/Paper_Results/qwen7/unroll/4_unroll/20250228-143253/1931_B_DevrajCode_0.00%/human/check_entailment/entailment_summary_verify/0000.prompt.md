You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
a = list(map(int, data[1:]))
print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    total_water = sum(a)
    if total_water % n != 0:
        return 'No'
    target = total_water // n
    container = 0
    for water in a:
        container += water - target
        if container < 0:
            return 'No'
    return 'Yes'



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where the sum of all elements in `a` is divisible by `n`. It calculates the target amount of water each element should have (`total_water // n`). Then, it iterates through the list `a`, adjusting a cumulative difference (`container`) between the current element and the target. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. If the cumulative difference never goes negative, the function returns 'Yes'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Here’s a breakdown of why the program works for all potential cases:

1. **Initial Check**: The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because it’s impossible to distribute the water evenly if the total is not divisible by `n`.

2. **Target Calculation**: If the total amount of water is divisible by `n`, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`total_water // n`).

3. **Balance Check**: The program then iterates through each container and checks if the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount accumulates to zero. If at any point the accumulated difference becomes negative, it means it’s impossible to balance the water, and the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

This approach ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly. Since the sum of `a_i` is guaranteed to be divisible by `n`, the only way the program could fail is if the water cannot be evenly distributed, which is precisely what the program checks for. Therefore, the program is correct.
