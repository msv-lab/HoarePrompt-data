Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the specified operation. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into individual components, which is an efficient way to handle multiple test cases.
2. **Sum Calculation and Target Check**: It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by the number of containers (`n`). If not, it immediately returns 'No'.
3. **Container Balance Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts and keeps track of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount of water per container (`target`). If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the containers, and it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program correctly determines the possibility of balancing the containers for each test case.
