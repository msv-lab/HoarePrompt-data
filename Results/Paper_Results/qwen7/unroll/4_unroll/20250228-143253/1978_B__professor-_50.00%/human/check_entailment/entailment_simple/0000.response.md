Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks different conditions to determine the maximum profit:
   - If `b <= a`, it means there's no benefit from the promotion, so it sells all buns at the usual price `a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it means the promotion period is longer than the number of buns, so it sells the first `n` buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series for the first `k` buns and the usual price for the remaining buns.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the logic appears to be correct and matches the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
