Output State: **`totalOne` is equal to the length of `pre`, `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list of integers where each element is the index (i + 1) of every occurrence of '>' in `s1`, `preOne` is a list of accumulated sums starting from 0, `suffZero` is a list containing 0**.

Explanation: The code initializes `suffZero` as a list containing a single element, which is 0. This does not affect the values of `totalOne`, `s1`, `pre`, or `preOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states, and `suffZero` is updated to contain the value 0.
