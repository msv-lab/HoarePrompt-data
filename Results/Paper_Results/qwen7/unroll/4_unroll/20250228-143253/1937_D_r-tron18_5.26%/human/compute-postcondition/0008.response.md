Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `totalOne` is 0.
   - `s1` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '<' and '>'.
   - `pre` is an empty list.
   - `preOne` is an empty list.
   - `suffZero` is a list of length `n+1` where each element is the sum of all indices up to that point in `s1`.
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with each element calculated based on the conditions inside the loop.

2. **Code Snippet:**
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - `ans` is a list of length `n` with each element calculated based on the conditions inside the loop. Since no specific conditions or formulas are provided for how the elements of `ans` are calculated, we cannot determine the exact values of the elements in `ans`.
   - The `*` operator in the `print` function is used to unpack the list `ans` so that each element of `ans` is printed as a separate argument.

Given this analysis, the output will be the elements of the list `ans` printed one after another, without any additional formatting.

Output: **the elements of the list ans (where each element is calculated based on the conditions inside the loop)**
