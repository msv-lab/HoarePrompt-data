The function `func_2` accepts a string `s1` consisting of characters '<' and '>' and an integer `n` representing the length of `s1`. It calculates and returns a list `ans` of length `n`, where each element is determined based on the balance of '<' and '>' characters in `s1`. Specifically, for each character in `s1` from the end to the beginning, the function computes a value that reflects the difference between the number of zeros and ones under certain conditions, updating the list `ans` accordingly. After processing all characters, the function prints the list `ans`.
