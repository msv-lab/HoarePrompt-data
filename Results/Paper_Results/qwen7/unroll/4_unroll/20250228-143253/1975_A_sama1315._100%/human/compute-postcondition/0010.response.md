Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases, an integer `n` indicating the length of an array `a`, and the array `a` itself. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1` on array `a` and collects the results. Finally, it prints the results of `func_1` for each test case, each result on a new line.**
