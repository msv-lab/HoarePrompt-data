You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: idx is 2 + t, t is an integer equal to int(data[0]), results is a list containing t elements where each element is the result of calling func_1 on a list of integers.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: the results of `func_1` applied to a list of integers, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (number of test cases) such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, an integer `n` (length of the array) such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and an array `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operation on the array `a` and returns the results accordingly.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
