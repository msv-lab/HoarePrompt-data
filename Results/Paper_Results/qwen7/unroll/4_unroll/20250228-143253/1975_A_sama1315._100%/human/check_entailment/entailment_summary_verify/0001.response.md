### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that `func_1` is flawed because it checks if any subarray of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, which is not a reliable method to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. However, the original assessment concluded that the entire program is incorrect, which is not entirely accurate.

Let's re-evaluate the functions and the overall logic:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` indeed has a flaw in its logic. It checks if any subarray of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, which is not sufficient to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 1, 4, 5, 1, 4]`. Sorting it gives `[1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 5]`. While no subarray of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, the array can still be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads the input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It calls `func_1` for each test case, but since `func_1` is flawed, it may return incorrect results.

However, the original assessment concluded that the entire program is incorrect, which is not entirely accurate. The issue lies specifically with `func_1`, and `func_2` itself is logically sound in terms of reading and processing input.

To fix the program, we need to implement a correct algorithm in `func_1` that actually checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. One possible approach is to check if the array is already non-decreasing or if there exists a valid split point where the array can be rearranged to be non-decreasing.

### Corrected Approach for `func_1`

Here is a corrected version of `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] > a[i + 1]:
            # Check if the array can be split at index i and rearranged to be non-decreasing
            if a[:i+1] + a[i+1:] == sorted(a[:i+1] + a[i+1:]):
                return 'Yes'
            else:
                return 'No'
    return 'Yes'
```

With this corrected `func_1`, `func_2` remains unchanged and the program should work correctly.

### Final Evaluation

Since the original assessment did not account for the fact that `func_2` is logically sound in terms of reading and processing input, and only `func_1` needs correction, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect due to the flaw in `func_1`, but the overall structure of the program is logically sound.
