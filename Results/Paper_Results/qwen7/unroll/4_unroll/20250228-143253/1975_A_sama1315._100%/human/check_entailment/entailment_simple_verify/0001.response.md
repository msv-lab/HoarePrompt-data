### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the flaw in `func_1`. The logic in `func_1` is indeed incorrect because it checks if any subarray of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, which does not guarantee that the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. This approach fails to consider the necessary condition that the array must be able to be split into two parts such that one part is a prefix and the other is a suffix, and swapping them results in a non-decreasing array.

To properly solve this problem, we need to check if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part. This ensures that swapping the parts will result in a non-decreasing array.

Here is a corrected approach:

1. **Find the longest non-decreasing prefix.**
2. **Check if the remaining part (suffix) is non-decreasing.**
3. **Verify if the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix.**

If all these conditions are met, the array can be made non-decreasing by swapping the prefix and suffix.

### Corrected Code

```python
def can_become_non_decreasing(a):
    n = len(a)
    
    # Find the longest non-decreasing prefix
    prefix_end = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[i] < a[i - 1]:
            break
        prefix_end = i
    
    # Check if the remaining part is non-decreasing
    suffix_start = prefix_end + 1
    while suffix_start < n - 1:
        if a[suffix_start] > a[suffix_start + 1]:
            return 'No'
        suffix_start += 1
    
    # Check if the last element of the prefix is less than or equal to the first element of the suffix
    if prefix_end > 0 and a[prefix_end] > a[suffix_start]:
        return 'No'
    
    return 'Yes'

# Function 2 remains the same
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = can_become_non_decreasing(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()
```

### Final Evaluation

The original assessment was accurate in identifying the flaw in the logic of `func_1`. The corrected approach ensures that the array can be checked properly for the required conditions. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **True**
