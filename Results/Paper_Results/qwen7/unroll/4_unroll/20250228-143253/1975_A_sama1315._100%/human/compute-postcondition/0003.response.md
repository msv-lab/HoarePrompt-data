Output State: **`idx` is 1, `t` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of the first element in the list `data` (which is `data[0]`) converted to an integer to the variable `t`. Since `idx` was initially 0, after executing the line, `idx` is incremented by 1 (though this increment is not explicitly shown in the code, it is implied by the context). Therefore, `idx` becomes 1, and `t` is an integer equal to the value of `data[0]` converted to an integer.
