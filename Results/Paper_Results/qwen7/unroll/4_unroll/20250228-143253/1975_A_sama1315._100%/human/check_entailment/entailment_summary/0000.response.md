Reasoning:
1. The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. Function `func_1` is supposed to solve this problem by sorting the array and checking if any subsequence of the concatenated array (original array appended to itself) matches the sorted array. However, this approach is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the allowed operations (splitting and swapping).
3. Function `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The output hints indicate that `func_1` returns 'No' for all test cases, which means it does not correctly implement the required logic.
4. Given the problem description and the expected examples, the correct solution should check if the array can be split and swapped to achieve a non-decreasing order. A simple and effective way to do this is to check if the array is already non-decreasing or if it can be split at a point where the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-decreasing.

Since `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, and `func_2` relies on `func_1`, the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
