### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct.

2. **Score Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players in case of a draw). This check is necessary and correct.

3. **Invalid Score Configuration**: The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is incorrect. According to the problem statement, this condition should never be true since `p1 ≤ p2 ≤ p3`. Therefore, this part of the logic is flawed.

4. **Binary Search for Draws**: The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws using a binary search approach. However, the logic inside the loop is complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases. Specifically, the condition `if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` might not always accurately reflect the maximum number of draws possible.

5. **Final Output**: The program prints `p3` if it cannot find a valid configuration, which is incorrect based on the problem statement.

### Correctness:

Given the issues identified, particularly the flawed logic for handling the score configuration and the incorrect final output, the program is not correct.

**Correctness: False**
