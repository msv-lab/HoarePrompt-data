You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break

                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (p1, p2, p3), the program checks if their sum is even. If not, it prints -1 and continues to the next iteration. If the sum is even, it further checks if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2. If true, it prints p1 + p2. Otherwise, it calculates two values, low and high, based on p3, p1, and p2, and uses a while loop to find a value cur such that p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur). It then prints p1 - cur + p3. If no such cur is found, it prints p3.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points split between two players).

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - If `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the program prints `p1 + p2`. This is incorrect because it doesn't account for the possibility of draws. The correct logic should consider the maximum possible number of draws.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number of draws. It sets `low` and `high` based on the difference between `p3` and `p1` and `p3` and `p2`.
   - It iteratively checks if the current number of draws (`cur`) can satisfy the conditions for `p1` and `p2`.

5. **Breaking Conditions:**
   - If the current number of draws (`cur`) satisfies the condition where `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - If no valid number of draws is found, it prints `p3`.

### Issues Identified:
- The initial condition check (`if p3 >= p1 + p2`) is incorrect. This condition does not necessarily mean that no draws are possible.
- The binary search logic is overly complex and may not correctly handle all edge cases.
- The program does not properly account for the maximum number of draws that can occur.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:
- Calculate the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores.
- Determine the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring the total points are consistent.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games needed
        min_games = (total_points - 2 * p3) // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2) - min_games
        
        # Ensure the maximum number of draws is non-negative
        max_draws = max(0, max_draws)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The original program has several issues and does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is **incorrect**.
