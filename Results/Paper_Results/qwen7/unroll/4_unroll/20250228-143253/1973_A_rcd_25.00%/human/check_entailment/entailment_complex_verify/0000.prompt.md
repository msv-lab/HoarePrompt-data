You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):

                    cur += 1

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            low, high = min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2)
            cur = low
            while high >= cur:
                if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
                    print(p1 - cur + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    cur += 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (p1, p2, p3), the program checks if their sum is even. If not, it prints -1 and continues to the next iteration. If the sum is even, it further checks if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2. If true, it prints p1 + p2. Otherwise, it calculates two values, low and high, based on p3, p1, and p2, and uses a while loop to find a value cur such that p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur). It then prints p1 - cur + p3. If no such cur is found, it prints p3.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it first checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. If the sum is even, it further checks if \(p_3\) is greater than or equal to \(p_1 + p_2\). If true, it prints \(p_1 + p_2\). Otherwise, it finds a value \(cur\) such that \(p_1 - cur \leq p_2 - (p_3 - cur)\) and prints \(p_1 - cur + p_3\). If no such \(cur\) exists, it prints \(p_3\). The function outputs a series of numbers based on the conditions met by the input values for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to handle cases where the scores do not allow for any valid set of games and results. 

For example, consider the input `1 1 10`. According to the problem description, the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` must be consistent with a valid set of games. However, the current implementation does not check if the scores are logically consistent. For instance, if `p1 = 1`, `p2 = 1`, and `p3 = 10`, it is impossible to achieve these scores through any combination of wins, losses, and draws, as the maximum score a player can achieve without any draws is 2 (from winning one game). Therefore, the output should be `-1` for this case, but the program incorrectly prints `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to include a check to ensure that the scores are logically consistent before attempting to calculate the maximum number of draws.
