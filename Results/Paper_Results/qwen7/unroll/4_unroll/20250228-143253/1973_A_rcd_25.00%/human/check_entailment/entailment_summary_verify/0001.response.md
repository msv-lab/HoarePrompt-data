### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the given program and the provided function summary to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total points must be even for the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points split between two players).

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The initial condition check `if p3 >= p1 + p2` is indeed incorrect. This condition does not necessarily mean that no draws are possible. We need to consider the possibility of draws and ensure that the total points are consistent.

4. **Binary Search for Maximum Draws:**
   - The binary search logic is designed to find the maximum number of draws. However, the implementation is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for setting `low` and `high` and the condition inside the loop needs to be carefully analyzed.

5. **Breaking Conditions:**
   - The program attempts to find a valid number of draws `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. If a valid `cur` is found, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop. If no valid `cur` is found, it prints `p3`.

### Issues Identified:
- The initial condition check is incorrect and does not account for the possibility of draws.
- The binary search logic is overly complex and may not handle all edge cases correctly.
- The program does not properly account for the maximum number of draws that can occur.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to:
- Calculate the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores.
- Determine the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring the total points are consistent.

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum number of games needed
        min_games = (total_points - 2 * p3) // 2
        
        # Calculate the maximum number of draws
        max_draws = (p3 - p1) + (p3 - p2) - min_games
        
        # Ensure the maximum number of draws is non-negative
        max_draws = max(0, max_draws)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Explanation:
- **Total Points Check:** Ensure the total points are even.
- **Minimum Games Calculation:** Calculate the minimum number of games required to achieve the given scores.
- **Maximum Draws Calculation:** Determine the maximum number of draws by considering the constraints and ensuring the total points are consistent.

### Conclusion:
The original program has several issues and does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. The corrected program addresses these issues and provides the correct logic to find the maximum number of draws.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
