Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (p1, p2, p3), if the sum (p1 + p2 + p3) is even and p3 is less than p1 + p2, the output will be p1 + p2. Otherwise, if p3 is greater than or equal to p1 + p2, it will check the conditions within the while loop to find a suitable value for printing. If no suitable value is found, it will print p3. The final output state will be a list of outputs from each iteration, either -1, p1 + p2, p1 - cur + p3, or p3, where cur is determined by the conditions in the while loop.
