Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.
2. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and moves to the next test case. This is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules.
3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the only way to achieve these scores is if there were no draws and the first two players won all their games against the third player.
4. **Draw Calculation**: If `p3 < p1 + p2`, the program calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between `p3` and `p1`, `p2`. It then tries to find a value `cur` such that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`. This logic aims to maximize the number of draws. The program increments `cur` until it finds a suitable value or exhausts its search. If no such `cur` is found, it prints `p3`, which is correct because it means the scores cannot be achieved with any number of draws.
5. **Output**: The program correctly handles all given examples and edge cases as per the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
