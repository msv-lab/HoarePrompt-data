Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
3. It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd total score is impossible given the scoring rules (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total in case of a draw).
4. If the sum is even, it checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2` because this would mean no draws occurred (each game was a win/loss scenario).
5. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, it calculates `low` and `high` based on the differences between the scores. It then tries to find a value `cur` such that the difference in scores between the players can be balanced out with draws. This logic is designed to maximize the number of draws.
6. The program correctly handles the constraints and edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
