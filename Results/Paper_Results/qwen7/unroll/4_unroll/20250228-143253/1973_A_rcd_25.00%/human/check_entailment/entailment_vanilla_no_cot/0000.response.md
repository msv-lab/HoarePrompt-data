Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Handling of Draw Points**: The program does not correctly handle the points distribution for draws. In a draw, both players get 1 point each. The current logic does not account for this properly.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The logic to calculate the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current approach does not ensure that the points are distributed correctly among the players considering the constraints of draws and wins.

3. **Edge Cases**: The solution does not handle edge cases correctly, such as when the sum of the points is odd (which should always result in -1).

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the minimum points required for the third player to win or draw
        min_points_for_p3 = max(0, p3 - (p1 + p2))
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible draws
        max_draws = 0
        for d in range(min_points_for_p3 + 1):
            remaining_points = p3 - d
            if (remaining_points + p1 - d) % 2 == 0:
                wins_for_p1 = (remaining_points + p1 - d) // 2
                wins_for_p2 = (remaining_points + p2 - d) // 2
                if wins_for_p1 + wins_for_p2 + d == p3:
                    max_draws = max(max_draws, d)
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the points are distributed correctly and handles the constraints of draws and wins appropriately.
