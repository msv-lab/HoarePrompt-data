Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the constraints provided for t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. Specifically, t is a positive integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and p_1, p_2, and p_3 are non-negative integers where 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30. The function does not use these constraints within its body but rather uses them to define the valid range of inputs for other operations or calculations that might be performed elsewhere.**
