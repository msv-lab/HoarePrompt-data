Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the dimensions `a` and `b` of the rectangle.

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - The program checks if both `a` and `b` are odd (`a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0`). If true, it prints "NO". This condition is correct because if both dimensions are odd, cutting the rectangle along either dimension will result in two smaller odd-dimensional rectangles, which cannot form a new distinct rectangle.
   - The program also checks if `a / 2 == b` or `b / 2 == a`. If true, it prints "NO". This condition is not entirely correct because it only considers specific cases where one dimension is exactly half of the other, but it does not cover all cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

3. **Condition for "YES"**:
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This implies that any other combination of `a` and `b` will allow forming a new rectangle, which is not always true.

### Example Analysis:

- **Test Case 1**: `1 1`
  - Both dimensions are 1, which are odd. Correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case 2**: `2 1`
  - One dimension is even, and the other is odd. Correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case 3**: `2 6`
  - One dimension is even, and the other is even. Correctly outputs "YES".
- **Test Case 4**: `3 2`
  - Both dimensions are odd. Correctly outputs "NO".
- **Test Case 5**: `2 2`
  - Both dimensions are even, but `a / 2 == b`. Incorrectly outputs "NO" (should output "YES").
- **Test Case 6**: `2 4`
  - One dimension is even, and the other is even. Correctly outputs "YES".
- **Test Case 7**: `6 3`
  - Both dimensions are even. Correctly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:

The program incorrectly identifies some cases as "NO" when they should be "YES". Specifically, it fails to recognize that if both dimensions are even and one is not exactly half of the other, a new rectangle can still be formed.

### Correctness:

**False**

The program needs to be revised to handle all valid cases correctly.
