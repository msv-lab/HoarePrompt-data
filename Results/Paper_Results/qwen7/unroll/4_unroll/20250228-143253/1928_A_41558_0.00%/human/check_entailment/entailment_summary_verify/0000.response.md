Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and compare its behavior with the problem description and the function summary.

### Analysis of the Program

The program `func()` processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers \(a\) and \(b\). It performs the following checks:
1. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'NO'.
2. If \(a/2\) equals \(b\) or \(b/2\) equals \(a\), it prints 'NO'.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

### Problem Description and Function Summary

According to the problem description and the function summary, the program should:
1. Check if both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd.
2. Check if one dimension is exactly half of the other.
3. If neither of the above conditions is met, it should print 'YES'.

However, the program does not handle the case where both dimensions are even. According to the problem statement, if both dimensions are even, Bob can always cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and reassemble them into a different rectangle. 

### Example Test Case: \(2 \times 4\)

- Both dimensions are even.
- The program should output "YES" because Bob can cut the \(2 \times 4\) rectangle into two \(2 \times 2\) rectangles and reassemble them into a \(4 \times 2\) rectangle.
- However, the program outputs "NO" because it does not account for the case where both dimensions are even.

### Correctness of the Program

The original assessment correctly points out that the program fails to handle the case where both dimensions are even. The program's logic is incomplete and does not cover all possible scenarios as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program is indeed incorrect because it does not handle the case where both dimensions are even, which is a valid scenario according to the problem description.

Final: **False**
