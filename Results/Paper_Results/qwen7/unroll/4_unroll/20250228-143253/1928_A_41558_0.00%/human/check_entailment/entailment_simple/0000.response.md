Reasoning:

To determine if the given Python program is correct, we need to verify whether the logic inside the `func` function correctly identifies whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle according to the problem statement.

Let's analyze the logic step-by-step:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `n` and processes each test case by reading pairs of integers \(a\) and \(b\).

2. **Conditions for "NO"**:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd (`a % 2 != 0` and `b % 2 != 0`), then the program prints "NO". This condition is correct because an odd-sized rectangle cannot be split into two smaller rectangles with integer sides without leaving a 1x1 square that cannot be recombined into a different rectangle.
   - If either \(a / 2\) equals \(b\) or \(b / 2\) equals \(a\), the program also prints "NO". This condition is correct because if one dimension is exactly half of the other, splitting the rectangle along that dimension results in two identical smaller rectangles, which cannot be rearranged into a different rectangle.

3. **Condition for "YES"**: 
   - If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints "YES". This means that the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles that can be rearranged into a different rectangle. This condition is correct based on the problem statement and examples provided.

Given the analysis, the logic in the program correctly implements the rules specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program should produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
