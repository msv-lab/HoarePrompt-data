Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where the path can switch between rows and columns optimally to achieve the smallest lexicographical order.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
4
1101
1100
8
00100111
11101101
```

The expected output is:
```
11000
1
001001101
4
```

However, the program's output for the second test case is incorrect. The program does not account for the possibility of switching between rows and columns to achieve the smallest lexicographical order. For example, in the second test case, the optimal path to achieve the smallest string `001001101` involves switching between rows and columns, which the current implementation does not handle correctly.

To fix this, the program needs to consider both possible paths (right and down) and choose the one that results in the smallest lexicographical order. This requires dynamic programming or a similar approach to keep track of the minimum values and the number of ways to achieve them.
