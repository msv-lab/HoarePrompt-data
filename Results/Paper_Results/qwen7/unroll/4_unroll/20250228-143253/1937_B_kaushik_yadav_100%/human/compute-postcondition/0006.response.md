Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of binary strings), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by selectively appending characters from `a` and `b` based on specific conditions. After constructing `ans`, it prints the string and then counts the number of consecutive matching characters between `a` and `b` under certain conditions, printing the count. The function updates the input `t` to the next test case and repeats the process until all test cases are processed.**
