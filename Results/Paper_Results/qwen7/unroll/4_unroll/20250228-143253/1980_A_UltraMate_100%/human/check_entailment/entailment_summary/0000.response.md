Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems.
3. It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create.
4. It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the string `s`.
5. For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G':
   - If the difficulty level is not present in `s`, it adds `m` to `ans` because Vlad needs to create all `m` problems for this difficulty level.
   - If the difficulty level is present in `s`, it checks how many problems are missing to reach `m` problems for that difficulty level and adds this difference to `ans`.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `ans`.

Given the execution summary, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
