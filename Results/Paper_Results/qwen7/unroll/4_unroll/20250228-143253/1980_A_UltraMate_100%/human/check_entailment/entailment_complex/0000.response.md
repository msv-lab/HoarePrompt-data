Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the string `s` representing the difficulties of the existing problems.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of additional problems needed.

3. **Character Count Calculation**: It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G') in the string `s`.

4. **Calculation of Additional Problems Needed**:
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', if the level is not present in `s`, `ans` is incremented by `m` (since Vlad needs at least one problem of each type).
   - If the level is present but the count is less than `m`, `ans` is incremented by the difference (`m - count_of_i`).

5. **Output**: The result `ans` is printed for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the logic appears to be correct and matches the requirements. The code handles all edge cases, including when certain difficulty levels are missing from the initial set of problems.

Correctness: **True**
