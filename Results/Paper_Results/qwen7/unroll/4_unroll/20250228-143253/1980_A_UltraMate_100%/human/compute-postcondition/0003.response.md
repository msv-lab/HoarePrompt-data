Output State: **t is the number of test cases, and for each test case, t is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'G', and ans is the calculated value based on the conditions given in the loop. The final output is the value of ans for each test case.**

This means that after all iterations of the loop, for each test case, the variable `ans` will hold the calculated value based on the input `n`, `m`, and string `s`. The output state describes the final values of these variables after processing all test cases.
