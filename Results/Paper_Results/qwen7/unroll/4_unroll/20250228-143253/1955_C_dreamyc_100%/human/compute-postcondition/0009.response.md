Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, `b` is `k // 2`, `ans` is the sum of all indices `i` for which either the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements of `nums` is less than or equal to `b`.
