Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2 * 10^5 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^15, `nums` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, `a` is `math.ceil(k / 2)`, and `b` is `k // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates two new variables `a` and `b` from the values of `k`. Specifically, `a` is set to the ceiling of `k / 2`, which means if `k` is even, `a` is `k / 2`, and if `k` is odd, `a` is `(k + 1) / 2`. Variable `b` is set to the floor division of `k` by 2, which is simply `k // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
