Output State: **The program returns a string consisting of the first k characters of 's' repeated n times.**

Given the initial state where `s` is a string containing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', the code snippet `return s[:k] * n` will slice the string `s` from the beginning up to the index `k` (excluding `k` itself) and repeat this substring `n` times. The exact output will depend on the values of `k` and `n`.
