Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), followed by pairs of integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5) for each t, and binary strings a and b of lengths n and m respectively. The function returns a result for each test case based on the given inputs.**

Note: The actual processing logic and return values are not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing how the function operates.
