Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \( t \), \( n \), and \( m \). It checks if \( n \) can be divided into \( k \) parts such that each part is less than or equal to \( m \). If possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function reads \( t \) test cases from the standard input, performs the check for each case, and prints the result for each case.**
