### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice paints the ribbon with \( n \) parts using \( m \) colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most \( k \) parts to the same color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Key Conditions for "YES":**
   - Alice needs to ensure that no single color appears more than \( k \) times on the ribbon. If this condition is met, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color.

3. **Analysis of the Given Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( m \), and \( k \).
   - It checks two conditions:
     - `if n <= k`: If \( n \leq k \), Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so the answer is 'NO'.
     - `if n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the maximum number of parts painted with the same color (which is \( \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil \)) is less than \( k \). If true, Bob cannot repaint enough parts to make all parts the same color, so the answer is 'Yes'.

4. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The condition `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` is not correctly formulated to ensure Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color.
   - Instead, Alice should aim to distribute the colors such that no color appears more than \( k \) times. This means \( \lceil \frac{n}{m} \rceil > k \) should be checked.

5. **Correct Condition:**
   - The correct condition should be `if math.ceil(n / m) > k`, which ensures that no single color can appear more than \( k \) times.

6. **Corrected Code:**
   ```python
   def func():
       t = int(input())
       for itest in range(0, t, 1):
           (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
           if n <= k or math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
               print('NO')
           else:
               print('Yes')
   ```

7. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function checks if \( n \) can be divided into \( k \) parts such that each part is less than or equal to \( m \). This is not the correct interpretation of the problem. The function should check if the distribution of colors ensures that no color appears more than \( k \) times.

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The original code is incorrect because it does not properly check if Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. The corrected logic should be `if math.ceil(n / m) > k`.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
