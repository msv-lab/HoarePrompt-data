Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating over each test case and checking if the sum of the scores \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1`, indicating an inconsistency. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\).

Let's break down the logic:

1. **Sum Check**: The sum of the scores must be even because each game contributes either 2 points (to one player) or 2 points in total (in case of a draw).
2. **Formula Explanation**:
   - \(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]\) represents the total points scored by all three players.
   - \(\max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])\) ensures that we do not subtract more than what is available from \(v[0]\) and \(v[1]\).
   - The division by 2 accounts for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total.

Given the constraints and the logic, the program should correctly identify when the scores are inconsistent and calculate the maximum number of draws when they are consistent.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws. The formula \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\) might not always yield the correct maximum number of draws. Specifically, this formula does not account for the possibility that some of the points could come from wins rather than draws.

To ensure correctness, we need to consider the following:
- The maximum number of draws can be calculated by ensuring that the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores is minimized while keeping the total points even.

The provided solution does not fully address this requirement. A more accurate approach would involve checking the feasibility of the scores and calculating the maximum number of draws based on the possible distribution of wins and draws.

Given the current implementation, the program might not handle all edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
