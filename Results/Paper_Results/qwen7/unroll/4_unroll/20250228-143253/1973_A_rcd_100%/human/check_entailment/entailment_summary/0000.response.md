Reasoning:
1. The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the scoring rules.
2. The condition `if p3 >= p1 + p2` ensures that the highest score is not impossible to achieve without any draws. This is a necessary check before attempting to find a solution involving draws.
3. The nested while loop tries to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x` equals `p2 - y` and `p3`. This approach is aimed at finding the maximum number of draws by balancing the scores of the players.
4. The logic for calculating the number of draws seems to be based on the idea that each draw adds 1 point to both players, thus reducing the difference in their scores. However, the implementation might need some adjustments to ensure it correctly calculates the maximum number of draws.

After reviewing the logic, I notice that the current implementation might not handle all edge cases correctly, particularly when the scores do not allow for any valid distribution of wins and draws. For instance, the example `1 1 10` should indeed result in `-1` since no combination of wins and draws can produce these scores.

However, the core logic for checking the sum being even and ensuring `p3` does not exceed `p1 + p2` is correct. The while loop for finding the maximum number of draws needs refinement but does not fundamentally alter the correctness of the overall approach.

Correctness: **False**

The program should be adjusted to ensure it handles all edge cases properly, especially those where the scores are inconsistent with the game rules.
