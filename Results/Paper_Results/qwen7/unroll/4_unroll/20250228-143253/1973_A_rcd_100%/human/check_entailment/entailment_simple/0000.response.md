Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` immediately, which is correct because the sum must be even for the scores to be achievable.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program handles the edge case where `p3 >= p1 + p2` by directly printing `p1 + p2`. This is correct because if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`, the maximum number of draws can be achieved without any wins, meaning all points are from draws.
4. **General Case Handling**: In the general case, the program attempts to find a combination of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x = p2 - y` and `x + y` is maximized. This logic is designed to maximize the number of draws. However, the implementation has some issues:
   - The while loop condition `y >= x` is incorrect. It should be `y >= x + 1` to ensure that `x` and `y` are incremented properly.
   - The logic inside the loop needs to be adjusted to correctly find the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the loop should increment `x` and decrement `y` until `p1 - x <= p2 - y` or until `x > y`.
5. **Output Handling**: The program outputs the correct values for the given examples, but the logic for finding the maximum number of draws needs to be corrected.

Given these observations, the program is almost correct but has an error in the logic for finding the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
