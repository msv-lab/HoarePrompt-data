Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 500, the same range applies after the code execution. The values of `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code.
