Output State: The output state will consist of a series of values printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` will be printed. Otherwise, if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, `p1 + p2` will be printed. If `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`, the loop will attempt to find values of `x` and `y` such that `p1 - x + p3` is printed when `y >= x` and `p1 - x <= p2 - y`. If no such values exist, `p3` will be printed. The exact sequence of outputs depends on the input values for each iteration.
