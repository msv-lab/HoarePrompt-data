Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is the first integer input split by space; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; `a` is the string input from the user; `b` is the next string input from the user; `k` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `k` to 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
