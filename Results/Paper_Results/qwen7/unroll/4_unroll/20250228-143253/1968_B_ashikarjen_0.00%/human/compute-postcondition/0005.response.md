Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**:
   - The variable `i` will start at 0 and increment by 1 in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Check the given state before the loop**:
   - `j` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) (not relevant to the loop).
   - `n` is the first integer input split by space.
   - `m` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) (not relevant to the loop).
   - `a` is the string input from the user (not relevant to the loop).
   - `b` is the next string input from the user (not relevant to the loop).
   - `k` is 0 (not relevant to the loop).

4. **Adjust the necessary states**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (since `range(n)` requires `n` to be non-negative).
   - The variable `i` should start at 0, which is the default value when using `range(n)`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be a positive integer (non-zero).

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`n` must be a positive integer**
