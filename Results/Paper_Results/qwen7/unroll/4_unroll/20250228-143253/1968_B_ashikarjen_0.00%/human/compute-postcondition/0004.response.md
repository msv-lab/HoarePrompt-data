Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is the first integer input split by space, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `a` is the string input from the user, `b` is the next string input from the user, `k` is 0.**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
