Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively, and calculates the number of characters in `a` that have a matching character in `b` at the same position. It prints the count of such matching characters for each test case. If no matches are found, it prints `0`. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
