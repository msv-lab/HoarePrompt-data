State: **`t` must be a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 1000, _ is not relevant as it is a dummy variable**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable and does not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted.
- The variable `t` is crucial because the loop runs `t` times. Since `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, it must be a positive integer within the specified range (1 <= t <= 1000) for the loop to execute.
