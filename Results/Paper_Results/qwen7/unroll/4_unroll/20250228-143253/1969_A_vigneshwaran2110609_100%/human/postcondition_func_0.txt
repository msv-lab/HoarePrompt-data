The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a list p of n distinct integers (1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i). For each test case, it reads the list p and checks if p[p[i] - 1] equals i + 1 for any i in the range 0 to x-1, where x is another integer input. If the condition is met for any i, it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3. The function does not return any value but outputs a series of 2's or 3's based on the condition check for each test case.
