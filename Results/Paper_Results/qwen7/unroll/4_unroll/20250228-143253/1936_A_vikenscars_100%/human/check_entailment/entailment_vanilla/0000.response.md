Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function prints a query and reads the response from the judge.
   - It correctly handles flushing the output after printing the query.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - The function starts by finding the index with the highest single bit set (using bitwise OR with itself).
     - For each index \(i\) from 1 to \(n-1\), it compares \(p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i\) with \(p_i \mid p_i\).
     - If \(p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_i < p_i \mid p_i\), it updates `max_item_idx` to \(i\).
   - After identifying the index with the highest single bit set, it tries to find another index \(j\) such that \(p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_j\) is maximized.
     - It iterates through all indices and uses the previously identified index to compare against each other index.
     - If \(p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_j < p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \mid p_j\), it updates `pair_idx` to \(j\).
     - If \(p_{\text{max\_item\_idx}} \mid p_j = p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \mid p_j\), it further checks if \(p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \mid p_{\text{pair\_idx}} < p_j \mid p_j\) to ensure \(p_{\text{pair\_idx}} \mid p_j\) is indeed the maximum.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Incorrect Maximization Strategy**:
   - The strategy used in `func_2` to find the maximum XOR might not always work. Specifically, the approach of comparing single-bit indices and then trying to maximize the OR result might not guarantee the maximum XOR.
   - The program assumes that the index with the highest single bit set will lead to the maximum XOR, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Query Count**:
   - The program makes a fixed number of queries (up to \(3n\)), but the strategy used might not always find the optimal pair within these constraints.

3. **Handling Ties**:
   - The program does not handle ties properly when checking for the maximum XOR. It only considers the OR result, which might not always lead to the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program does not have a robust strategy to ensure it finds the optimal pair of indices with the maximum XOR. Therefore, it is likely to fail in some test cases.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
