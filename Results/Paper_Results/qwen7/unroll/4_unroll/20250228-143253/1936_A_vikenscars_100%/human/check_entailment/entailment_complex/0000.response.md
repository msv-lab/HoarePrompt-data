### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. The allowed operations are comparing the results of bitwise ORs of pairs of elements from the permutation.

2. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**: This function correctly formats and sends a query to the judge and waits for the response. The response is used to update the state of the program.

3. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**: This function aims to find the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` such that \(p_{max\_item\_idx} \oplus p_{pair\_idx}\) is maximized.
   - **Step 1**: It initializes `max_item_idx` to 0 and iterates through the permutation to find an index where the bitwise OR of the index with itself is less than the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with itself. This step ensures that `max_item_idx` is set to an index that is likely to have a high value when compared via bitwise OR.
   - **Step 2**: It then iterates through the entire permutation again to find `pair_idx`. For each element, it checks if the bitwise OR of `max_item_idx` with itself is less than the bitwise OR of the current element with itself. If so, it updates `pair_idx`. If the bitwise ORs are equal, it further checks if the bitwise OR of `pair_idx` with itself is greater than the bitwise OR of the current element with itself. If so, it updates `pair_idx`.

4. **Query Count**: The function uses a total of \(2n + 1\) queries (one initial query to find `max_item_idx` and \(2(n-1)\) queries to find `pair_idx`). Since \(2n + 1 \leq 3n\) for \(n \geq 2\), the function stays within the allowed query limit.

5. **Output**: The function prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx` in the required format.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized within the allowed query limit. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
