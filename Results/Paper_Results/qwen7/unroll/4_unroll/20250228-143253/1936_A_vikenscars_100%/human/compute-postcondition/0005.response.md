Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`.
   - `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which the condition `func_1(i, i, max_item_idx, max_item_idx) == '<'` holds true, or remains 0 if no such index exists.

3. **Understand the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[0, n)`. 

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on `i` and `n`, these are the variables that need to be adjusted.
   - The value of `pair_idx` and `max_item_idx` does not directly affect the loop's execution but should remain consistent with their definitions.

5. **Formulate the Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that the loop can start and execute properly. This means `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), and `i` should start from 0.
   - `pair_idx` and `max_item_idx` should be consistent with their definitions.

Given this analysis, the final state should be:

**State: **`pair_idx` is equal to `max_item_idx`, `max_item_idx` is the index `i` for which the condition `func_1(i, i, max_item_idx, max_item_idx) == '<'` holds true, or remains 0 if no such index exists, `i` is 0, and `n` must be greater than 0**.
