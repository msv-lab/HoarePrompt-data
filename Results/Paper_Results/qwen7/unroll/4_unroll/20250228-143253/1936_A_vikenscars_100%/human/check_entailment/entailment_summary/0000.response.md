### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to ensure it meets the requirements of the problem.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The main loop iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_2(n)` with the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function is responsible for making a query to the judge.
   - It constructs a query string and prints it to the standard output.
   - It then reads the judge's response and returns it.
   - The function works correctly as per the problem statement.

3. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function aims to find the pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized.
   - The function initializes `max_item_idx` to 0.
   - It iterates through the indices from 1 to `n-1` and uses `func_1` to compare `(p[max_item_idx] | p[i])` with `(p[i] | p[i])`.
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `max_item_idx` to `i`.
   - After finding `max_item_idx`, it iterates through all indices again to find `pair_idx` such that `(p[max_item_idx] | p[pair_idx])` is maximized.
     - If the response is `<`, it updates `pair_idx` to `i`.
     - If the response is `=`, it further checks with `func_1` to ensure `(p[pair_idx] | p[pair_idx])` is greater than `(p[i] | p[i])`, updating `pair_idx` accordingly.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

### Analysis:
- The logic in `func_2` ensures that `max_item_idx` is set to the index of the element that maximizes the bitwise OR with itself when compared to other elements.
- The subsequent loop ensures that `pair_idx` is the index that maximizes the bitwise XOR with `max_item_idx`.
- The approach is sound and leverages the properties of bitwise operations to find the optimal pair.
- The number of queries used is within the limit of `3n` as required by the problem.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

### Conclusion:
**Correctness: True**

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions.
