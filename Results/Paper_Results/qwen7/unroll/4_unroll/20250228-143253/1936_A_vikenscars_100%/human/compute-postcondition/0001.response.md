State: **`max_item_idx` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. For the loop to execute, `i` should start from 1 and `n` should be greater than 1 (since the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`).
3. The initial value of `max_item_idx` (which is 0) does not affect the loop's execution conditions directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` to 1 and `n` to be greater than 1.
