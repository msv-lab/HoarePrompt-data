Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Conditions:**
   - The condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` incorrectly handles cases where the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, leading to an incorrect "No" output.
   - The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the number of cubes, which is a necessary condition but not sufficient. It fails to handle cases where the number of moves is even and the number of cubes is odd, or vice versa.

2. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs "YES" and "NO" without proper capitalization, which might lead to incorrect outputs according to the problem statement.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        if b >= c and (b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected program:
- Checks if the number of moves (`b`) is greater than or equal to the number of cubes (`c`).
- Ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the number of cubes is even, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the problem.
