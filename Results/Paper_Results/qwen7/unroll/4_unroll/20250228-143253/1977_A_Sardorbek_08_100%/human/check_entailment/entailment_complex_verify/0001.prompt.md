You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The little boy Nikita was given some cubes as a present. He decided to build a
tower out of them.

Initially, the tower doesn't have any cubes. In one move, Nikita either puts
exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of
the tower. Is it possible that after n moves, the resulting tower has exactly
m cubes?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n, m \le
100 ).

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if Nikita can obtain a tower
with m cubes, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3 3
    
    2 4
    
    5 3

Output

    Yes
    No
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, Nikita can put 1 cube on top of the tower 3 times in a
row, so the answer is "Yes".

In the second test case, Nikita can only end up with either a tower with no
blocks or a tower with 2 blocks, so the answer is "No".

- Program: 
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        q = (b, c)
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and each test case consists of two positive integers n and m such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        q = b, c
        
        if b == c:
            print('YES')
        elif b < c:
            print('NO')
        elif b % 2 == c % 2:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No' printed based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration from 0 to a-1. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the input values provided for 'b' and 'c' in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `b` and `c`. It prints one of four possible responses ('YES', 'NO', 'Yes', or 'No') for each test case based on the relationship between `b` and `c`. If `b` equals `c`, it prints 'YES'. If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO'. If `b` and `c` have the same parity (both even or both odd), it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function does not return any value but modifies the console output by printing the results of each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves.

3. **Conditions Checked:**
   - **Condition 1:** `b == c`
     - If the number of moves (`b`) is equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), it prints 'YES'.
   - **Condition 2:** `b < c`
     - If the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it prints 'NO'. This condition is incorrect because it's not possible to have more cubes than moves.
   - **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2`
     - This condition checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes. If they match, it prints 'Yes'. However, this condition alone is not sufficient to determine the possibility.
   - **Else Condition:** If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'No'.

### Detailed Analysis

- **Condition 1:** `b == c` is correct. If the number of moves equals the number of cubes, it's possible to achieve the desired state.
- **Condition 2:** `b < c` is incorrect. It's impossible to have more cubes than moves, so this condition should never be true.
- **Condition 3:** `b % 2 == c % 2` is partially correct but insufficient. It correctly identifies whether the number of moves and cubes have the same parity, but it does not fully account for the possibility of achieving the desired number of cubes through a series of additions and subtractions.

### Correct Approach

To correctly determine if it's possible to have `c` cubes after `b` moves, we need to check if `c` can be expressed as `b + k` where `k` is even (since each move adds or removes 1 cube).

### Revised Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0 and b >= c:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

# Example usage
func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

- **Condition 1:** `abs(b - c) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between the number of moves and the desired number of cubes is even.
- **Condition 2:** `b >= c` ensures that the number of moves is at least as many as the desired number of cubes.

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors and does not fully address the problem requirements. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
