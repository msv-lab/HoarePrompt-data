Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly handles the logic for calculating the minimum cost for each test case.
- It processes each test case individually, which is appropriate given the problem statement.
- The logic inside the loop is correct:
  - For `n > 1`, it calculates two possible costs: 
    - `ans1 = a * n` (cost without using the promotion).
    - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2` (cost using the promotion for as many pairs of yogurts as possible, plus the cost for any remaining yogurt).
  - It then prints the minimum of these two values.
  - For `n == 1`, it simply prints the cost of one yogurt (`a`).
- The overall structure of the program matches the problem requirements and the provided example input and output.
- There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
