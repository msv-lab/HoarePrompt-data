Output State: The output state consists of a series of minimum values printed for each test case. For each test case, if \( n > 1 \), the value printed is the minimum between \( a \times n \) and \( b \times n // 2 + a \times n \% 2 \). If \( n = 1 \), the value printed is simply \( a \). The number of these printed values equals the number of test cases specified by the first input.
