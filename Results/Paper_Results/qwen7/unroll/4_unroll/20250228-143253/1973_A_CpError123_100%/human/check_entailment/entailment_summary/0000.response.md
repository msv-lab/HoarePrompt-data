Reasoning:
- The program correctly checks if the total score (sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\)) is even. If not, it prints \(-1\) because an odd total score cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it ends in a draw).
- The calculation of \(x\) as \((a + b + c) // 2\) is correct since the maximum number of points distributed among the three players must be even.
- The variable \(y\) is calculated as the sum of the points of the two lowest-scoring players (\(a + b\)). This value represents the maximum possible points from games where one player wins and the other loses.
- The function then prints the minimum of \(x\) and \(y\), which is the maximum possible number of draws. This is because each draw contributes 1 point to each of the two players involved, and the maximum number of draws is limited by the smaller of the two values.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the program, it aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
