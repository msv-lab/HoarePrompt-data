State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, and t is greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop is defined as `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` requires `t` to be a non-negative integer.
3. Additionally, since `t` is specified to be between 1 and 500, it must fall within this range.
4. The initial state mentions that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute unless `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 and must be greater than 0.
