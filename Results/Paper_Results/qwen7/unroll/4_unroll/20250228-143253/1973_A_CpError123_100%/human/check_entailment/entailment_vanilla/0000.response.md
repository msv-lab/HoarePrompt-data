Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the scores of the three players.

2. **Checking Parity:**
   - The program checks if the sum `(a + b + c)` is even. This is necessary because the total points must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 1 point to each player in a draw.
   - If the sum is odd, the program prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This check is correct according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculating Total Points:**
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This represents the total number of games played, as each game contributes 2 points (or 1 point to each player in a draw).
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`. This represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.

4. **Determining Maximum Draws:**
   - The program prints `min(x, y)`, which is intended to represent the maximum possible number of draws.
   - However, this logic is flawed. The correct approach should consider the distribution of points among the players and ensure that the scores are consistent with the rules of the game.

### Example Analysis:

Let's manually check the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **Example 1:** `0 0 0`
  - Sum is `0`, which is even.
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0`.
  - `min(0, 0) = 0`.
  - Correct output: `0`.

- **Example 2:** `0 1 1`
  - Sum is `2`, which is even.
  - `x = 1`, `y = 1`.
  - `min(1, 1) = 1`.
  - Correct output: `1`.

- **Example 3:** `1 1 1`
  - Sum is `3`, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Example 4:** `1 1 2`
  - Sum is `4`, which is even.
  - `x = 2`, `y = 2`.
  - `min(2, 2) = 2`.
  - Correct output: `2`.

- **Example 5:** `3 3 3`
  - Sum is `9`, which is odd.
  - Correct output: `-1`.

- **Example 6:** `3 4 5`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 7`.
  - `min(6, 7) = 6`.
  - Correct output: `6`.

- **Example 7:** `1 1 10`
  - Sum is `12`, which is even.
  - `x = 6`, `y = 2`.
  - `min(6, 2) = 2`.
  - Correct output: `2`.

### Conclusion:

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. The logic `min(x, y)` is incorrect because it does not account for the distribution of points among the players. Therefore, the program will produce incorrect results for many test cases.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
