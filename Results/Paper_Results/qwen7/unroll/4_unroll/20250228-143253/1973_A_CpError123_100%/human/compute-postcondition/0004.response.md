Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is even. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). Otherwise, it calculates two values: \(x\) as half the sum of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (rounded down), and \(y\) as the sum of \(a\) and \(b\). It then prints the smaller of these two values. The function reads the number of test cases from the input and repeats this process for each test case.**
