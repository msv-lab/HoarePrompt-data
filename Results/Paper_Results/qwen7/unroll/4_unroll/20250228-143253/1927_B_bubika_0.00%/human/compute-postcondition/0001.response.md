Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; b is a list of 26 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with 26 elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `a`. Therefore, the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged, while `b` is now a list of 26 zeros.
