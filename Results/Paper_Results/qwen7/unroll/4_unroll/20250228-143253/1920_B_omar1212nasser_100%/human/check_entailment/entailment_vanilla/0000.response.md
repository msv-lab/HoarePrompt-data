Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`.
   - It then reads the array `a` and sorts it.
   - Finally, it calls `func_2` with the sorted array and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function takes three parameters: `removals` (number of elements Alice can remove), `negatives` (number of elements Bob can multiply by -1), and `elements` (the sorted array).
   - It initializes a list `pos` to store possible sums after optimal moves.
   - It calculates the initial sum of the array (`s`).
   - It appends the initial sum minus twice the sum of the last `negatives` elements to `pos`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `removals`:
     - In each iteration, it updates `s` by subtracting the current largest element.
     - It updates `s2` (sum of the last `negatives` elements) by subtracting the current largest element.
     - If the number of elements removed plus the number of elements multiplied by -1 is within bounds, it adds the current largest element back to `s2`.
     - It appends the updated `s` minus twice the updated `s2` to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in `pos`.

### Verification of Correctness

1. **Sorting the Array**:
   - Sorting the array helps in considering the smallest elements for removal and the largest elements for negation, which aligns with the optimal strategy for both players.

2. **Calculating Possible Sums**:
   - The function correctly considers all possible combinations of elements removed by Alice and negated by Bob.
   - It ensures that the sum of the array is calculated optimally by considering different scenarios where Alice removes up to `k` elements and Bob negates up to `x` elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases such as when Alice removes all elements or when Bob negates all elements.
   - It correctly updates the sum and the sum of the last `negatives` elements in each iteration.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
