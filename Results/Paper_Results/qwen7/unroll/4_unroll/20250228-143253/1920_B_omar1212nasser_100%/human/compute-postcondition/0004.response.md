Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (since the range is from 1 to `removals + 1`).

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `removals`.

4. **Adjust the necessary states**: We need to ensure that the loop can start and continue executing. This means `i` should be 1 initially, and `removals` should be a non-negative integer.

Given these points, let's construct the required state:

- `i` must be 1 to start the loop.
- `removals` must be a non-negative integer to ensure the loop can execute.

Since `pos`, `s`, `s2`, `elements`, `negatives` are not directly involved in the loop head, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `removals` must be a non-negative integer**
