### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob.

#### Function `func_1`:
- This function reads the input for multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \).
- It then reads the array \( a \) and sorts it.
- Finally, it calls `func_2` with the parameters \( k \), \( x \), and the sorted array \( a \).

#### Function `func_2`:
- This function calculates the optimal sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.
- It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in the array.
- It appends the initial value of \( s - 2 \times \text{sum of last } x \text{ elements} \) to the list `pos`.
- It iterates from 1 to \( k \) (inclusive) and updates `s` and `s2` in each iteration.
- In each iteration, it subtracts the \( i \)-th largest element from `s` and `s2`.
- If the updated index is within bounds, it adds the \( (negatives + i) \)-th largest element to `s2`.
- It appends the value of \( s - 2 \times s2 \) to the list `pos`.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

To verify the correctness, let's consider the example provided in the original assessment:

#### Example:
- Input:
  ```
  3 1 1
  -1 1 -1
  ```

- According to the problem:
  - Alice can remove at most 1 element.
  - Bob can multiply at most 1 element by -1.

- Optimal Strategy:
  - Alice removes the element `-1`.
  - Bob multiplies the remaining `-1` by -1, resulting in `1`.

- Expected Output:
  - The final sum should be `1`.

Now, let's see how the program handles this scenario:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The array `[-1, 1, -1]` is sorted to `[-1, -1, 1]`.
2. **Initial Sum Calculation**:
   - Initial sum `s = -1 + (-1) + 1 = -1`.
   - Sum of the last `x` (which is 1) elements `s2 = -1`.
   - Initial value `s - 2 * s2 = -1 - 2 * (-1) = 1`.
3. **Iteration**:
   - Alice removes the largest element `-1` (index 2).
   - Remaining array: `[-1, -1]`.
   - New sum `s = -1 + (-1) = -2`.
   - New `s2 = -1` (since we only have one element left).
   - New value `s - 2 * s2 = -2 - 2 * (-1) = 0`.

The program correctly identifies that the optimal move for Alice is to remove the largest negative element, and Bob's best response is to multiply the remaining negative element by -1. The program outputs `1` for this test case, which matches the expected output.

Given this analysis, the program correctly handles the optimal strategies for both players in the given example and other similar scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the optimal strategies for both Alice and Bob, as demonstrated by the example and the logic in the code.
