### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `x`, and the list of integers `a`.
   - It sorts the list `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)`.
   - The function prints the result of `func_2` for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2()`**:
   - This function aims to calculate the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves.
   - It initializes `s` as the sum of all elements in `elements`.
   - It iterates through possible removals by Alice and calculates `s2` as the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements.
   - It computes `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration and stores these values in the list `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`.

3. **Optimality Consideration**:
   - Alice's goal is to maximize the sum, so she should remove the smallest elements.
   - Bob's goal is to minimize the sum, so he should multiply the largest remaining elements by -1.
   - The logic in `func_2` considers both scenarios:
     - Removing elements and calculating the new sum without those elements.
     - Multiplying some of the remaining elements by -1 and calculating the new sum.
   - The function correctly handles the constraints and ensures that the optimal strategy is applied.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, Alice removes all elements, resulting in a sum of 0.
   - If `x` is equal to `n`, Bob can negate all remaining elements, effectively minimizing the sum.
   - The function handles these edge cases appropriately by considering all possible removals and negations.

### Conclusion:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the optimal sum of the array after Alice and Bob make their moves. Both functions work together to ensure that the solution meets the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
