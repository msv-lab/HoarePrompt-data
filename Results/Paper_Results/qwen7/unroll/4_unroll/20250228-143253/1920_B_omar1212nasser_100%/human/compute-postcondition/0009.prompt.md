You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: removals is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, negatives is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and elements is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
        
    #State: Output State: `pos` is a list containing the values calculated by the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the `elements` list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements`. `removals` is the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, and `negatives` is the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1.
    return max(pos)
    #The program returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains values calculated by the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the `elements` list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts three parameters: `removals`, `negatives`, and `elements`. `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, and `elements` is a list of integers where each element is between 1 and 1000 inclusive. After processing, the function returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains values calculated by the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the `elements` list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements`.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the maximum value among the list `pos`, which contains values calculated by the formula `s - 2 * s2` for each iteration of the loop, where `s` is the sum of all elements in the `elements` list and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives + i` elements of `elements`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
