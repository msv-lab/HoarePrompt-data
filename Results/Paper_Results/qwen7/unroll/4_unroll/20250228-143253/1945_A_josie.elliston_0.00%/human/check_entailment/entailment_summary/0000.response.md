Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze how the functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the minimum number of tents required for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - It uses the formula `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)` to determine the number of tents needed.
   - It also includes a condition to check if the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3. If the remainder when `extroverts` is divided by 3 is not zero, and this remainder plus the number of universals is less than 3, it returns `None`. This condition ensures that there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function calls `func_1` with `extroverts` and `universals` as arguments.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, `func_2` returns `-1`, indicating that it's impossible to accommodate all participants.
   - If `func_1` returns a non-`None` value, `func_2` adds the number of `introverts` to the result from `func_1`.

Given the problem statement and the example test cases, let's verify if these functions correctly calculate the minimum number of tents required.

- For the first test case `(1, 2, 3)`, `func_1(2, 3)` should return `2` because `(2 + 3) / 3 = 1.666...` and `ceil(1.666...) = 2`. Adding the `introvert`, the total is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- For the second test case `(1, 4, 1)`, `func_1(4, 1)` should return `2` because `(4 + 1) / 3 = 1.666...` and `ceil(1.666...) = 2`. However, since `4 % 3 = 1` and `1 + 1 < 3`, it returns `None`, leading to `-1` in `func_2`.
- For the third test case `(1, 4, 2)`, `func_1(4, 2)` should return `2` because `(4 + 2) / 3 = 2`. Adding the `introvert`, the total is `1 + 2 = 3`.

Based on the logic and the provided test cases, the functions seem to correctly implement the solution.

Correctness: **True**
