### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
   - Introverts must have a tent alone.
   - Extroverts prefer to share a tent with two others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts.
   - If not, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the pairing of extroverts and universals.
   - However, there is a potential issue in the logic of `func_1`. Specifically, when `extroverts % 3 != 0`, the check `if (extroverts % 3 + universals < 3)` is incorrect. This check should ensure that there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts such that the total number of people in the tent is 3. Instead, it should check if there are enough universals to make up the difference to the next multiple of 3.

5. **Testing the Functions:**
   - Let's consider the test case `(1, 4, 1)`:
     - `extroverts % 3 == 1` and `universals == 1`.
     - The check `if (1 + 1 < 3)` evaluates to `True`, which incorrectly suggests that it's possible to pair the extroverts and universals.
     - However, since there is only 1 universal, it's impossible to pair the 1 extrovert with another extrovert and a universal to form a group of 3. Therefore, the function should return `None` but instead returns a value, leading to an incorrect result.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The original assessment is partially correct in its understanding of the problem and the logic of `func_2`, but it is incorrect in its analysis of `func_1`. The check in `func_1` is flawed, leading to incorrect results in certain scenarios.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
