### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the minimum number of tents required to accommodate participants based on their preferences.
   - Introverts must have a tent alone.
   - Extroverts prefer to share a tent with two others.
   - Universals can share a tent with anyone.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it checks if there are enough universals to pair with the remaining extroverts.
   - If not, it returns `None` indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - Otherwise, it returns the number of tents needed using `ceil((extroverts + universals) / 3)`.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function calculates the total number of tents required.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the number of tents needed for extroverts and universals.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, it means it's impossible to accommodate everyone, so it returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of tents needed for introverts (`introverts`) to the result from `func_1`.

4. **Checking the Implementation:**
   - The logic in `func_1` correctly handles the pairing of extroverts and universals.
   - However, there is a flaw in the logic when `extroverts % 3 == 0` and there are no universals available. In such cases, `func_1` should still return the correct number of tents, but it currently returns `None` because the condition `extroverts % 3 + universals < 3` is not met.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly uses the result from `func_1` and adds the necessary tents for introverts.
   - The function handles the edge case where it's impossible to accommodate everyone by returning `-1`.

5. **Testing the Functions:**
   - The example test cases provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the functions.
   - For instance:
     - In the first test case (1 introvert, 2 extroverts, 3 universals), 1 tent for the introvert, 1 tent for 2 extroverts and 1 universal, and 1 tent for 2 universals, totaling 3 tents.
     - In the second test case (1 introvert, 4 extroverts, 1 universal), it's impossible to pair all extroverts, so it returns `-1`.
   - However, consider the case where there are 3 extroverts and no universals. According to the problem, we should be able to pair all 3 extroverts into one tent, but `func_1` would return `None` because `3 % 3 + 0 < 3` is false. This is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical flaw in `func_1` when there are no universals available and `extroverts % 3 == 0`. It incorrectly returns `None` instead of the correct number of tents. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of tents needed in all cases.

**Correctness:** False

### Final:
Final: **False**
