Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\) where \(c_i\) is chosen from the \(m\) integers \(b_i\).
2. The annotated program correctly sorts the arrays \(a\) and \(b\) and then tries to maximize the differences by comparing the smallest elements of \(a\) with the largest elements of \(b\).
3. The logic inside the loop checks whether swapping the current element in \(a\) with the corresponding element in \(b\) (from the end of \(b\)) increases the total difference. If it does, it updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
4. After the loop, it appends the remaining differences based on the value of `temp`. If `temp` is not `-1`, it means a swap was made, and the remaining differences are calculated using the elements from the end of \(b\).
5. Finally, it prints the sum of these differences, which should give the maximum possible difference \(D\).

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
