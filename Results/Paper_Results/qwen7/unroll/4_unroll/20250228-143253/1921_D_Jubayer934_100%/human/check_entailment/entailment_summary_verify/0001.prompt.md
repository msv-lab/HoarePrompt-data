You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Petya has an array a_i of n integers. His brother Vasya became envious and
decided to make his own array of n integers.

To do this, he found m integers b_i (m\ge n ), and now he wants to choose some
n integers of them and arrange them in a certain order to obtain an array c_i
of length n .

To avoid being similar to his brother, Vasya wants to make his array as
different as possible from Petya's array. Specifically, he wants the total
difference D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i| to be as large as possible.

Help Vasya find the maximum difference D he can obtain.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 100 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by a
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n\le m\le
2 \cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_i (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ).
The third line of each test case contains m integers b_i (1\le b_i\le 10^9 ).

It is guaranteed that in a test, the sum of m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum total difference D
that can be obtained.

Note

In the first example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (1, 5, 7, 2) .
Then the total difference will be D = |6-1|+|1-5|+|2-7|+|4-2| = 5+4+5+2 = 16 .

In the second example, all the integers available to Vasya are equal to 1, so
he can only create the array (1, 1, 1) , for which the difference D = 0 .

In the third example, Vasya can, for example, create the array (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
. Then the total difference will be D = |1-5|+|2-4|+|3-3|+|4-2|+|5-1| =
4+2+0+2+4 = 12 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        temp = -1
        ans = []
        a = sorted(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        b = sorted(map(int, input().split()), reverse=True)[:m]
        for i in range(n):
            if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i]):
                temp = i
                break
            ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[i]))
        if temp != -1:
            for i in range(temp, n):
                ans.append(abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]))
        print(sum(ans))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. For each test case, it sorts the lists a and b, then calculates the sum of absolute differences between the first n smallest elements of list a and the first m largest elements of list b. If a certain condition is met during the calculation, it adjusts the remaining differences using elements from the end of list b. The function outputs the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `temp` is initialized to `-1` to track if a swap is needed.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list to store the differences.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each element in `a`:
     - It compares the current element of `a` with the corresponding element in `b` (after reversing `b`).
     - If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the last element of the remaining part of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the current element of `b`, it updates `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it appends the absolute difference to `ans`.

5. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means a swap was needed, and the program adjusts the differences starting from index `temp` using the last elements of the remaining part of `b`.

6. **Calculating and Printing Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Sorting Arrays:** Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is correct because we want to maximize the differences.
- **Main Logic:** The logic of comparing the current element of `a` with both the corresponding element in `b` and the last element of the remaining part of `b` is correct. This ensures that we are considering the maximum possible difference for each element.
- **Adjusting Differences:** The adjustment logic is also correct. By swapping the elements when necessary, we ensure that the differences are maximized.
- **Summing Differences:** Summing the differences and printing the result is correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\).

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
