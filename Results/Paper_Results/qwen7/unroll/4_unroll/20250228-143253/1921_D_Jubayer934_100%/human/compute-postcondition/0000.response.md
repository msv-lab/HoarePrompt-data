Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the input value used in the `range` function, which is `int(input())`.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments:**
   - Since the loop will execute based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input value is valid for the loop to run.
   - The input value should be a positive integer (as per the problem statement).

3. **Consider the Constraints:**
   - The problem specifies that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - This means the input value must be within this range.

4. **Formulate the State Adjustment:**
   - We need to ensure that the input value is within the specified range for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state adjustments required are:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
