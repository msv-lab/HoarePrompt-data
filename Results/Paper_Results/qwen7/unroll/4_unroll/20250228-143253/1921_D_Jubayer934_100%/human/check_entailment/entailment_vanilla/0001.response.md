Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - `a` is sorted in ascending order.
   - `b` is sorted in descending order.

3. **Initialization:**
   - `temp` is initialized to `-1` to track if a swap is needed.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list to store the differences.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - For each element in `a`:
     - It compares the current element of `a` with the corresponding element in `b` (after reversing `b`).
     - If the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the last element of the remaining part of `b` is greater than the absolute difference between `a[i]` and the current element of `b`, it updates `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
     - Otherwise, it appends the absolute difference to `ans`.

5. **Adjusting Differences:**
   - If `temp` is not `-1`, it means a swap was needed, and the program adjusts the differences starting from index `temp` using the last elements of the remaining part of `b`.

6. **Calculating and Printing Result:**
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis

- **Sorting Arrays:** Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is correct because we want to maximize the differences.
- **Main Logic:** The logic of comparing the current element of `a` with both the corresponding element in `b` and the last element of the remaining part of `b` is correct. This ensures that we are considering the maximum possible difference for each element.
- **Adjusting Differences:** The adjustment logic is also correct. By swapping the elements when necessary, we ensure that the differences are maximized.
- **Summing Differences:** Summing the differences and printing the result is correct.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to maximize the total difference \(D\).

### Conclusion

Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
