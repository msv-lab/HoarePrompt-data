Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers t, n, m, a_i, and b_i. It validates that t is a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, and for each test case, n and m are positive integers with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5, and the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 2 × 10^5. Additionally, a_i and b_i are integers within the range 1 to 10^9. The function returns results based on these inputs without specifying the exact nature of the return values, focusing instead on the validation and processing of the input parameters.**
