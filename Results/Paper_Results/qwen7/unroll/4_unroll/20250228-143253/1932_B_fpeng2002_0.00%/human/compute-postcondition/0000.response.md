Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `num_tests` ≤ 1000.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. The initial conditions for `t` and the structure of the test cases remain unchanged, but since no further operations are performed on `t`, its state remains the same. The value of `num_tests` is now an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.
