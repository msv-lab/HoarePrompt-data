Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter t, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three positive integers n, k, and x, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. It also ensures that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, 1 ≤ x, k ≤ n, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 1000 for each element in the list. The sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5. The function processes each test case and returns results based on the given inputs.**

This means the function handles multiple test cases, each involving specific parameters and a list of integers, and processes them according to the defined constraints.
