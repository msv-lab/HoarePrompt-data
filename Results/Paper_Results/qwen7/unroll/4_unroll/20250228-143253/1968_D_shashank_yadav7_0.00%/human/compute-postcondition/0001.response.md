Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for i in range(t)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `t`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of `i`**: Typically, the loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `i` should be 0.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < t`. Since `i` starts at 0, the loop will execute as long as `t > 0`.

4. **Adjust the State**: Given the initial state where `t` is an input integer, we need to ensure that the loop can execute. This means `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `t` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0).

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
