Reasoning:
1. The provided program correctly reads the input values for each test case.
2. It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
3. It initializes the initial scores for Bodya (`sp`) and Sasha (`bp`).
4. It then iterates through up to `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players.
5. In each iteration, it updates the scores by considering the maximum possible score for each player based on their current position and the remaining turns.
6. After the loop, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result.

Given the execution summary and the detailed steps in the code, the program seems to follow the rules specified in the problem statement accurately. There are no apparent logical errors or discrepancies between the problem description and the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
