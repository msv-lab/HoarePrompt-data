Reasoning:
1. The problem requires dividing numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value in any of the 31 least significant bits.
2. The program uses a bitwise XOR operation with `2^31 - 1` (which is `111...111` in binary, 31 ones) to flip all bits of the number. This ensures that if two numbers have matching bits in any position, their XOR result will have a `0` at that position.
3. The program uses a dictionary to track the occurrence of the flipped numbers. If a number's flipped version is already in the dictionary, it means a group can be shared; otherwise, a new group is needed.
4. The logic of using XOR with `2^31 - 1` to ensure no two numbers in the same group have matching bits is sound and correctly implemented.
5. The program correctly counts the minimum number of groups required for each test case by incrementing the `ans` variable whenever a new group is needed.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
