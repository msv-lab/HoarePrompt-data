Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `q` and `t`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**: 
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` is an integer input by the user.
   - The value of `t` is between 1 and 500 (inclusive).
3. **Check the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `q < t`. Therefore, the loop will run from `q = 0` to `q = t-1`.

Given these points, we need to ensure that the loop can execute by adjusting the state of the variable `t`. The variable `q` will be initialized to 0 when the loop starts.

So, the state that needs to be adjusted is `t`, ensuring it is within the valid range of 1 to 500.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive)**
