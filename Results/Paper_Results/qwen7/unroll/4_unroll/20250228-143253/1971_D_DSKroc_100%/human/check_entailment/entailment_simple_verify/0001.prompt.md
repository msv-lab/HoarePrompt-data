You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 500.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each string `s` provided by the user, if the string is non-decreasing, the output is `count + 1`, otherwise, it is `count`. The variable `count` and `flag` are reset for each iteration of the outer loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of cuts needed.
   - `flag` is initialized to 0. This flag will help determine if the string is already sorted.

3. **Loop Through the String**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` from the first character to the second last character.
   - For each pair of consecutive characters, it checks if they are different (`int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`). If they are different, it increments `count`.
   - It also sets `flag` to 1 if any character is less than the next character (`int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`).

4. **Output**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is 0, it means the string is already sorted, and the number of cuts needed is `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the number of cuts needed is `count`.

### Issues in the Program

1. **Handling Sorted Strings**:
   - The program correctly identifies if the string is already sorted by setting `flag` to 1 when it encounters a character that is less than the next character. However, this check is not sufficient to determine if the string is sorted. For example, the string "101" would incorrectly set `flag` to 1 even though it is not sorted.

2. **Counting Cuts**:
   - The program counts the number of transitions (changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0). This is almost correct but needs adjustment. The correct approach should be to count the number of transitions plus one additional cut if the string is not already sorted.

### Corrected Program

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        
        # Check if the string is already sorted
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) > int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
                break
        
        # Count the number of transitions
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
        
        # Output the result
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)

func()
```

### Explanation of the Corrected Program

1. **Check if the String is Already Sorted**:
   - We iterate through the string and check if any character is greater than the next character. If we find such a pair, we set `flag` to 1 and break out of the loop.

2. **Count Transitions**:
   - We iterate through the string again and count the number of transitions (changes from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0).

3. **Output the Result**:
   - If the string is already sorted (`flag == 0`), we print `count + 1`.
   - Otherwise, we print `count`.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis and the corrected program, the original program was incorrect due to the incomplete check for sorted strings. The corrected program addresses this issue and should work correctly.

**Correctness: **True**
