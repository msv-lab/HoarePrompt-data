### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it meets the problem requirements.

1. **Initialization and Query Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The `func_1` function is used to send a query to the judge and receive the result.
   - This function correctly formats and sends the query and reads the response, which is expected for the problem.

2. **Main Function (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` aims to find the indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized.
   - The logic in `func_2` is as follows:
     1. Initialize `max_item_idx` to 0.
     2. Iterate through indices from 1 to `n-1` to find an index `max_item_idx` for which `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_{max_item_idx}) < (p_i | p_i)` for some `i`. If no such index is found, `max_item_idx` remains 0.
     3. Iterate through all indices from 0 to `n-1` to find an index `pair_idx` such that:
        - `(p_{max_item_idx} | p_{pair_idx}) < (p_{max_item_idx} | p_i)` or
        - If the above condition is not met, `(p_{pair_idx} | p_{pair_idx}) > (p_i | p_i)`.

3. **Analysis of the Logic**:
   - The logic in `func_2` seems to be flawed. Specifically, the approach to finding the maximum XOR is not optimal.
   - The current approach does not guarantee that the final pair `(max_item_idx, pair_idx)` will have the maximum possible XOR value. It only ensures that the selected indices satisfy certain conditions but does not necessarily maximize the XOR.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - A more effective strategy would involve leveraging the properties of XOR and OR operations to directly identify the indices with the highest possible XOR.
   - One common approach is to use a divide-and-conquer strategy or bit manipulation techniques to identify the indices with the highest XOR value efficiently.

Given the current implementation, the logic does not guarantee that the output will always be the pair with the maximum XOR value. Therefore, the provided code does not fully meet the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly solve the problem as described. Hence, the correctness is **False**.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
