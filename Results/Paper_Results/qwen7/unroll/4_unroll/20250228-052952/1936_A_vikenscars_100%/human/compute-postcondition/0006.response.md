Output State: **pair_idx is equal to the index `i` that makes `ans1` equal to '<' or, if no such `i` exists, it remains equal to `max_item_idx`.**

This means that after the loop finishes executing all its iterations, `pair_idx` will hold the value of `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, pair_idx, max_item_idx, i)` returns '<', if such an `i` exists. If no such `i` exists, `pair_idx` will remain unchanged and will still be equal to `max_item_idx`.
