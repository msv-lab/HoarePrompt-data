Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates through each test case, reading the board dimensions and chip positions.
2. **Initial Comparison**: The function correctly identifies when Alice's chip (`x_a`) is strictly above Bob's chip (`x_b`). In such cases, it prints 'Draw', which aligns with the problem statement since Alice cannot reach Bob's row and Bob cannot reach Alice's row.
3. **Range Calculation and Check**:
   - When `x_a` is not greater than `x_b`, the function calculates a range based on the absolute difference between `x_a` and `x_b`.
   - It then checks if Bob's chip (`y_b`) or Alice's chip (`y_d`) falls within this calculated range.
   - The logic for determining whether Alice or Bob can win is based on whether Bob's or Alice's chip can be moved into the range where the opponent's chip is located.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles edge cases where the calculated range might extend beyond the board boundaries by using `max` and `min` functions to clamp the values.
   - The logic for checking if the opponent's chip is within the calculated range is sound and correctly implemented.

Given the problem constraints and the provided execution summary, the function appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
