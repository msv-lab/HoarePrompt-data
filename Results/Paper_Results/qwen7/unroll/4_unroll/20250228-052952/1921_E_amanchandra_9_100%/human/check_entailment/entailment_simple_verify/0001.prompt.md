You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob are playing a game on a checkered board. The board has h rows,
numbered from top to bottom, and w columns, numbered from left to right. Both
players have a chip each. Initially, Alice's chip is located at the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) (row x_a , column y_a ), and Bob's chip is located at
(x_b, y_b) . It is guaranteed that the initial positions of the chips do not
coincide. Players take turns making moves, with Alice starting.

On her turn, Alice can move her chip one cell down or one cell down-right or
down-left (diagonally). Bob, on the other hand, moves his chip one cell up,
up-right, or up-left. It is not allowed to make moves that go beyond the board
boundaries.

More formally, if at the beginning of Alice's turn she is in the cell with
coordinates (x_a, y_a) , then she can move her chip to one of the cells (x_a +
1, y_a) , (x_a + 1, y_a - 1) , or (x_a + 1, y_a + 1) . Bob, on his turn, from
the cell (x_b, y_b) can move to (x_b - 1, y_b) , (x_b - 1, y_b - 1) , or (x_b
- 1, y_b + 1) . The new chip coordinates (x', y') must satisfy the conditions
1 \le x' \le h and 1 \le y' \le w .

Example game state. Alice plays with the white chip, Bob with the black one.
Arrows indicate possible moves.

A player immediately wins if they place their chip in a cell occupied by the
other player's chip. If either player cannot make a move (Alice—if she is in
the last row, i.e. x_a = h , Bob—if he is in the first row, i.e. x_b = 1 ),
the game immediately ends in a draw.

What will be the outcome of the game if both opponents play optimally?

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. This is followed by
the description of the test cases.

Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h , w , x_a ,
y_a , x_b , y_b (1 \le x_a, x_b \le h \le 10^6 , 1 \le y_a, y_b \le w \le 10^9
) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's
chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a \ne x_b or y_a \ne y_b .

It is guaranteed that the sum of h over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, output "Alice" if Alice wins, "Bob" if Bob wins, and
"Draw" if neither player can secure a victory. You can output each letter in
any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "bOb", "bob",
"Bob", and "BOB" will be accepted as Bob's victory.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initial Setup:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - It correctly maps the input values for each test case into variables `r`, `w`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` representing the height, width, Alice's position, Bob's position, and the board dimensions.

2. **Base Case Check:**
   - The program checks if Alice's row (`a`) is greater than Bob's row (`c`). If true, it prints 'Draw'. This is correct because if Alice is already in a higher row than Bob, neither can capture the other since Alice can only move down and Bob can only move up.

3. **Relative Position Calculation:**
   - The program calculates the absolute difference between Alice's row (`a`) and Bob's row (`c`) and checks if this difference is odd or even.
   - If the difference is odd, it calculates the range of possible moves for Alice (`l` and `r`) and checks if Bob's column (`b`) falls within this range.
   - If the difference is even, it calculates the range of possible moves for Bob (`l` and `r`) and checks if Alice's column (`a`) falls within this range.

4. **Winning Conditions:**
   - If the calculated ranges include Bob's or Alice's current column, the program determines a winner based on the parity of the difference between rows.
   - The logic seems to be flawed here. Specifically, the condition `abs(l - b) <= x + 1 and abs(r - b) <= x + 1` and `abs(l - d) <= x and abs(r - d) <= x` should be checked more carefully.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases where the board dimensions might cause the calculated ranges to be out of bounds. For example, if `l` or `r` exceeds the board width, the logic might fail.

### Conclusion:

The provided solution has logical flaws in determining the winning conditions and handling edge cases. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Correctness:
**False**
