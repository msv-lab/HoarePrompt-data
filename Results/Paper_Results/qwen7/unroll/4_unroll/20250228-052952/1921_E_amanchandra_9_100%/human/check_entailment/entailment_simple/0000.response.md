Reasoning:

1. The provided function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the board dimensions `r` (which should be `h`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).
3. The function checks if Alice's initial row position `a` is greater than Bob's initial row position `c`. If so, it immediately prints "Draw" because Alice cannot win under these conditions.
4. If `a` is not greater than `c`, it calculates the difference in row positions (`abs(a - c)`).
5. Depending on whether this difference is odd or even, it calculates the possible column positions for Alice and Bob within the bounds of the board.
6. It then checks if Alice can force a win by placing her chip in a column where Bob's chip is located, considering the constraints of the board's edges.
7. The logic for determining the winner is based on the relative positions of Alice and Bob, and whether Alice can force a win by moving into a column where Bob is located.

Given the provided examples and the logic implemented in the function, the function appears to correctly determine the outcome of the game based on the rules provided.

Correctness: **True**
