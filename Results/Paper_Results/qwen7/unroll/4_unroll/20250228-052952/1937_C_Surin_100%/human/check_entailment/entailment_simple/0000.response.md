### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) in a permutation \(p\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query compares the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case, it initializes some variables and performs a series of queries.
   - It uses a binary search-like approach to narrow down the potential candidates for the maximum XOR.
   - Specifically, it starts by comparing pairs of elements and updating `v1` and `prev` based on the responses.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The program seems to be attempting to find the maximum XOR by narrowing down the possibilities through comparisons.
   - The logic appears to be:
     - First, it compares pairs of elements to find a candidate (`v1`) that might have a high XOR.
     - Then, it refines the search by comparing further elements to confirm the candidate.
   - The final output is the pair of indices that maximize the XOR.

4. **Query Logic**:
   - The queries are structured to compare pairs of elements and update the candidate indices based on the responses.
   - The logic to update `v1` and `prev` seems to be correct for finding the maximum XOR.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the basic logic of querying and updating indices correctly.
   - It ensures that the number of queries does not exceed \(3n\), which is a requirement.

6. **Output**:
   - The final output is the pair of indices that maximize the XOR, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the maximum XOR using the allowed number of queries. The provided example also demonstrates that the program works as intended.

### Correctness:
**True**
