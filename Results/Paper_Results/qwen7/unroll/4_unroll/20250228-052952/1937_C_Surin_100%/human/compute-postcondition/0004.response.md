Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after all iterations, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after all iterations. These values are determined based on the comparisons made within the loop and the responses received from the input.

In the loop, `v1` is updated when the response to the query is '<', and `prev` is updated when the response to the query is '>'. If the response is '=', a further check is made to ensure `prev` is updated correctly. The final output is '! prev v1'.
