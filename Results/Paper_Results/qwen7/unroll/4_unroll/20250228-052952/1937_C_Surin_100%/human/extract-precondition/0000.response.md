Precondition: **None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function interacts with an external entity (the interactor) through standard input and output. The interactor provides the number of test cases and the details of each test case, including the size of the permutation and the results of the queries. The function must manage up to 3n queries for each test case and handle the responses accordingly.**
