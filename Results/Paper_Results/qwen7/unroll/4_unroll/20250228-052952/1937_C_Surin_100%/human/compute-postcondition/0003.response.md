Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after all iterations, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after all iterations. The loop constructs these values through a series of comparisons and updates based on the input received from the `input()` function.

In each iteration, the loop compares pairs of indices and updates `v1` and `prev` based on the comparison results ('<', '>', or '='). After completing all iterations, the final values of `prev` and `v1` are printed in the format `! {prev} {v1}`.
