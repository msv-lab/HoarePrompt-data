Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of inputs including a positive integer `t` (such that 1 <= t <= 1000), and for each test case, three positive integers `n`, `f`, and `k` (where 1 <= f, k <= n <= 100), and a list `a` of `n` integers (each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 100). It returns different outputs based on the given inputs.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of integers, and process them according to certain rules without needing any additional parameters passed directly to the function itself.
