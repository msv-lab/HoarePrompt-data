Output State: **`suff` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `suff[i]` is equal to the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`; `ans` is positive infinity.**

Explanation: The variable `ans` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which means it is set to positive infinity. The list `suff` remains unchanged, maintaining its original state where each element `suff[i]` is the sum of all elements in `c` from index `i` to `n-1`.
