Functionality: **The function accepts a single parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. The function returns a result based on the given conditions and inputs.**

- The function processes `t` test cases.
- For each test case, it checks the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`.
- The function does not explicitly return a value in the given snippet, so it might return a list or a dictionary containing results for each test case, or it might print the results directly.
