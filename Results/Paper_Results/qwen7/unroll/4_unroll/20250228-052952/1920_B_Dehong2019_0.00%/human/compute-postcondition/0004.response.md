Output State: t is the number of test cases, for each test case, n, k, and x are positive integers with the given constraints, and a is a list of n integers sorted in non-increasing order. After executing the loop, ans is the maximum value between ans1 and ans2, where ans1 is updated based on the first x elements and the next k elements of the list a.
