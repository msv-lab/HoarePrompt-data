Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies elements by -1 in an optimal way. Specifically, the program does not consider the optimal strategy for both players. Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Consider the following input:
```
3 1 1
-1 2 -3
```

According to the problem description, Alice can remove at most 1 element, and Bob can multiply at most 1 element by -1. The optimal strategy would be for Alice to remove the smallest negative number (-3), and for Bob to multiply the largest positive number (2) by -1. This results in the array becoming `[-1, -2]`, and the sum is `-3`.

However, the program calculates the sum without considering the optimal moves:
1. It sorts the array in descending order: `[2, -1, -3]`.
2. It calculates `ans1` as the sum of the array: `2 + (-1) + (-3) = -2`.
3. It subtracts twice the smallest element (since Bob can multiply one element by -1): `-2 - 2*(-3) = 4`.

This result is incorrect because the optimal strategy leads to a sum of `-3`, not `4`. Therefore, the program does not handle the optimal moves correctly and is thus incorrect.
