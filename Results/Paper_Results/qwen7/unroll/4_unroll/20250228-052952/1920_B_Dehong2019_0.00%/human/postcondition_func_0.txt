The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order. Then, it calculates two values, `ans1` and `ans2`, by adjusting the sum of the list based on the first `x` elements and the next `k` elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of these two values for each test case.
