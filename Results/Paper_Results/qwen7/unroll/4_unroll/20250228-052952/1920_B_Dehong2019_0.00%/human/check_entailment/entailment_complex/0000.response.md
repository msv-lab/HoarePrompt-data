Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x`, and then reads the list `a` of `n` integers.
3. The list `a` is sorted in non-increasing order.
4. The variable `ans1` is initialized with the sum of the sorted list `a`.
5. The program then iteratively reduces `ans1` by twice the value of the smallest `x` elements in the list, simulating Bob's action of multiplying `x` elements by `-1`.
6. Another variable `ans2` is initialized with the value of `ans1`.
7. The program then iteratively adds the value of the smallest `k` elements to `ans1` and subtracts twice the value of the corresponding `x` elements, simulating Alice's removal of `k` elements and Bob's subsequent action.
8. The maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2` is stored in `ans` and printed, which represents the optimal sum of the array after both players have made their moves.

Given the logic and the steps outlined, the program appears to correctly implement the described game rules and calculate the optimal sum of the array after both players have played optimally.

Correctness: **True**
