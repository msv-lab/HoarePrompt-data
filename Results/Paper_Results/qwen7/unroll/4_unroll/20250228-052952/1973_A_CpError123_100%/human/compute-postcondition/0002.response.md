Output State: The output state will consist of a series of values printed for each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even, it will print either `(a+b+c)//2` or `a+b`, whichever is smaller. If the sum is odd, it will print `-1`. The exact sequence of values depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop.
