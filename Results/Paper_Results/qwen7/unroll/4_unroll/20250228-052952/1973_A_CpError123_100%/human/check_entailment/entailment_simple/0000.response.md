Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` (which are assigned to `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` respectively).
3. It checks if the sum of `a`, `b`, and `c` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because an even sum is necessary for the scores to be achievable (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total in case of a draw).
4. If the sum is even, it calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`, which represents the total number of games played (since each game contributes 2 points in total).
5. It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
6. Finally, it prints the minimum of `x` and `y`. This is because the maximum number of draws would occur when the points from the first two players are maximally distributed through draws, i.e., each draw gives 1 point to each of the first two players.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to find the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

Correctness: **True**
