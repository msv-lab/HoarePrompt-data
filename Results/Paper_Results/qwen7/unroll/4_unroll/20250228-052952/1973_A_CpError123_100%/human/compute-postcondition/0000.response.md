Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the value of `t` after executing the code will be the integer input provided by the user, which must fall within this range. Variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` are not affected by this code snippet, so their initial conditions remain unchanged.
