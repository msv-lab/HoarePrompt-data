### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `a`, `b`, and `c` of the three players.

2. **Initial Check for Validity**:
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores `(a + b + c)` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even for the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total if it ends in a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the total score must be even for the scores to be achievable through the described game outcomes.

3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - The program calculates `x` as `(a + b + c) // 2`. This value represents half of the total points scored by all players combined.
   - It then calculates `y` as `a + b`, which represents the total points scored by the first two players.
   - Finally, it prints `min(x, y)`, which should represent the maximum possible number of draws. However, this calculation does not correctly account for the distribution of points among the players.

4. **Correct Calculation of Maximum Draws**:
   - To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
     - Each draw gives 1 point to each player, contributing 2 points in total.
     - The remaining points (after accounting for draws) must be distributed such that the scores are consistent with the given constraints.
   - The correct approach involves:
     - Calculating the maximum possible number of draws by ensuring the remaining points can be distributed between the players without violating the score constraints.
     - Specifically, the maximum number of draws \(d\) can be calculated as \(d = \min(a, b, c)\).

Let's verify the logic with the examples provided:

- **Example 1**: \(0, 0, 0\)
  - Total points: \(0 + 0 + 0 = 0\)
  - Half of total points: \(0 // 2 = 0\)
  - \(a + b = 0\)
  - \(min(0, 0) = 0\)
  - Correct output: \(0\)

- **Example 2**: \(0, 1, 1\)
  - Total points: \(0 + 1 + 1 = 2\)
  - Half of total points: \(2 // 2 = 1\)
  - \(a + b = 1\)
  - \(min(1, 1) = 1\)
  - Correct output: \(1\)

- **Example 3**: \(1, 1, 1\)
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\)
  - Half of total points: \(3 // 2 = 1\)
  - \(a + b = 2\)
  - \(min(1, 2) = 1\)
  - Incorrect output: \(-1\)

- **Example 4**: \(1, 1, 2\)
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 2 = 4\)
  - Half of total points: \(4 // 2 = 2\)
  - \(a + b = 2\)
  - \(min(2, 2) = 2\)
  - Correct output: \(2\)

- **Example 5**: \(3, 3, 3\)
  - Total points: \(3 + 3 + 3 = 9\)
  - Half of total points: \(9 // 2 = 4\)
  - \(a + b = 6\)
  - \(min(4, 6) = 4\)
  - Incorrect output: \(-1\)

- **Example 6**: \(3, 4, 5\)
  - Total points: \(3 + 4 + 5 = 12\)
  - Half of total points: \(12 // 2 = 6\)
  - \(a + b = 7\)
  - \(min(6, 7) = 6\)
  - Correct output: \(6\)

- **Example 7**: \(1, 1, 10\)
  - Total points: \(1 + 1 + 10 = 12\)
  - Half of total points: \(12 // 2 = 6\)
  - \(a + b = 2\)
  - \(min(6, 2) = 2\)
  - Correct output: \(2\)

The program fails to correctly calculate the maximum number of draws in some cases. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that the remaining points must be distributed between the players in a way that respects the score constraints.

### Conclusion:

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Correctness:

**False**

Final: **False**
