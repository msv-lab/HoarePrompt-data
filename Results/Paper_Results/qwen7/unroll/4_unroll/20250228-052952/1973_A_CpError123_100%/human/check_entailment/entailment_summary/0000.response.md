Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem but does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of draws. Here's why:

1. **Sum Check**: The program correctly checks if the sum of the scores \(a + b + c\) is even. If it is not, it prints \(-1\) because an odd sum cannot be achieved by the given scoring rules (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player and 0 to another, or 1 point to each player).

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The program calculates \(x = \frac{a + b + c}{2}\) and \(y = a + b\). It then prints `min(x, y)`. However, this approach is flawed:
   - \(x\) represents the total number of games played (each game contributes 2 points in total).
   - \(y\) represents the total points scored by the first two players combined.
   - The minimum of \(x\) and \(y\) does not necessarily give the maximum number of draws. For example, if \(a = 1\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 3\), the program would output 1, but the correct answer should be 2 (since the first two players could have drawn both games they played, and the third player could have won both).

3. **Handling Draw Points**: The program does not account for the fact that in a draw, both players get 1 point. Therefore, the logic to calculate the maximum number of draws needs to consider how many points were scored in draws versus wins.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
