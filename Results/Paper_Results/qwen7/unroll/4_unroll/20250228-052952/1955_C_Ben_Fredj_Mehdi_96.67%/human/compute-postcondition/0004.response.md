Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), which indicates the number of subsequent test sub-cases. For each sub-case, two positive integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^15) are provided, along with a list a of n positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), representing the durabilities of ships. The function returns different values based on the conditions specified for each sub-case.**

This functionality describes a function that iterates over multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and processes them according to given rules without accepting any direct parameters itself.
