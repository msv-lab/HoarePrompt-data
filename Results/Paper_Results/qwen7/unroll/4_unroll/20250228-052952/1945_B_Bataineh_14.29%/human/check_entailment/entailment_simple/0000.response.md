Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to verify if it correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time based on the given frequencies \(a\) and \(b\), and the visibility duration \(m\).

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases \(t\) and processes each test case individually.
2. **Frequency and Visibility Calculation**:
   - It checks if \(m < a\) or \(m < b\). If true, it prints 2, which is the minimum number of fireworks visible in the worst-case scenario.
   - Otherwise, it uses the formula \(m // a + m // b + 2\) to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

### Correctness Check:
- **Case 1: \(m < a\) or \(m < b\)**:
  - In this case, the program correctly outputs 2 because the visibility period is shorter than the interval between launches for both installations. This ensures that no more than 2 fireworks can be seen at any time.

- **Case 2: \(m \geq a\) and \(m \geq b\)**:
  - The formula \(m // a + m // b + 2\) is used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Here's why this formula works:
    - \(m // a\) gives the number of times the first installation launches within the visibility period.
    - \(m // b\) gives the number of times the second installation launches within the visibility period.
    - Adding 2 accounts for the initial fireworks launched by both installations at \(t=0\).

### Example Verification:
- **Example 1**: \(a = 6\), \(b = 7\), \(m = 4\)
  - \(m < a\) and \(m < b\), so the output should be 2.
- **Example 2**: \(a = 3\), \(b = 4\), \(m = 10\)
  - \(m \geq a\) and \(m \geq b\), so the output should be \(10 // 3 + 10 // 4 + 2 = 3 + 2 + 2 = 7\).
- **Example 3**: \(a = 7\), \(b = 8\), \(m = 56\)
  - \(m \geq a\) and \(m \geq b\), so the output should be \(56 // 7 + 56 // 8 + 2 = 8 + 7 + 2 = 17\).

Given the examples and the logic of the program, the provided solution correctly implements the required functionality.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly handles all edge cases and computes the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously based on the given parameters.

Correctness: **True**
