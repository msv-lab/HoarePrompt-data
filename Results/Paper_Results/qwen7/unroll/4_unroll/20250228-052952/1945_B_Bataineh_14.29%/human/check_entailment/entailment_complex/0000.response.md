Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Condition Check**: The program checks if `m` is less than both `a` and `b`. If this condition is true, it prints `2`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.

   - When `m < a` and `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time is `2`. This is because the next launch times for both installations will be greater than `m`, meaning only the initial launches will be visible.
   - When `m >= a` and/or `m >= b`, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` correctly calculates the maximum number of fireworks visible at the same time. The term `m // a` gives the count of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period, `m // b` gives the count for the second installation, and `+2` accounts for the initial launches from both installations.

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the expected output format.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the annotated program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
