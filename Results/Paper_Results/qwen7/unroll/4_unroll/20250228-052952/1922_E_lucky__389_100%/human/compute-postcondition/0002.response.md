Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18, and `x` is assigned the value of int(input()); `subseq_lens` is an empty list; `mx` is 0.**

Explanation: The variable `mx` is initialized to 0. The values of `t`, `x`, and `subseq_lens` remain unchanged from their initial states. The value of `x` is updated to the integer value entered by the user through `int(input())`.
