Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The condition `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1` checks if the total score is odd. However, this alone is not sufficient to determine if the scores are consistent. For instance, the scores `1, 1, 2` should be valid, but the current check would incorrectly flag it as invalid because the sum `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`, which is even.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The formula used to calculate the maximum number of draws is incorrect. The current logic subtracts the difference between the highest score and the sum of the other two scores from the total score and then divides by 2. This approach does not account for the distribution of wins and losses correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, we need to ensure the following:
- The total score must be even.
- The scores should be achievable through a combination of wins, losses, and draws.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Total score must be even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        # The maximum number of draws can be calculated as:
        # (p3 - p1) / 2 (since each draw contributes 1 point to both players)
        # We need to ensure that the remaining points (p2 - p1) can be distributed as wins and draws
        max_draws = (p3 - p1) // 2
        remaining_points = p2 - p1
        
        # Check if the remaining points can be distributed as wins and draws
        if remaining_points > max_draws * 2 or remaining_points < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

# Example usage
func()
```

This corrected program ensures that the total score is even and then calculates the maximum number of draws while checking if the remaining points can be distributed correctly among wins and draws.
