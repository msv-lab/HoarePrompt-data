You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
import sys

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)



- Annotated Code: 
import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        v = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if (v[0] + v[1] + v[2]) % 2 == 1:
            print('-1')
        else:
            result = (v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2
            print(result)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the input provided for each iteration of the loop. For each input triplet (v[0], v[1], v[2]), if the sum of the triplet is odd, "-1" will be printed; otherwise, the result calculated as \((v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2\) will be printed. This process will repeat for `t` iterations, where `t` is the initial value of the input integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of the three integers is odd. If the sum is odd, it prints \(-1\). If the sum is even, it calculates a specific value based on the integers and prints it. The function reads the number of test cases from the input, processes each test case according to the described logic, and outputs the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of draws that could have happened. Let's consider the following test case:

**Input:**
```
1
1 1 2
```

According to the problem description, the scores are \( p_1 = 1 \), \( p_2 = 1 \), and \( p_3 = 2 \). The program calculates the result using the formula:
\[ \text{result} = \frac{(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - \max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1]))}{2} \]

Substituting the values:
\[ \text{result} = \frac{(1 + 1 + 2 - \max(0, 2 - 1 - 1))}{2} = \frac{4 - 0}{2} = 2 \]

However, the correct solution involves checking the possible combinations of wins and draws. For the scores \(1, 1, 2\), the only valid combination is:
- Player 1 vs Player 2: Draw (1-1)
- Player 1 vs Player 3: Draw (1-1)
- Player 2 vs Player 3: Player 3 wins (2-0)

This results in 2 draws, which matches the expected output. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as 2, which is not the maximum number of draws possible. 

To achieve the maximum number of draws, the correct approach would involve checking all possible combinations of wins and draws and ensuring the constraints are met. The current implementation does not handle this correctly, leading to incorrect results for certain inputs.
