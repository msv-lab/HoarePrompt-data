The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three non-negative integers \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) where \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\). For each test case, it checks if the sum of \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd or \(p_3\) is greater than or equal to \(p_1 + p_2\), it outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it finds a value \(cur\) such that \(p_1 - cur \leq p_2 - (p3 - cur)\) and outputs \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) exists, it outputs \(p3\). The function returns a list of outputs, one for each test case.
