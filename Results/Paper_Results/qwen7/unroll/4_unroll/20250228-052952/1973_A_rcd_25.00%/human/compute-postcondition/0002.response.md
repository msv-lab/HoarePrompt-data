Output State: t is an input integer between 1 and 500, after executing all iterations of the loop, the output consists of t lines. Each line contains either -1 or a non-negative integer based on the conditions inside the loop. If the sum of p1, p2, and p3 is odd, the line will contain -1. Otherwise, it will contain either p1 + p2 or a value calculated from p1, p2, and p3 based on the specified conditions.
