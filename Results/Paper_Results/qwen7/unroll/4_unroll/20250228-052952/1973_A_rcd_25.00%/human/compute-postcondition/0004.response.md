Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on the conditions specified for the variables t, p_1, p_2, and p_3. For each test case, if 1 ≤ t ≤ 500 and 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30, the function processes these values and returns a corresponding output.**

Note: The actual return value or output logic based on the conditions is not specified in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the constraints and the fact that the function processes these variables according to the given ranges.
