Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases. Specifically, it fails to consider the possibility of draws and the constraints of the problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Check for Odd Sum**: The program checks if `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` and prints `-1` if true. This check is correct, but it does not cover all scenarios where the sum is even.

2. **Handling Scores**: The program assumes that `p3 >= p1 + p2` and directly prints `p1 + p2` if this condition is met. However, this assumption is too restrictive. For example, consider the input `1 1 2`. According to the problem statement, the scores can be achieved through two draws (each player gets 1 point from a draw). The current implementation does not account for this scenario.

3. **Binary Search for Draws**: The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. The program attempts to incrementally find the maximum number of draws, but it does not correctly handle the constraints and edge cases. For instance, in the input `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly outputs `2` instead of `-1`.

To correctly solve the problem, the program needs to:
- Ensure the sum of the scores is even.
- Consider all possible ways to distribute the scores among the players, including draws.
- Handle cases where the scores cannot be achieved through valid games and results.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
