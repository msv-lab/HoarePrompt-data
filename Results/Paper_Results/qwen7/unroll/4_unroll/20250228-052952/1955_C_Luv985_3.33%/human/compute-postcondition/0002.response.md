Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `T`.

2. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop `while T:` will execute as long as `T` is truthy. In Python, non-zero integers are considered truthy.

3. **Current state before the loop**: The state given is that `T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).

4. **Determine if adjustment is needed**: Since `T` is already a positive integer (and thus non-zero), it satisfies the condition `T` being truthy. Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for `T` to allow the loop to execute the first time.

5. **Conclusion**: No changes are needed to the state of `T` for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`T` is an input integer and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\)**
