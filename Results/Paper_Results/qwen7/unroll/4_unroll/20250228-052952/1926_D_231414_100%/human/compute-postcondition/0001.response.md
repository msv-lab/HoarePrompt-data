Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value \(2^{31} - 1\) to the variable `check`. Since \(2^{31} - 1 = 2147483647\), `check` is set to this specific value. The initial values of `times` and `t` remain unchanged.
