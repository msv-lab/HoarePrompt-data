Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4.**

Explanation: The code `times = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `times`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds the value specified in the initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
