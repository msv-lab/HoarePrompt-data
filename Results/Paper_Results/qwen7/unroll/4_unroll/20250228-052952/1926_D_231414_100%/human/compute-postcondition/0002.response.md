State: **`times` must be greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, check is 2147483647**.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Loop Head Variables**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `times`. The variable `t` is not directly involved in the loop head but is mentioned in the initial state.

2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `times` is greater than 0. If `times` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute at all.

3. **Adjust States**: Since the loop head involves `times`, this variable must be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute. The other variables (`t` and `check`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and thus do not need to be adjusted for the loop to start executing.

4. **Final State**: Therefore, the state must be adjusted to ensure `times` is greater than 0, while keeping `t` within its specified range and `check` as given.
