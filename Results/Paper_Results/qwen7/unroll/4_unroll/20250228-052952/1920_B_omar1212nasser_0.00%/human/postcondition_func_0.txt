The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), along with a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value. This product value is printed for each test case. The function does not return any value but updates the variable `t` (the number of test cases) and prints the computed product for each test case.
