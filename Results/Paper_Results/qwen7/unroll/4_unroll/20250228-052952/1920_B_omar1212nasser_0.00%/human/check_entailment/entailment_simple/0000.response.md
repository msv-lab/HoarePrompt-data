### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - This function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`), and for each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `x` followed by the array `a`.
   - It sorts the array `a` and then calls `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute the result.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2(removals, negatives, elements)`**:
   - This function has a conditional check that always returns `0` when `removals == 6` and `negatives == 3`.
   - Otherwise, it initializes an empty list `pos` to store potential sums.
   - It calculates the sum of the entire array `s` and the sum of the last `negatives` elements `n`.
   - It then iterates up to `removals` times, updating `s` and `n` and appending the calculated sum to `pos`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value from `pos`.

### Analysis:

- The function `func_2` is designed to handle the game logic where Alice removes elements and Bob multiplies some elements by -1.
- However, the implementation of `func_2` is flawed because it does not actually account for the optimal strategy for both players. Instead, it always returns `0` under certain conditions and does not consider the actual game dynamics.

Given the problem statement, the optimal strategy involves:
- Alice removing the smallest elements to minimize the negative impact on the sum.
- Bob multiplying the largest remaining elements by -1 to minimize the sum further.

However, the current implementation does not reflect this logic. It simply returns `0` under specific conditions without considering the actual game dynamics.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **False**
