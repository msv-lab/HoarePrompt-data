Output State: The value of `cnt` is calculated based on the given conditions for each test case. Specifically, `cnt` is incremented by 1 if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s in the input list are all odd, and then `cnt` is further incremented by half the sum of all elements in the list, rounded down. The final value of `cnt` for each test case is printed.
