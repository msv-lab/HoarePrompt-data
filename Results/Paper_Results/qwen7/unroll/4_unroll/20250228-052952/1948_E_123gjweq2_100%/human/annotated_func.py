#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, and the function `make_array` is defined elsewhere to populate the array `arr` and `cliquess` according to the specified conditions.
def func_1(n, k):
    cliques = ceil(n / k)
    arr = [0] * n
    cliquess = [0] * n
    for i in range(cliques):
        make_array(i * k, min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1), i + 1)
        
    #State: Output State: `cliques` is equal to ceil(`n` / `k`), `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 40, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 2 * n, `arr` is a list of `n` ones, `cliquess` is a list of `n` zeros.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates `cliques` times. During each iteration, the `make_array` function is called with parameters `i * k`, `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)`, and `i + 1`. This function presumably sets the elements in the `arr` list from index `i * k` to `min((i + 1) * k - 1, n - 1)` to `i + 1`. Since `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `cliques - 1`, every element in `arr` will eventually be set to some value between 1 and `cliques`, but since we are incrementing `i + 1` each time, the highest value that any element can take is `cliques`. However, because the loop ensures that each segment is filled with the same value, and considering the range of indices covered, each position in `arr` will end up being set to 1 (since the smallest possible `cliques` is 1, and the largest `i + 1` can be is `cliques`, but due to the way the ranges are defined, it will always be 1). Therefore, `arr` ends up being a list of `n` ones. The `cliquess` list remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
    print(*arr)
    #This is printed: 1 1 1 ... 1 (n times)
    print(cliques)
    #This is printed: cliques (where cliques is the ceiling of n divided by k)
    print(*cliquess)
    #This is printed: 0 0 ... 0 (where there are n zeros)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 40, and `k` is an integer between 1 and 2 * `n`. It calculates the number of cliques as the ceiling of `n` divided by `k` and initializes two lists, `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`. It then calls the `make_array` function to fill `arr` with values such that each segment of `arr` is set to the same value, resulting in `arr` being a list of `n` ones. The function prints `arr`, the calculated number of cliques, and `cliquess`. Finally, it returns `arr` and `cliquess`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: left and right are integers such that left < right and represent the range of indices in the array arr to be filled. clique is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range.
def make_array(left, right, clique):
    small_element = left + 1
    big_element = right + 1
    mid = (big_element - small_element + 1) // 2
    not_mid = right - left + 1 - mid
    for i in range(mid):
        arr[left + mid - i - 1] = small_element + i
        
        cliquess[left + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`, `arr` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left + mid - 1, left)` (inclusive), `arr[i] = small_element + (mid - 1 - i)`, and `cliquess` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1)` (inclusive), `cliquess[i] = clique`.
    for i in range(not_mid):
        arr[left + mid + i] = big_element - i
        
        cliquess[left + mid + i] = clique
        
    #State: Output State: `left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`, `arr` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left + mid - 1, right]` (inclusive), `arr[i] = big_element - (i - left - mid + 1)`, and `cliquess` is a list where for each `i` in the range `[left, left + mid - 1)` (inclusive), `cliquess[i] = clique`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `make_array` accepts parameters `left`, `right`, and `clique`. It fills an array `arr` with values from `left` to `right - 1` such that the first half of the range is filled with increasing values starting from `left + 1` and the second half is filled with decreasing values starting from `right + 1`. Additionally, it sets the corresponding entries in the `cliquess` list to the value of `clique`.
