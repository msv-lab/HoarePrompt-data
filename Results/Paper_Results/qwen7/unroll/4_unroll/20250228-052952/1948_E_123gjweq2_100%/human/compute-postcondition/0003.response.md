Output State: **`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier for the elements in the specified range, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1**.

Explanation: The variable `not_mid` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given the initial values, `mid` is calculated as `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `(right - left + 1) // 2`. Therefore, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - (right - left + 1) // 2`, which further simplifies to `right - left - mid + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
