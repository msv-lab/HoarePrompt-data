### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires assigning unique integers from 1 to \( n \) to the vertices of a graph such that the resulting graph can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques. A clique is a subset of vertices where every two distinct vertices are adjacent.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code defines a function `func_1` which takes \( n \) and \( k \) as inputs.
   - It calculates the number of cliques needed as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` with length \( n \).
   - The function calls `make_array` for each clique, setting the appropriate elements in `arr` and `cliquess`.

3. **Function `make_array` Analysis**:
   - This function fills the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` parameters.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns values to these parts.
   - The values assigned to `arr` are sequential integers starting from `small_element` to `big_element`.

4. **Output Analysis**:
   - The output for each test case includes:
     - The array `arr` filled with 1s (since the loop in `func_1` sets all elements to 1).
     - The number of cliques, which is `ceil(n / k)`.
     - The `cliquess` array, which is initialized to all zeros and not modified by the code.

5. **Correctness Check**:
   - The assignment of 1s to `arr` does not satisfy the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) for any pair of vertices \( (i, j) \).
   - The problem requires distinct integers from 1 to \( n \) to be assigned to the vertices, but the current implementation assigns the same integer (1) to all vertices.
   - The output does not meet the requirement of forming a graph that can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not assign distinct integers to the vertices and does not form a graph that can be partitioned into the minimum number of cliques.

**Correctness: False**
