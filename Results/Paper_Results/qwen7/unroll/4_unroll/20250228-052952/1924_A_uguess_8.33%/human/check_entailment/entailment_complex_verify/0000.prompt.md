You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        cnt = 0
        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:

            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.

            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After executing the loop, the value of `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, and for each input, either "YES" or "NO" followed by a string `ans` will be printed. The string `ans` is constructed based on the conditions within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). It then checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) unique substrings of length \( k \). If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a constructed string based on the remaining characters needed to meet the condition. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for checking if all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of `s`. 

The program attempts to use a bitmask to track the presence of each character in the current substring of `s`, but it does not ensure that all combinations of length `n` are checked. Specifically, the program increments the count (`cnt`) whenever all `k` characters are found in the current substring, but it does not guarantee that all possible subsequences of length `n` are covered.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3 3 10
  aabbccabab
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
aa
```

This is incorrect because all possible strings of length 3 that can be formed using the first 3 lowercase English alphabets ('a', 'b', 'c') do occur as subsequences in the string "aabbccabab". For example, "abc", "acb", "bac", etc., are all present.

The program fails to correctly handle the generation and checking of all possible subsequences of length `n`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
