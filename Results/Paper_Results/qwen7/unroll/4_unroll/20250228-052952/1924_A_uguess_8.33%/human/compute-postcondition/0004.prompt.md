You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s is a string of length m comprising only the first k lowercase English alphabets.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: After executing the loop, the value of `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, and for each input, either "YES" or "NO" followed by a string `ans` will be printed. The string `ans` is constructed based on the conditions within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, k, m, and s, where t is an integer between 1 and 100000, n and k are integers between 1 and 26, m is an integer between 1 and 1000, and s is a string of length m comprising the first k lowercase English alphabets. For each test case, the function determines and returns something based on these inputs, though the specific output is not detailed here.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
