You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two integers n and k along with a string s .

Your task is to check whether all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s . If the answer is NO, you also need to print a string of length n that can
be formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur
as a subsequence of s .

If there are multiple answers, you may print any of them.

Note: A string a is called a subsequence of another string b if a can be
obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) characters from b without changing
the order of the remaining characters.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t \, (1 \le t \le 10^5) ,
the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n \, (1 \le n \le 26), \:
k \, (1 \le k \le 26), \: m \, (1 \le m \le 1000) , where n and k are the same
as described in the input and m is the length of the string s .

The second line of each test case contains a single string s of length m ,
comprising only of the first k lowercase English alphabets.

It is guaranteed that the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does
not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if all possible strings of length n that can be
formed using the first k lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of
s , else print NO.

If your answer is NO, print a string of length n that can be formed using the
first k lowercase English alphabets which does not occur as a subsequence of s
in the next line.

You may print each letter of YES or NO in any case (for example, YES, yES, YeS
will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input

    3
    
    2 2 4
    
    abba
    
    2 2 3
    
    abb
    
    3 3 10
    
    aabbccabab

Output

    YES
    NO
    aa
    NO
    ccc
    
Note

For the first test case, all possible strings (aa, ab, ba, bb) of length 2
that can be formed using the first 2 English alphabets occur as a subsequence
of abba.

For the second test case, the string aa is not a subsequence of abb.

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):

        cur = 0
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0

            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5.

    #State: After executing the loop, the value of `t` will be decremented by 1 for each iteration, and for each input, either "YES" or "NO" followed by a string `ans` will be printed. The string `ans` is constructed based on the conditions within the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers \( t \), \( n \), \( k \), and \( m \), and a string \( s \). It then checks if the string \( s \) contains at least \( n \) unique substrings of length \( k \). If so, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO" followed by a constructed string based on the remaining characters needed to meet the condition. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, and `m` followed by the string `s`.

2. **Tracking Subsequences:**
   - The program uses a bitmask (`cur`) to track which of the first `k` lowercase English alphabets have been seen in the string `s` so far.
   - It iterates through each character in `s` and updates the bitmask accordingly.
   - If the bitmask `cur` equals `(1 << k) - 1`, it means all `k` alphabets have been seen at least once in the current substring of `s`.

3. **Counting Valid Subsequences:**
   - The variable `cnt` keeps track of how many times all `k` alphabets have been seen as a subsequence in `s`.
   - If `cnt` is greater than or equal to `n`, it prints "YES" because all possible strings of length `n` using the first `k` alphabets can be found as subsequences in `s`.

4. **Handling Invalid Cases:**
   - If `cnt` is less than `n`, it prints "NO".
   - It then constructs a string `ans` that represents a sequence of characters which cannot form a valid subsequence of `s`. This is done by finding the lexicographically smallest missing character and filling the rest with 'a'.

### Issues Identified:

1. **Bitmask Usage:**
   - The bitmask logic is correct in tracking which characters have been seen.
   - However, the way the bitmask is reset and used might not be optimal for large values of `n` and `k`.

2. **Constructing the Result String:**
   - The construction of the result string `ans` is flawed. It does not ensure that the constructed string is the lexicographically smallest one that cannot be a subsequence of `s`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle edge cases well, such as when `s` is very short but still contains all necessary characters for forming valid subsequences.

### Correctness Evaluation:

Given the issues identified, particularly the flawed construction of the result string, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly construct the lexicographically smallest string that cannot be a subsequence of `s` when `cnt < n`. Therefore, the solution is not entirely correct.
