State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^5, `i` is 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration.
2. The loop runs for `t` times, where `t` is the number of iterations.
3. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer.
4. The initial value of `i` is set to 0 before the loop starts.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be a positive integer within the given range, and `i` should start at 0.
