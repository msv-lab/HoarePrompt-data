Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list containing the integers inputted for `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `a`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are no longer directly accessible as separate variables but are now stored in the list `a` as `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[3]` respectively. The constraints on `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` remain valid, but now they are encapsulated within the list `a`.
