Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `x` is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5); `y` is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x; `a` is a list where each element is (num - 1) for each num in the original list `a`.**

Explanation: The code replaces each element `num` in the list `a` with `(num - 1)`. Since `a` originally contained the integers `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, after executing the code, `a` will contain `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `x`, `y`) remain unchanged according to their initial conditions.
