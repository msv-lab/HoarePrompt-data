### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to divide the given integers into the minimum number of groups such that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st bit.
   - The key observation is that we can use the XOR operation with \(1 \ll 31 - 1\) (which is \(2^{31} - 1\)) to transform each number into a unique value that only depends on its 31 least significant bits. This transformation ensures that if two numbers have different bits in their 31 least significant bits, their transformed values will also be different.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   - The code defines a function `func_1` which takes the number of elements `n` and a list of integers `a`.
   - It initializes `res` to 0, which will store the result (minimum number of groups).
   - A dictionary `count` is used to keep track of the occurrences of transformed values.
   - For each number `num` in the list `a`, it checks if `num` is already in `count`. If not, it transforms `num` using `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` and increments the count for this transformed value, incrementing `res` by 1.
   - If `num` is already in `count`, it decrements the count for `num`.

3. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The transformation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` effectively isolates the 31 least significant bits of `num` and maps them to a unique value.
   - If two numbers have different bits in their 31 least significant bits, their transformed values will be different, ensuring they end up in different groups.
   - The logic correctly counts the number of unique transformed values, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles all edge cases, including when the same number appears multiple times, as it correctly increments and decrements the count.

### Conclusion:
The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
