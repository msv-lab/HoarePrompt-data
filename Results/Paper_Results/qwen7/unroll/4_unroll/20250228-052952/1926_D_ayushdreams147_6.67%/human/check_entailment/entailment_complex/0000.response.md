Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires dividing numbers into groups such that no two numbers in the same group share the same bit value at any position from the 1st to the 31st bit. This means that for any two numbers \(x\) and \(y\) in the same group, \(x_2(i) \neq y_2(i)\) for all \(1 \leq i < 32\).

2. **Key Insight**: A number's bits from the 1st to the 31st can be mapped to a 31-bit binary number. Given that there are \(2^{31}\) possible unique 31-bit binary numbers, the maximum number of elements that can be in a single group without violating the condition is \(2^{31}\).

3. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `a` and the length `n`.
   - It uses a bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1` to transform each number. This operation essentially flips all the bits of the number.
   - The transformed numbers are used to create a count dictionary, where the keys are the transformed numbers and the values are their counts.
   - The function increments `res` each time a new key is added to the dictionary, indicating a new unique transformed number.
   - The function then decrements the count for each number that appears more than once.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The function correctly identifies the number of unique transformed numbers, which corresponds to the minimum number of groups needed because each unique transformed number can represent a separate group.
   - The bitwise operation ensures that if two numbers have different bits in any position, their transformed versions will also differ in some bit position, thus satisfying the condition.
   - The logic of counting unique transformed numbers and handling duplicates correctly reflects the requirement of the problem.

Given the analysis, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
