Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in `func_1` is flawed because it attempts to use a bitmask to group numbers based on their 31 least significant bits, but it does not properly ensure that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st position.

To correctly solve this problem, you should use a bitmask approach where each number is mapped to a unique bitmask value based on its 31 least significant bits. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(n, a))

def func_1(n, a):
    bit_mask_map = {}
    max_groups = 0
    for num in a:
        # Create a bitmask for the 31 least significant bits
        bitmask = num & ((1 << 31) - 1)
        # Find the group this number belongs to
        group = bit_mask_map.get(bitmask, -1)
        if group == -1:
            # If this bitmask hasn't been seen before, create a new group
            bit_mask_map[bitmask] = max_groups
            max_groups += 1
        else:
            # Otherwise, just assign to the existing group
            pass
    return max_groups
```

This version correctly maps each number to a group based on its 31 least significant bits, ensuring that no two numbers in the same group have matching bits from the 1st to the 31st position.
