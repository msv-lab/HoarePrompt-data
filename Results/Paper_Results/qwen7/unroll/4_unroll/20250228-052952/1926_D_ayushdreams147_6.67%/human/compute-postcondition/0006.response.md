Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of integers, and `a`, a list of `n` non-negative integers where each integer is less than \(2^{31}\). The function returns the number of unique integers in the list `a` after applying the bitwise operation `num ^ (1 << 31) - 1`, and it also returns a dictionary `count` where the keys are the results of the bitwise operation on each number in `a`, and the values are the counts of these keys, with the count decremented for numbers that appear more than once in the list.**
