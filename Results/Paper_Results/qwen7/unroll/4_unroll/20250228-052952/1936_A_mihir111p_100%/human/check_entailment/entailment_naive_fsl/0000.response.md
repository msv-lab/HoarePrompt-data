Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program uses `func_1` to compare bitwise OR results but does not handle the comparison results effectively to find the maximum XOR pair. Here's a detailed breakdown of the issues:

1. **Incorrect Query Handling**: The program does not properly utilize the comparison results from `func_1`. It seems to assume that the comparison result will directly guide the selection of indices, but this is not sufficient to ensure finding the maximum XOR pair.

2. **Logic Flaws**: The program initializes `ans1` to 0 and iterates through indices starting from 1, which is not a comprehensive approach to finding the maximum XOR pair. It also does not handle the comparison results correctly to update the indices for further queries.

3. **Missing Iteration and Comparison Logic**: The program lacks the necessary logic to iteratively refine the indices based on the comparison results. It should dynamically adjust the indices to explore different pairs and ensure the maximum XOR is found.

Given these issues, the program cannot guarantee finding the correct indices for the maximum XOR pair within the specified constraints. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
