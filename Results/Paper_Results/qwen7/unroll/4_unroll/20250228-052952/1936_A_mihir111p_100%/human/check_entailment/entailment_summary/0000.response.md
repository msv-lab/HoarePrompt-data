Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries.
2. The provided code attempts to solve this problem but contains several logical flaws and misunderstandings of the problem requirements.

### Issues with the Provided Code:
1. **Incorrect Query Handling:**
   - The code uses a function `func_1` to query the relative values of bitwise OR operations, but it incorrectly handles the results of these queries.
   - Specifically, the code only considers the first query result (`x = func_1(ans1, ans1, i, i)`) and updates `ans1` without considering the full strategy needed to maximize the XOR.

2. **Incomplete Strategy for Maximizing XOR:**
   - The code does not fully utilize the information obtained from the queries to identify the pair with the maximum XOR.
   - It seems to focus on a single path of queries rather than a comprehensive approach to explore all potential pairs.

3. **Query Pattern:**
   - The pattern of queries used in the code does not align with the optimal strategy to find the maximum XOR pair efficiently within the allowed 3n queries.

### Correct Approach:
1. **Identify the Most Significant Bit (MSB):**
   - Start by identifying the MSB of the numbers in the permutation. This can be done by querying pairs to determine the MSB bit position.

2. **Divide and Conquer:**
   - Use the identified MSB to divide the array into two parts: one containing numbers with the MSB set and the other with the MSB unset.
   - Recursively apply the same strategy to these subarrays until the subarray size is small enough to check all pairs directly.

3. **Check Pairs Directly:**
   - For smaller subarrays, check all pairs directly to find the maximum XOR.

### Conclusion:
The provided code does not correctly implement the required logic to find the maximum XOR pair within the constraints. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
