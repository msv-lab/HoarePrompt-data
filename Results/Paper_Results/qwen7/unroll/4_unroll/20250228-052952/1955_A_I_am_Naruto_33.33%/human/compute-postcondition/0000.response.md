Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object here is `int(input())`, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: The loop will execute as long as `int(input())` provides a positive integer value. Since `t` (a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) is the input that controls the number of iterations, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.

3. **State the final state**: The state before the loop starts is given as `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For the loop to execute, `t` must still satisfy this condition.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)**.
