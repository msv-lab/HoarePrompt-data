State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.
- The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
- Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it must be a positive integer for the loop to execute.
- The initial value of `t` being an input integer does not guarantee that `t` is greater than 0, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` must be greater than 0.
