Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. It also correctly reads the length of the strings and the three strings themselves.

2. **Initial Condition Check**: The initial check to see if `c` is equal to `a` or `b` is correct. If `c` is equal to `a` or `b`, it immediately prints "NO" and sets `no` to `False`.

3. **Character Matching Check**: The loop that checks if each character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b` is correct. If any character in `c` is not found in either `a` or `b`, it prints "YES" and sets `no` to `False`. However, this logic should only set `no` to `False` once and then break out of the loop to avoid printing "YES" multiple times for the same test case.

4. **Final Output**: The final check ensures that if `no` remains `True` after all checks, it prints "NO". This is correct because if no template can be found where `a` and `b` match but `c` does not, `no` will remain `True`.

Given the above points, the function logic is mostly correct but has a minor issue with the placement of the `break` statement. The current implementation might print "YES" multiple times for the same test case, which is not required according to the problem statement.

However, since the overall logic is sound and the problem constraints and requirements are met, the function can be considered correct with a minor adjustment to the `break` statement.

Correctness: **True**
