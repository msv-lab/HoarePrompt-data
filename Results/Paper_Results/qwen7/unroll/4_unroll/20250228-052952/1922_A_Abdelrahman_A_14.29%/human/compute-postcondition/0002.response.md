Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case (`i` in `range(tests)`), if character `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if every character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If so, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The final output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each test case.
