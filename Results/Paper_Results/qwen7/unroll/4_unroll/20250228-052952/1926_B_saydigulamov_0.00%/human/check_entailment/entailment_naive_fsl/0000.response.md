Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the grid contains a triangle or a square. Let's analyze why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid and then collects the counts of '1's in each row.
3. It then checks if the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal. If they are, it prints the counts without determining if the shape is a square or a triangle.

This approach is flawed because:
- It does not check the entire grid to see if the '1's form a triangle or a square.
- It only compares the counts of '1's in the first two rows, which is insufficient to determine the shape.

For example, consider the following grid:
```
5
00000
00000
01110
11111
01110
```
This grid contains a triangle, but the program would incorrectly identify it as a square because the counts of '1's in the first two rows are equal (0 and 0).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
