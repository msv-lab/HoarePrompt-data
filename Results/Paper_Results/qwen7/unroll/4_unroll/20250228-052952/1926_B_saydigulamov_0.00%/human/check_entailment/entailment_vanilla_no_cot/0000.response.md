Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape in the grid is a triangle or a square. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**: 
   - The program attempts to count the number of '1's in each row and checks if the counts are equal. This logic only works for squares but not for triangles.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 3, 5, ...), while for a square, the number of '1's in each row is constant.

2. **Incomplete Implementation**:
   - The program only prints `k` (which is the count of '1's in the first row) without checking the actual shape. It should compare the pattern of '1's to determine if they form a triangle or a square.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly identify the shape, you need to check the pattern of '1's in the grid. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Identify the Shape**:
   - For a square, the number of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the number of '1's in each row should increase by 2 starting from 1.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def identify_shape():
    a = int(input())
    for _ in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check for square
        square = True
        for row in grid:
            if row.count('1') != n // 2 + 1:
                square = False
                break
        
        # If it's not a square, check for triangle
        if not square:
            triangle = True
            for i in range(n):
                if grid[i].count('1') != 2 * i + 1:
                    triangle = False
                    break
            
            if triangle:
                print("TRIANGLE")
            else:
                print("UNKNOWN")  # In case neither square nor triangle is found, though the problem guarantees one of them
        else:
            print("SQUARE")

identify_shape()
```

This program correctly identifies whether the shape is a square or a triangle by checking the patterns in the grid.
