Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; `a` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ a ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of `a` strings, each string contains `a` characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that includes all the '1's in the grid.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `a`. The initial conditions for `t` and the grid structure remain unchanged. The value of `a` is constrained to be between 2 and 10, inclusive, based on the problem description.
