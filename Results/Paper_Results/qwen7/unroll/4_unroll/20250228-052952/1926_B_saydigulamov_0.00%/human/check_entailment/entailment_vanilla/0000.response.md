Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly identifies whether the given grid contains a square or a triangle.

### Analysis:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `a`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n` and then reads `n` lines of input.

2. **Data Processing:**
   - For each test case, it stores the count of '1's in each row in the list `k`.
   - If there is at least one '1' in a row, the program counts the number of '1's in that row.
   - After processing all rows, it checks if the first element of `k` is equal to the second element of `k`.

3. **Output:**
   - If the condition `k[0] == k[1]` is met, the program prints `k`, which is a list of counts of '1's in each row.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes:**
   - The program only checks if the first two elements of `k` are equal, which does not guarantee that the entire grid forms a square or a triangle.
   - For a square, the counts of '1's should be equal across all rows, but the program only checks the first two rows.
   - For a triangle, the counts of '1's should follow a specific pattern (e.g., 1, 3, 5, ...), but the program does not check this pattern.

2. **No Handling for Triangles:**
   - The program does not handle the case where the grid forms a triangle. It only checks for squares.

3. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints `k` instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

### Correct Implementation:

To correctly identify the shapes, we need to:
1. Check if the counts of '1's in each row match the pattern of a square or a triangle.
2. Print the appropriate shape name ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        n = int(input())
        k = []
        for _ in range(n):
            b = input().strip()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        # Check for square
        if len(set(k)) == 1 and min(k) > 1:
            print("SQUARE")
        # Check for triangle
        elif all(k[i] == 2 * i + 1 for i in range(len(k))):
            print("TRIANGLE")
        else:
            print("NEITHER")

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program is incorrect because it does not properly identify the shapes and does not handle the logic for both squares and triangles correctly. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
