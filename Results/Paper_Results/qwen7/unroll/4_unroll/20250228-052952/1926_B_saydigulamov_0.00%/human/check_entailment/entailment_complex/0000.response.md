Reasoning:
The provided function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here are the key issues:

1. **Incorrect Problem Interpretation**: The function only checks the first two rows for the count of '1's and prints them if they are equal. However, the problem requires identifying whether the entire grid forms a square or a triangle, not just checking the first two rows.

2. **Incomplete Logic**: The function does not check the rest of the grid to ensure that the pattern of '1's forms a complete square or triangle. It only considers the first two rows and does not validate the rest of the grid based on the identified pattern.

3. **No Handling of Triangle and Square Patterns**: The function does not implement any logic to identify if the '1's form a triangle or a square across the entire grid. It simply checks the count of '1's in the first two rows, which is insufficient to determine the shape.

Given these issues, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
