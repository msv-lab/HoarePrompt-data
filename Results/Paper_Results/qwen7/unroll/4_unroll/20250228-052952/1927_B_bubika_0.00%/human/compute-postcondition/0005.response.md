Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n. The function returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t`, another positive integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers. The function processes these inputs and returns some form of output based on the given data, though the specific output is not detailed in the provided information.
