Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n, `b` is a list of 26 zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `b` with 26 elements, all set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.
