Reasoning:
- The problem requires checking if an array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
- The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- `func_1` checks if the given array can be transformed into a sorted array by finding a subsequence in the concatenated array that matches the sorted version of the original array.
- However, `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It checks if the array can be split and swapped to form a sorted array by looking for a subsequence in the concatenated array, which is not the correct approach.
- The correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split at any point such that the left part is less than or equal to the right part after concatenation and swapping.
- Since `func_1` does not correctly implement this logic, it will not provide the correct answer for the problem.

Correctness: **False**
