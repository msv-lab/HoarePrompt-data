Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`, `idx` is 2, and `results` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the existing values of `data`, `t`, `n`, or `idx`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
