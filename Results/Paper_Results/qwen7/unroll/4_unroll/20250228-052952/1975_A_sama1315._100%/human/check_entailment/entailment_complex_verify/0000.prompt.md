You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Annotated Code: 
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of n positive integers (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) where each element is between 1 and 1,000,000 inclusive.
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    sorted_a = sorted(a)
    concatenated_a = a + a
    for i in range(n):
        if concatenated_a[i:i + len(sorted_a)] == sorted_a:
            return 'Yes'
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is a list of n positive integers; `n` is the length of the list `a`; `sorted_a` is a list of the same n elements as `a` but sorted in ascending order; `concatenated_a` is a list containing the elements of `a` followed by the elements of `a` again; The loop has executed all its iterations without finding any subsequence in `concatenated_a` that matches `sorted_a`, so it returns 'No'.
    return 'No'
    #The program returns 'No'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers `a` and checks if, when concatenating the list with itself, any subsequence matches the sorted version of the original list. If such a subsequence is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. After executing all iterations of the loop, if no matching subsequence is found, the function returns 'No'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array a. a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        
        idx += 1
        
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        
        idx += n
        
        result = func_1(a)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State: Output State: `data` is a list of strings, `t` is an integer, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`, `idx` is an integer greater than `t * (n + 1)`, and `results` is a list containing the results of calling `func_1(a)` for each iteration of the loop.
    print('\n'.join(results))
    #This is printed: each element of the `results` list on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer t indicating the number of subsequent test cases, an integer n indicating the length of an array a, and an array a of n integers. For each test case, it calls another function `func_1(a)` to perform an unspecified operation on the array a and collects the results. Finally, it prints each result on a new line.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not correctly implement the required functionality. Specifically, `func_1` checks if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts, but it does not actually perform the necessary checks to determine if such a split exists. Instead, it tries to find a subarray in the concatenated array that matches the sorted version of the original array, which is not a valid approach for this problem.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
No
```

However, the current implementation would incorrectly output "Yes" because it checks if the sorted array is a subarray of the concatenated array, which is not the correct logic for determining if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.

A correct approach would involve checking if the array can be split into two parts such that the first part is non-decreasing and the second part is non-decreasing, and the last element of the first part is less than or equal to the first element of the second part.
