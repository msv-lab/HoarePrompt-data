Output State: **`data` is a list of strings containing the input split by spaces, `t` is an integer equal to `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, representing the length of the array `a`, and `idx` is 2.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The other variables (`data`, `t`, and `n`) remain unchanged according to the initial state.
