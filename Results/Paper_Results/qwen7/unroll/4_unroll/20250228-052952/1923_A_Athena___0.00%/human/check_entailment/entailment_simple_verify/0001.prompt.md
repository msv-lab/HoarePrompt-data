You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a ribbon divided into n cells, numbered from 1 to n from left to
right. Each cell either contains a chip or is free.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
choose a chip and move it to the closest free cell to the left. You can choose
any chip that you want, provided that there is at least one free cell to the
left of it. When you move the chip, the cell where it was before the operation
becomes free.

Your goal is to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block,
without any free cells between them. What is the minimum number of operations
you have to perform?

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of cells; 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0 \le a_i \le 1 ); a_i = 0 means that the i -th cell is free; a_i = 1 means that the i -th cell contains a chip. 

Additional constraint on the input: in each test case, at least one cell
contains a chip.

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you
have to perform so that all chips form a single block without any free cells
between them.

Example

Input

    5
    
    8
    
    0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
    
    6
    
    0 1 0 0 0 0
    
    6
    
    1 1 1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 0 1 0 1
    
    9
    
    0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

Output

    1
    0
    0
    2
    3
    
Note

In the first example, you can perform the operation on the chip in the 7 -th
cell. The closest free cell to the left is the 5 -th cell, so it moves there.
After that, all chips form a single block.

In the second example, all chips are already in a single block. Same for the
third example.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        res = 0
        while a and a[0] == 0:
            a.pop(0)
        while a and a[-1] == 0:
            a.pop()
        print(a)
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if a[i] == 0:
                res += 1
        print(res)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n where each a_i is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free (0) or contains a chip (1); in each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cells `n` and the list of integers `a`, which represents whether each cell contains a chip (1) or is free (0).

2. **Removing Leading and Trailing Free Cells:**
   - The program removes leading free cells (cells with value 0 at the beginning of the list).
   - It also removes trailing free cells (cells with value 0 at the end of the list).
   - This step is not relevant to solving the problem since we need to move chips to form a single block, not just remove free cells.

3. **Counting Free Cells Between Chips:**
   - The program iterates through the list `a` and counts the number of free cells (0s) between chips (1s).
   - The count of these free cells is stored in `res`.

4. **Outputting Result:**
   - The program prints the result `res`, which should be the minimum number of operations needed to form a single block of chips.

### Problem Description vs. Program Logic

The problem requires moving chips to the closest free cell to the left until all chips form a single block. However, the given program does not actually perform any operations to move the chips. Instead, it simply counts the number of free cells between chips, which is not the same as the number of operations required.

### Example Analysis

Let's consider the examples provided:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells: `[1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Count of free cells between chips: `1` (correct, but not the actual operations)

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `6 0 1 0 0 0 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells: `[1]`
   - Count of free cells between chips: `0` (correct, but not the actual operations)

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `6 1 1 1 1 1 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Count of free cells between chips: `0` (correct, but not the actual operations)

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 1 0 1 0 1`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells: `[1, 0, 1, 0, 1]`
   - Count of free cells between chips: `2` (incorrect, should be 2 operations, not 2 free cells)

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `9 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0`
   - After removing leading and trailing free cells: `[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]`
   - Count of free cells between chips: `3` (incorrect, should be 3 operations, not 3 free cells)

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. It only counts the number of free cells between chips, which is not the same as the number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.
