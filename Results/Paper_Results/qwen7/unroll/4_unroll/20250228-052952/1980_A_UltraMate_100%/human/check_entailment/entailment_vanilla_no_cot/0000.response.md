Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create to ensure that he can conduct `m` rounds with at least one problem of each difficulty level ('A' to 'G'). Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of rounds).
   - It then reads the string `s` which contains the difficulties of the problems.
3. **Counting Required Problems**:
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each difficulty level in the input string `s`.
   - For each difficulty level from 'A' to 'G', it checks if the required number (`m`) of problems of that difficulty are available.
   - If not, it adds the difference between `m` and the current count to the answer `ans`.
4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the total number of additional problems needed for each test case.

This approach ensures that the program correctly computes the minimum number of additional problems needed for each test case, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.
