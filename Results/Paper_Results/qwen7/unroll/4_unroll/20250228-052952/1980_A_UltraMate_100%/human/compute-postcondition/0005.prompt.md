You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5. The string a consists of n characters, each character is a letter from 'A' to 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if i not in hmp:
                ans += m
        
        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of uppercase letters from A to G, and ans is an integer calculated based on the frequency of characters in s compared to m. After all iterations, ans contains the sum of additional occurrences of each character in p ('ABCDEFG') needed to match m in s, or the difference if there are more occurrences of a character in s than m allows.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes inputs through variables where t is an integer within the range 1 to 1000, and for each test case, n and m are integers within the ranges 1 to 50 and 1 to 5 respectively. Additionally, a is a string consisting of n characters, each being a letter from 'A' to 'G'. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
