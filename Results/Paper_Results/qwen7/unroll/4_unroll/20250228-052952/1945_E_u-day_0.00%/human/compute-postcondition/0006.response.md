Output State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`. `low` is set to 0, and `high` is set to `n - 1`. The variable `pos` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
