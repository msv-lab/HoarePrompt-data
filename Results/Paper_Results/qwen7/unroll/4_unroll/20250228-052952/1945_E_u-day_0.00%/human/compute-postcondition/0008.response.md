Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Current state before the loop**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.
   - `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`.
   - `st` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the necessary adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `low + 1 < high` must be true.
   - Given that `low` is 0 and `high` is `n - 1`, the condition `0 + 1 < n - 1` simplifies to `1 < n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n > 2`.
   - Therefore, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The only variables in the loop head are `low` and `high`, but since `low` and `high` are fixed values (0 and `n - 1` respectively), they cannot be adjusted.
   - However, the condition `low + 1 < high` requires `n` to be greater than 2.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n` is greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0, `high` is `n - 1`, `pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `k` in `arr`, or `-1` if `k` is not found in `arr`; `st` is an empty set, and `n` must be greater than 2**.
