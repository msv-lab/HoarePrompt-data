Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not work correctly for certain cases. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`. However, the logic inside `func_1` has a flaw. It uses `b[j:].find(a[i])`, which finds the first occurrence of `a[i]` starting from index `j` in `b`. This approach does not guarantee that the found index corresponds to the correct position in `b` relative to the current position `i` in `a`.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 5
100
11010
```

Expected Output:
```
3
```

However, the program will output:
```
2
```

This happens because `func_1` finds the first '0' in `b` starting from index `2`, which is at index `3` in `b`. The program increments `j` to `3` and `i` to `2`, resulting in a count of `2` instead of `3`.

To fix this, the function should ensure that the found index in `b` is correctly aligned with the current position in `a`. One way to achieve this is by iterating through `b` and checking for the exact match of the substring starting from the current position in `a`.

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(a, b, i, j):
    while j < m:
        if b[j:j+i+1] == a[:i+1]:
            return j
        j += 1
    return -1
```

With this correction, the program should work correctly for all cases.
