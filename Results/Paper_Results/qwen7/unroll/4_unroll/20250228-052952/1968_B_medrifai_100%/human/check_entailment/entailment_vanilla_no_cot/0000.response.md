Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`. The outer loop iterates over each test case, and for each test case, it uses an inner function `func_1` to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in the remaining part of `b`. If found, it updates the indices and continues; otherwise, it breaks out of the loop. The variable `c` keeps track of the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`, which is printed at the end of each test case. The implementation matches the problem description accurately.
