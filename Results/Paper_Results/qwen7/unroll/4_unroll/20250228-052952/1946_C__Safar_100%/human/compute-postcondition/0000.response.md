Output State: **`g` is a list of lists where each element at index i (from 0 to n) is an empty list, `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `k` is an integer representing the number of edges to be removed.**

The code initializes a list of lists `g` where each sublist corresponds to a vertex in the tree. Since there are `n` vertices, the list `g` contains `n+1` sublists (indexing from 0 to n), and each of these sublists is initialized as an empty list. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
