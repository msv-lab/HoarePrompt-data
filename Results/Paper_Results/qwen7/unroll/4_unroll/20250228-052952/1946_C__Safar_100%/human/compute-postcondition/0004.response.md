Output State: **`c` is 0**.

The initial state defines `g` as a list of lists representing an undirected graph with `n` vertices and `k` edges. The variable `c` is initialized to 0. The line `c = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to `c`. No other variables are affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `c` is now 0, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.
