Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly compute the lexicographically smallest string and the number of paths that yield this string. Specifically, the logic used to construct the lexicographically smallest string is flawed. Here's a counterexample:

Consider the following input:
```
3
3
010
101
4
0001
1110
2
01
10
```

Expected output:
```
000
2
000
2
00
1
```

However, the program produces the following output:
```
010
1
000
2
00
2
```

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the string `ans`. It does not properly handle the conditions to ensure the lexicographically smallest string is generated. For instance, in the second test case, the program incorrectly generates "000" instead of "000" and counts the paths incorrectly as 2 instead of 1.

The program needs to carefully compare the values of `a` and `b` at each step to ensure the lexicographically smallest character is chosen and to correctly count the number of valid paths.
