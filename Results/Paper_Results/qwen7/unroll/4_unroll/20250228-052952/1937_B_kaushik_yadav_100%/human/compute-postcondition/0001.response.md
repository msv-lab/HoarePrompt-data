Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 remains valid, and now `t` is also assigned the value read from the input. For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, but the value of `n` is yet to be determined and will be read in subsequent lines.
