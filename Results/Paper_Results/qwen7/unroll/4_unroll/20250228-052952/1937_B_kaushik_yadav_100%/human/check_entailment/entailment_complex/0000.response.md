Reasoning:

1. **Function Logic Analysis**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions (`n`) and the two binary strings (`a` and `b`).
   - The logic for constructing the lexicographically smallest string `ans` is correct. It alternates between characters from `a` and `b` based on the condition that ensures the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.
   - The logic for counting the number of consecutive positions where `a[j+1]` equals `b[j]` or `a[j+1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1' is also correct.

2. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The function handles the constraints appropriately, ensuring that the sum of all `n` values does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The function correctly processes each test case independently, resetting necessary variables for each new test case.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The function prints the lexicographically smallest string `ans` and the count of consecutive positions as required by the problem statement.

Given the analysis above, the function correctly implements the solution to the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
