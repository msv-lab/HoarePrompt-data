The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases), an integer `n` (length of binary strings), and two binary strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. For each test case, it constructs a new string `ans` by alternating characters from `a` and `b` under specific conditions. Additionally, it counts the number of consecutive positions where `a[j+1]` equals `b[j]` or `a[j+1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1', and prints both `ans` and the count for each test case.
