You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

- Program: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))



- Annotated Code: 
t = int(input())
for t in range(t, 0, -1):
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    print(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)
    #This is printed: n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        print(1, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
        print(2, i, *range(n, 0, -1))
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500, and the following outputs are produced:
    #- For each i from 1 to n (inclusive), two lines are printed:
    #  1. A line starting with 1, followed by i and then the numbers from n down to 1.
    #  2. A line starting with 2, followed by i and then the numbers from n down to 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a single test case defined by an integer \( n \) (where \( 1 \leq n \leq 500 \)). It calculates and prints the value of \( n \times (n + 1) \times (4 \times n - 1) // 6 \) followed by \( 2 \times n \). Subsequently, for each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( n \) (inclusive), it prints two lines: the first starting with 1 and the second with 2, each followed by \( i \) and the numbers from \( n \) down to 1. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the specified outputs.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly maximize the sum of the matrix as described in the problem statement. According to the problem, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations. The program attempts to achieve this by performing two operations of type 1 and 2 for each row, setting each element in the row to the value of its position in reverse order (i.e., \(n, n-1, \ldots, 1\)).

However, this approach does not necessarily maximize the sum of the matrix. For example, consider a \(2 \times 2\) matrix. The program will set the matrix as follows:
```
1 2
1 2
```
This results in a sum of \(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 6\). However, the optimal configuration for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix would be:
```
2 1
1 2
```
which gives a sum of \(2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6\), but the arrangement is different. The program's approach does not guarantee that the maximum possible sum is achieved, especially for larger matrices.

To illustrate, let's consider a \(3 \times 3\) matrix. The program will set the matrix as:
```
3 2 1
3 2 1
3 2 1
```
This results in a sum of \(3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 18\). However, the optimal configuration for a \(3 \times 3\) matrix would be:
```
3 1 2
2 3 1
1 2 3
```
which gives a sum of \(3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 18\), but again, the arrangement is different. The program's approach does not ensure the maximum sum is achieved.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, making it incorrect.
