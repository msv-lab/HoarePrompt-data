Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. This means `i` will take values from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), but this variable is not used in the loop.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 500\) and is assigned the value of `int(input())`. This means `n` is determined at runtime based on user input.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 1.
   - `n` should be set to the value provided by `int(input())`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` is the value provided by `int(input())`**
