Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. The annotated program initializes the number of test cases \(t\), and for each test case, it calculates the maximum possible sum and the required number of operations.
3. The formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) // 6\) is derived from the properties of permutations and the structure of the matrix, which correctly gives the maximum sum achievable.
4. The program then performs exactly \(2n\) operations, alternating between row and column permutations to achieve the maximum sum. Each operation is correctly formatted according to the problem's requirements.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
