Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Minimum Cards Calculation**:
   - The logic in the current implementation only checks if the maximum count of any card (`max(p)`) is greater than or equal to `k`. If it is, it prints `k - 1`. This is not always correct.
   - For instance, consider the case where `n = 5`, `k = 3`, and the cards are `[4, 1, 1, 4, 4]`. The maximum count here is `4` (for card `4`), but the optimal solution should be `2` (not `2` but `2` because we can reduce it further by exchanging groups of `3`).

2. **Failing to Handle Cases Where Maximum Count is Less Than k**:
   - In such cases, the current implementation incorrectly prints `n`. It should instead print `n` if no exchanges can be made.

3. **Optimal Strategy**:
   - To find the minimum number of cards, we need to keep reducing groups of `k` cards until we can't anymore. The key insight is to keep reducing the largest groups first.

### Correct Solution:
A more accurate approach would involve repeatedly reducing the counts of the most frequent cards until no more reductions are possible. Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        counts = {}
        for card in l:
            counts[card] = counts.get(card, 0) + 1
        
        while True:
            max_count = max(counts.values())
            if max_count < k:
                break
            for card in list(counts.keys()):
                if counts[card] >= k:
                    counts[card] -= k
                    counts[card - 1] = counts.get(card - 1, 0) + k - 1
                    del counts[card]
        
        result = sum(1 for count in counts.values() if count > 0)
        print(result)

func()
```

This revised solution correctly handles the problem by continuously reducing the counts of the most frequent cards until no more reductions are possible, ensuring the minimum number of cards is calculated accurately.
