Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer input from the user, each k is an integer determined by the loop's logic based on the inputs b, c, d, and e for each iteration of the outer loop.

The value of `k` for each iteration of the outer loop depends on the specific inputs `b`, `c`, `d`, and `e`. After all iterations of the outer loop have finished, `t` and `a` will retain their initial values, but each `k` will reflect the result of the inner loop's logic for the corresponding `i` in the range of `a`.
