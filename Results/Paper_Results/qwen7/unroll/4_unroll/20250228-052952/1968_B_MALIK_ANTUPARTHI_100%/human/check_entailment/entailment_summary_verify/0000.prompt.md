You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            if d[j] in e[k:]:
                k = e[k:].index(d[j]) + 1 + k
                if k == c or j == b - 1:
                    k = j + 1
                    break
            else:
                k = j
                break
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( b \) and \( c \), and two binary strings \( d \) and \( e \). It then determines an integer \( k \) based on the logic of finding the first occurrence of \( d \) within \( e \) considering the constraints defined by \( b \) and \( c \). The function prints \( k \) for each test case and retains the initial values of \( t \) and \( a \) after completing all test cases.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the program's logic for updating the index `k` is flawed. 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 5
10101
11101
```
- Expected Output: `3`
- Actual Output: `2`

The program fails because it does not correctly handle the scenario where the current character of `a` is found in `b`, but the next character of `a` cannot be found starting from the last found position in `b`. The program should continue searching from the next position after the found character, but it breaks out of the loop prematurely.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        d = input()
        e = input()
        k = 0
        for j in range(b):
            found = False
            for l in range(k, c):
                if d[j] == e[l]:
                    k = l + 1
                    found = True
                    break
            if not found:
                break
        print(k)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program continues searching for the next character of `a` starting from the correct position in `b` and handles the case where the entire prefix of `a` can be found as a subsequence of `b`.
