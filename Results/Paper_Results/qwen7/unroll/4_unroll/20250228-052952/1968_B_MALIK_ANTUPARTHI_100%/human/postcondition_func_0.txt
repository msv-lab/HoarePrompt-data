The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts two integers \( b \) and \( c \), and two binary strings \( d \) and \( e \). It then determines an integer \( k \) based on the logic of finding the first occurrence of \( d \) within \( e \) considering the constraints defined by \( b \) and \( c \). The function prints \( k \) for each test case and retains the initial values of \( t \) and \( a \) after completing all test cases.
