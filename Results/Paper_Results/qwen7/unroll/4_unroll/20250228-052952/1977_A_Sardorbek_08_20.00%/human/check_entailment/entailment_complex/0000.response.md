Reasoning:
The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Checks**:
   - The condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves equals the number of cubes, which is correct.
   - The condition `elif b < c:` checks if the number of moves is less than the number of cubes, which is incorrect because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves without removing cubes.
   - The condition `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` checks if the number of moves and the number of cubes have the same parity (both even or both odd), which is necessary but not sufficient. This condition alone does not cover all cases where it's possible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

2. **Missing Condition for Achieving the Desired Number of Cubes**:
   - To achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves, the number of moves that add cubes must equal the number of moves that remove cubes plus `m`. This means that `n` must be at least `m` and the difference between `n` and `m` must be even (since each addition and removal cancels out).

3. **Output Format**:
   - The program should print "Yes" or "No" in lowercase, not "YES" or "Yes". Although the problem statement allows for case-insensitive answers, the program should follow the specified format.

Given these issues, the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
