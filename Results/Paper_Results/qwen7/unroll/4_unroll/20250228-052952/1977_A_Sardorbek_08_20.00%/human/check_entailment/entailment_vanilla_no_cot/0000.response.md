Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:

1. The variable `a` is used both as the number of test cases and in the loop condition, which is incorrect.
2. The check `elif a % 2 == b % 2:` is not necessary and does not correctly determine if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves.
3. The program should check if `n` is greater than or equal to `m` and if `n - m` is even, because each pair of moves (one add and one remove) cancels out to zero net change in the number of cubes.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())  # Number of test cases
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        if n >= m and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This version correctly checks if it's possible to end up with `m` cubes after `n` moves by ensuring `n` is at least `m` and the difference `(n - m)` is even.
