Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two positive integers n and m within the range of 1 to 100, where n and m are derived from a test case. It returns a value based on the relationship between n and m.**

Note: The actual processing logic based on n and m is not detailed here as per the instruction to focus only on parameters and return value.
