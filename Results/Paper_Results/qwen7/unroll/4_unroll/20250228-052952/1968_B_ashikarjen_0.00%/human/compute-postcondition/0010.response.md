Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. For each test case, it counts and prints the number of characters in `a` that also appear in `b` up to index `m-1`. After processing all test cases, the function outputs the count for each test case.**
