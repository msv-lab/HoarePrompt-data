Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` is 0**.

The code initializes `k` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
