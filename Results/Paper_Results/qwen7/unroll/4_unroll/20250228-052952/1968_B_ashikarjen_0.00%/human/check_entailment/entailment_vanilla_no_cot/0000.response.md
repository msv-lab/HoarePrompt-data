Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`.

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Input Parsing**: It reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.
2. **Initialization**: It initializes `k` to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`. `j` is initialized to 0 and will be used to iterate through `b`.
3. **Loop Through String `a`**: The loop iterates through each character of `a` using index `i`.
   - Inside the loop, it uses a `while` loop to find the corresponding character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If a matching character is found, it increments both `k` and `j`.
   - If no matching character is found before reaching the end of `b`, the loop breaks.
4. **Output**: After the loop, it prints the value of `k`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` for each test case. Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the function works as expected.
