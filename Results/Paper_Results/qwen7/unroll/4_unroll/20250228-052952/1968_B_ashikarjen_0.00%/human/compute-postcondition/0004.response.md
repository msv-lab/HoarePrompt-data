Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `a` is an input string, `b` is a string input by the user, `k` is 0**

Explanation: The line `j = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `j`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged from their initial states.
