Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` is not sufficient to determine whether Nikita can obtain a tower with `m` cubes after `n` moves. 

Consider the test case `(n=5, m=3)`:
- Nikita can start with an empty tower and perform the following sequence of moves: add, add, remove, add, add. This results in a tower with 3 cubes after 5 moves, which should be a valid scenario.

However, the current implementation does not account for this possibility. The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` only checks if the parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` is the same, but it does not ensure that the number of additions and removals can achieve the desired result. 

A correct solution would involve checking if the absolute difference between `n` and `m` is less than or equal to `n`, and ensuring that `n` is greater than or equal to `m`. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) <= b and b >= c:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This corrected version ensures that the number of moves `n` is sufficient to achieve the desired number of cubes `m` and handles all potential cases correctly.
