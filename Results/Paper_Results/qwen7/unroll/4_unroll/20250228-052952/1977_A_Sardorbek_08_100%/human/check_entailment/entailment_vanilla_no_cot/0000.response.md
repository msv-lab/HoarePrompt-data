Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition for "Yes":**
   - The condition `if b == c:` checks if the number of moves (`b`) equals the number of cubes (`c`). This is not sufficient because Nikita can also achieve the desired number of cubes by making an even number of additions and subtractions that balance out.
   - The condition `elif b % 2 == c % 2:` checks if the parity (even or odd nature) of `b` and `c` is the same. This is necessary but not sufficient alone.
   - The correct condition should be that the absolute difference between `b` and `c` must be even, because each move changes the number of cubes by 1 (either adding or removing).

2. **Output Format:**
   - The program prints 'YES' or 'NO' in all capital letters, which is acceptable, but the format should match the problem statement exactly (i.e., "Yes" or "No").

### Corrected Program:
```python
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        (b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')

func()
```

This corrected version checks if the absolute difference between `b` and `c` is even, which ensures that the operations can balance to achieve the desired number of cubes.
