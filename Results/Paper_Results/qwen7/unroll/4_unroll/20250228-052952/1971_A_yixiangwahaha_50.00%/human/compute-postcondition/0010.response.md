Functionality: **The function reads 10 pairs of integers from the input, where each pair consists of two integers \(x\) and \(y\). It then prints 10 lines, each containing two integers separated by a space. For each pair, if \(x\) is less than \(y\), it prints \(x\) followed by \(y\); otherwise, it prints \(y\) followed by \(x\). The function does not return any value.**
