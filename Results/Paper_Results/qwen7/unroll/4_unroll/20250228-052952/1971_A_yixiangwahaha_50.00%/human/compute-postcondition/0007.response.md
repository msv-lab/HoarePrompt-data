Output State: The output state will consist of 10 lines, each line containing two integers separated by a space. For each iteration `i` from 0 to 9, if the value of `x[i]` is less than the value of `y[i]`, the line will display `x[i]` followed by `y[i]`. Otherwise, it will display `y[i]` followed by `x[i]`.
