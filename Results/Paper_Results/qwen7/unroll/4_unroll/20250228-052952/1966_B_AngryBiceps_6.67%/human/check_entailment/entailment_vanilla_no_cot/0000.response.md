Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution is incorrect because it does not correctly determine whether it is possible to make all squares in the grid the same color using the allowed operations. The logic in the current implementation only checks if the first and last rows have different colors or if the first and last elements of the grid are different. This is insufficient to determine the overall possibility of making all squares the same color.

To solve this problem correctly, you need to check if there exists a row or column where all squares are the same color. If such a row or column exists, then it is possible to make all squares the same color by performing operations along that row or column. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if any row or column has all squares of the same color
        for i in range(n):
            if len(set(a[i])) == 1:
                print('YES')
                break
        else:
            for j in range(m):
                col = ''.join([a[i][j] for i in range(n)])
                if len(set(col)) == 1:
                    print('YES')
                    break
            else:
                print('NO')

func()
```

This code checks each row and each column to see if they are uniformly colored. If any row or column is found to be uniformly colored, it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".
