Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions checked within the loop for each test case. For each test case, if the first row is uniform and different from the last row, or if any row is uniform and different from its corresponding column's first and last elements, it prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'YES'. The number of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the input provided for each test case.
