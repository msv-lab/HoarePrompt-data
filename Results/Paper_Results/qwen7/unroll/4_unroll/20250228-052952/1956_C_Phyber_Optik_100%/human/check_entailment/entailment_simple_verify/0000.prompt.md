You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The magical girl Nene has an n\times n matrix a filled with zeroes. The j -th
element of the i -th row of matrix a is denoted as a_{i, j} .

She can perform operations of the following two types with this matrix:

  * Type 1 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{i, j}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 
  * Type 2 operation: choose an integer i between 1 and n and a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n . Assign a_{j, i}:=p_j for all 1 \le j \le n simultaneously. 

Nene wants to maximize the sum of all the numbers in the matrix
\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}\sum\limits_{j=1}^{n}a_{i,j} . She asks you to find the
way to perform the operations so that this sum is maximized. As she doesn't
want to make too many operations, you should provide a solution with no more
than 2n operations.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 500 )
— the size of the matrix a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5
\cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, in the first line output two integers s and m (0\leq m\leq
2n ) — the maximum sum of the numbers in the matrix and the number of
operations in your solution.

In the k -th of the next m lines output the description of the k -th
operation:

  * an integer c (c \in \\{1, 2\\} ) — the type of the k -th operation; 
  * an integer i (1 \le i \le n ) — the row or the column the k -th operation is applied to; 
  * a permutation p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n of integers from 1 to n — the permutation used in the k -th operation. 

Note that you don't need to minimize the number of operations used, you only
should use no more than 2n operations. It can be shown that the maximum
possible sum can always be obtained in no more than 2n operations.

Example

Input

    2
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    1 1
    1 1 1
    7 3
    1 1 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 1 1 2
    
Note

In the first test case, the maximum sum s=1 can be obtained in 1 operation by
setting a_{1, 1}:=1 .

In the second test case, the maximum sum s=7 can be obtained in 3 operations
as follows:

It can be shown that it is impossible to make the sum of the numbers in the
matrix larger than 7 .

    #State: Output State: The output consists of multiple lines for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, it prints the value of `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two blocks of lines. Each block contains `n` lines where the first column alternates between 1 and 2, the second column decreases from `n` to 1, and the third column is a range from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #For each value of `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500), the loop will execute `t` times, producing the described output for each `n` provided in the input.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program attempts to calculate a sum using a formula and prints `n + n` operations, which is not aligned with the problem's requirements.

According to the problem description, Nene needs to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations, where each operation involves either permuting rows or columns. The program instead calculates a sum using a formula that does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through permutations.

To illustrate why the program is incorrect, consider the following example:

- For \( n = 2 \):
  - The initial matrix is:
    ```
    0 0
    0 0
    ```
  - The program outputs:
    ```
    7 4
    1 2 1 2
    1 2 1 2
    2 2 1 2
    2 2 1 2
    ```

However, the correct approach would involve permuting the rows and columns to fill the matrix with the highest possible values. For \( n = 2 \), the optimal solution would be:
- Permute the first row to `[1, 2]`.
- Permute the second row to `[2, 1]`.

This results in the matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```
The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is higher than the sum calculated by the program (7).

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases, making it incorrect.
