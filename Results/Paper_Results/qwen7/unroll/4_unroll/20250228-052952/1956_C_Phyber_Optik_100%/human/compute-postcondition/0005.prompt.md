You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n^2 over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        
        print(sum, n + n)
        
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: The output consists of multiple lines for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, it prints the value of `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two blocks of lines. Each block contains `n` lines where the first column alternates between 1 and 2, the second column decreases from `n` to 1, and the third column is a range from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #For each value of `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500), the loop will execute `t` times, producing the described output for each `n` provided in the input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where for each case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) is provided. The integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is also given for each test case, and the sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operations based on `t` and `n`, but the exact operations are not detailed here. The function returns results for each test case as specified by the problem constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
