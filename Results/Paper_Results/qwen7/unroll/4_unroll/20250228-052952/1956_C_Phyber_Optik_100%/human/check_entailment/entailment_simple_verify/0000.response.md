### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the problem and the provided program.

#### Problem Description:
- Nene needs to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using up to \( 2n \) operations.
- Operations can either permute the elements of a row or a column.
- The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

#### Provided Program:
```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        sum = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        print(sum, n + n)
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
```

#### Analysis:
1. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program calculates a sum using a formula: `sum = 1 + (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for \( i \) from 2 to \( n \).
   - This formula does not relate to the problem's objective of maximizing the matrix sum through permutations.

2. **Operations:**
   - The program prints `n + n` operations, which are not aligned with the problem's requirement of performing up to \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation is of the form:
     - `1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` (permuting a row)
     - `2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1)` (permuting a column)
   - These operations do not necessarily maximize the matrix sum.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     - Initial matrix:
       ```
       0 0
       0 0
       ```
     - Program output:
       ```
       7 4
       1 2 1 2
       1 2 1 2
       2 2 1 2
       2 2 1 2
       ```
     - Correct approach:
       - Permute the first row to `[1, 2]`.
       - Permute the second row to `[2, 1]`.
       - Resulting matrix:
         ```
         1 2
         2 1
         ```
       - Sum: \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \)

The program's approach does not correctly maximize the matrix sum. Instead, it calculates a sum using a formula that is unrelated to the problem and performs operations that do not align with the goal of maximizing the sum.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description.

**Final: False**
