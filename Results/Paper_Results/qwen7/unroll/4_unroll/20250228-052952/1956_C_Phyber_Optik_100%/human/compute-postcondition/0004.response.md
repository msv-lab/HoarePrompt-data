Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters. It processes a series of test cases where for each case, an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500) is provided. The integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) is also given for each test case, and the sum of n^2 across all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, it performs some unspecified operations based on `t` and `n`, but the exact operations are not detailed here. The function returns results for each test case as specified by the problem constraints.**

Note: The exact operations within the function are not detailed in the given information, so the functionality focuses on the constraints and expected behavior based on those constraints.
