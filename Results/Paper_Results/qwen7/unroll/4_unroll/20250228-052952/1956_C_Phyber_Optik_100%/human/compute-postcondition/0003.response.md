Output State: The output consists of multiple lines for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, it prints the value of `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two blocks of lines. Each block contains `n` lines where the first column alternates between 1 and 2, the second column decreases from `n` to 1, and the third column is a range from 1 to `n`.

For each value of `t` (1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500), the loop will execute `t` times, producing the described output for each `n` provided in the input.
