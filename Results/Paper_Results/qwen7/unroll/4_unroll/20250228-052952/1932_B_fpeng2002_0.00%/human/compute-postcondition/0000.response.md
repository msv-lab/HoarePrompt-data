Output State: **`num_tests` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `num_tests = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `num_tests`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` (which is now `num_tests`) is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the value of `num_tests` will be an integer within this range. The values of `n` and the list `a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots, a_n` remain unchanged as they have not been referenced or modified in the given code snippet.
