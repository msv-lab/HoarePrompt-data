Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here are the issues:

1. **Logic for Checking Best Friends**: The program checks if `q == i + 1` which is incorrect. According to the problem statement, the best friend of the `i-th` friend is `p[i]`, and we need to check if `l[p-1]` equals `i+1`. This logic should be checking if the best friend of the best friend (`p[p[i]-1]`) is `i+1`.

2. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program assumes that if it finds a pair of best friends where both receive invitations, only 2 invitations are needed. However, this logic is incomplete and does not handle cases where more than 2 friends might need to be invited.

3. **Edge Cases**: The program does not handle edge cases properly. For example, in the third test case, it incorrectly prints `2` instead of `3`.

### Corrected Program:
Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Check for direct best friend pairs
        for i in range(n):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            # If no direct best friend pairs found, check for indirect pairs
            visited = [False] * n
            for i in range(n):
                if not visited[i]:
                    cycle_size = 0
                    current = i
                    while not visited[current]:
                        visited[current] = True
                        current = l[current] - 1
                        cycle_size += 1
                    if cycle_size >= 2:
                        print(cycle_size)
                        break
            else:
                print(n)  # If no cycles of size >= 2, all friends must be invited

func()
```

This corrected program:
1. Checks for direct best friend pairs.
2. If no direct pairs are found, it checks for cycles in the graph formed by the best friends relationships.
3. If a cycle of size 2 or more is found, it prints the size of the cycle.
4. If no such cycle exists, it prints the total number of friends, indicating that all friends need to be invited.
