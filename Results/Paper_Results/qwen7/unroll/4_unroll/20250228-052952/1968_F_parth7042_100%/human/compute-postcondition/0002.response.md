Output State: **`index` is 1, `t` is an integer value from the list `data` at position 0.**

Explanation: The code assigns the integer value from the list `data` at the current index (`index` which is 0) to the variable `t`. After this assignment, the index is incremented by 1, so the new value of `index` is 1. The value of `t` is now an integer extracted from the list `data`. The original value of `t` as an integer between 1 and \(10^4\) remains valid, but its specific value is now stored in `t`.
