You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

- Program:
import sys
from collections import defaultdict
from bisect import bisect_left

input = sys.stdin.read
func_1()

def func_1():
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        q = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        a = [0] * (n + 1)
        pf = [0] * (n + 1)
        mp = defaultdict(list)
        mp[0].append(0)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            a[i] = int(data[index])
            index += 1
            pf[i] = pf[i - 1] ^ a[i]
            mp[pf[i]].append(i)
        for _ in range(q):
            l = int(data[index])
            r = int(data[index + 1])
            index += 2
            x = pf[r] ^ pf[l - 1]
            if x == 0:
                results.append('YES')
                continue
            v1 = mp[pf[r]]
            v2 = mp[pf[l - 1]]
            it1 = bisect_left(v1, l)
            it2 = bisect_left(v2, r) - 1
            if it1 < len(v1) and it2 >= 0 and (v1[it1] < v2[it2]):
                results.append('YES')
            else:
                results.append('NO')
    print('\n'.join(results))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer t, followed by integers n and q, and a list of n integers a_1,...,a_n. For each query (l, r), it determines whether the XOR of the subarray from index l to r is zero. If the XOR is zero, it appends 'YES' to the results list; otherwise, it appends 'NO'. After processing all queries for each test case, it prints the results list, which contains alternating 'YES' and 'NO' based on the queries processed.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting according to the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the input correctly using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to extract the necessary values for `t`, `n`, `q`, and the array elements.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR (`pf`) efficiently, which is crucial for determining the XOR of any subarray.

3. **Mapping Prefix XOR Values**: The program uses a dictionary (`mp`) to map each unique prefix XOR value to its indices. This helps in quickly finding the positions where the prefix XOR matches certain values.

4. **Query Processing**: For each query, the program computes the required XOR value (`x`) and checks if it can be achieved by splitting the subarray into two parts with equal XOR values. It uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the appropriate indices and ensures the conditions for a valid split are met.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases such as when the XOR of the entire subarray is zero, which is a straightforward condition for the subarray to be interesting.

Given the thorough implementation and the logical steps taken to handle the problem, the program works correctly for all potential cases within the constraints provided. There are no apparent flaws or missing edge cases that would cause the program to fail under any circumstances. Therefore, the program is correct.
