### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It then iterates through this list to extract the necessary values for each test case.

2. **Prefix XOR Array Calculation:**
   - The program initializes arrays `a` and `pf` where `pf[i]` stores the prefix XOR up to index `i-1`.
   - It also uses a dictionary `mp` to map each unique prefix XOR value to a list of indices where this XOR value occurs.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray from `l` to `r` using the prefix XOR values.
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, the subarray is considered interesting because it can be divided into one part with XOR 0.
   - Otherwise, it checks if there exists a valid split by using binary search (`bisect_left`) to find appropriate indices in the mapped lists.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program handles edge cases correctly by ensuring that the indices are within bounds and checking the conditions properly.

5. **Output:**
   - The program appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the `results` list based on the conditions checked and prints the results at the end.

### Analysis:
- The logic for calculating the prefix XOR and mapping the XOR values to their indices is correct.
- The use of binary search to find the appropriate split points is appropriate and correctly implemented.
- The handling of the queries and the final output is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is interesting based on the provided problem description.

### Correctness:
**True**
