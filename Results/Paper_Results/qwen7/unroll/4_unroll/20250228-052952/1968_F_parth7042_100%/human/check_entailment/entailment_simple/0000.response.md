Reasoning:
1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into a list of strings. This is a good approach for handling large inputs efficiently.
2. **Data Structures Initialization**: The program initializes necessary data structures like prefix XOR array (`pf`), a dictionary to store indices of prefix XOR values (`mp`), and an empty list `results` to store the answers for each query.
3. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: It calculates the prefix XOR for each element in the array and stores the indices where each unique prefix XOR value occurs.
4. **Query Processing**: For each query, it calculates the XOR of the subarray and checks if it can be divided into parts with equal XOR values. The logic for checking this is sound:
   - If the XOR of the subarray is zero, the subarray is trivially interesting.
   - Otherwise, it uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find suitable split points within the stored indices.
5. **Output**: The program outputs the results in the correct format.

Given the detailed analysis, the program appears to follow the correct logic and handles the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
