Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, `data` is a list of strings representing the split input.**

Explanation: The code `data = input().split()` reads a line of input from the user and splits it into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variable `t` remains unchanged from its initial state, and a new variable `data` is created and assigned the split input. The values of `n` and `q`, and the list of integers `a_1,...,a_n` are not yet known as they will be read in subsequent lines.
