Based on the initial state provided:

- `s` is an input string.
- `n` is the integer value calculated from `len(s)`, meaning `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `x` is the index of the first character in `s` that does not match the first character. This means that `s[0]` is different from `s[x]`.
- `func_1(s)` returns `True`, indicating that there is at least one character in the substring `s[x + 1:]` that matches the first character of `s`.
- The value of `x` is neither 1 nor `n // 2`.

Given this information, the print statement `print(2)` will simply print the number 2.

Output: **2**
