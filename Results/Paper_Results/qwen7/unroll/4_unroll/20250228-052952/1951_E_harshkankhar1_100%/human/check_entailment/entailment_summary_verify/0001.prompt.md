You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(s) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    s = input()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    if func_1(s[0:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[0]:
            x = i
            break
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
        return
    if func_1(s[x + 1:]) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 1], ' ', s[x + 1:])
    elif x == 1 or x == n // 2:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x + 2], ' ', s[x + 2:])



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function processes an input string `s` and checks certain conditions related to the string. It does not return any value. Depending on the conditions met, it prints one of two messages ('YES' or 'NO') along with some indices or substrings of the input string. The function also calls another function `func_1` which is not detailed here but assumed to return a boolean value.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function checks if a string `s` is a palindrome.
   - It returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.
   - This function is used correctly in the main logic of `func_2`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function attempts to partition the input string `s` into non-palindromic substrings.
   - It reads the input string `s` from standard input.
   - It checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1(s[0:])`.
     - If `s` is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `1`, and `s` itself as the partition.
     - If `s` is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`).
       - If such a character is found, it splits the string at that position.
         - It checks if the substring after the split point is not a palindrome.
           - If the substring after the split is not a palindrome, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two parts of the split.
           - If the substring after the split is a palindrome, it further checks if the split point is at the beginning or middle of the string.
             - If the split point is at the beginning or middle, it prints "NO".
             - Otherwise, it prints "YES", `2`, and the two parts of the split.
     - If no such character is found, it prints "NO".

### Correctness Check

1. **Case 1: Single Non-Palindromic String**:
   - If the entire string `s` is not a palindrome, the program correctly identifies this and outputs "YES", `1`, and the string itself.
   - Example: `sinktheyacht` → Output: `YES\n1\nsinktheyacht`

2. **Case 2: Entire String is Palindrome**:
   - If the entire string `s` is a palindrome, the program correctly identifies this and outputs "NO".
   - Example: `lllllllll` → Output: `NO`

3. **Case 3: Splitting at First Non-Matching Character**:
   - If the string can be split at the first non-matching character, the program correctly identifies this and outputs "YES", `2`, and the two parts.
   - Example: `uwuowouwu` → Output: `YES\n3\nuw uow ouwu`
   - Note: The example in the problem description incorrectly states `YES\n3\nuw uow ouwu` should be `YES\n2\nuw uow ouwu`. However, the program logic matches the intended behavior.

4. **Case 4: No Valid Split**:
   - If no valid split can be made, the program correctly identifies this and outputs "NO".
   - Example: `aaaaaa` → Output: `NO`

### Conclusion

The given program correctly handles all the cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
