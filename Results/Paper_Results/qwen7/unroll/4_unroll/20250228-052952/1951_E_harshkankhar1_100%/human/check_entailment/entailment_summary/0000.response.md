Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether `func_2` correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the requirements and the implementation:

### Requirements:
1. The program should handle multiple test cases.
2. For each test case, it should check if the string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of the substrings are palindromes.
3. If such a partition exists, it should print "YES", the number of parts, and the parts themselves.
4. If no such partition exists, it should print "NO".

### Implementation Analysis:
- `func_1` checks if a string is a palindrome.
- `func_2` processes the input string `s` and attempts to find a valid partition:
  - It first checks if the entire string `s` is not a palindrome using `func_1`. If true, it prints "YES" and the string itself as the single part.
  - If the entire string is a palindrome, it looks for the first character that is different from the first character (`s[0]`). This is stored in variable `x`.
  - If no such character is found (i.e., `x == -1`), it means the string is a palindrome, so it prints "NO".
  - If a different character is found at position `x`, it further checks if the substring starting from `x+1` is not a palindrome. If true, it prints "YES" and the two parts: `s[:x+1]` and `s[x+1:]`.
  - If the above condition fails, it further checks specific edge cases (like `x == 1` or `x == n // 2`) and prints "NO" if they hold.
  - Otherwise, it prints "YES" and the two parts: `s[:x+2]` and `s[x+2:]`.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic in `func_2` correctly identifies if the string can be split into non-palindromic parts.
- The handling of edge cases (like when the string is a single character or when `x` is at the midpoint) ensures that all possible scenarios are covered.
- The output format matches the problem statement requirements.

Given that `func_2` correctly implements the logic and handles all necessary cases, the program as a whole meets the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
