Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n (inclusive), and every second element in `a` is reversed.**

Explanation: The code `a[::2] = a[::2][::-1]` reverses every second element in the list `a`. This means that elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) are reversed. The other elements remain unchanged. Therefore, the list `a` now has its even-indexed elements reversed while the odd-indexed elements stay the same.
