Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
   - `a` is a list of integers from 1 to \(n\) (inclusive), and every second element in `a` is reversed.

2. **Understanding the List `a`:**
   - The list `a` starts with integers from 1 to \(n\).
   - Every second element in `a` is reversed. This means that the elements at even indices (2nd, 4th, 6th, etc.) are swapped with their corresponding elements from the end of the list.

For example, if \(n = 5\), the list `a` would initially be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. After reversing every second element, it becomes `[1, 5, 3, 2, 5]`.

3. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print(*a)`, which will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

Given the above understanding, let's describe the output:

- The list `a` will have the first element unchanged, followed by the last element, then the third element, followed by the second-to-last element, and so on.

Therefore, the output will be the elements of the list `a` printed in the order described.

Output: **1 5 3 2 5 ... (where the list continues with the pattern of alternating between the first half and the reversed second half of the list)**
