Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
- If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes the integer `n`.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed when the following statement is executed:

```python
print(len(ans))
```

To do this, let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: `0` is in `ans`**
   - In this case, `ans` will include the integer `n` in addition to any other elements it may have had.
   - Therefore, the length of `ans` will increase by 1 compared to its original length.

2. **Scenario 2: `0` is not in `ans`**
   - In this case, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - Therefore, the length of `ans` will remain the same as its original length.

Since the exact contents of `ans` are not specified in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact number of elements in `ans`. However, we can say that the length of `ans` will either increase by 1 or remain the same based on whether `0` was originally in `ans`.

Given this, the output will be the length of the set `ans` after considering the conditions mentioned.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the length of the set ans, which could be the original length or the original length plus one depending on whether 0 was originally in ans)**
