### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

#### Function Breakdown:
1. **func_1()**: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
2. **func_2()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
3. **func_3()**: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
4. **func_4()**: This is the main function that processes the input and computes the possible positions of the ball.

#### Function 4 Analysis:
- **Parameters**: The function takes `n`, `m`, `x`, and an initial set `ans` containing `x`.
- **Initialization**: The set `ans` is initialized with the starting player `x`.
- **Loop through throws**: The function iterates `m` times, processing each throw.
  - **Reading Input**: Each throw is read as a string, split into `r` (distance) and `c` (direction).
  - **Updating Set**: For each throw, the function updates the set `ans` based on the direction `c`:
    - If `c` is '0' or '?', the ball can be thrown clockwise, so `(q + r) % n` is added to `temp`.
    - If `c` is '1' or '?', the ball can be thrown counterclockwise, so `(q - r) % n` is added to `temp`.
  - **Set Update**: The temporary set `temp` is updated with all possible new positions.
- **Adjustment for Modulo**: If `0` is in `ans`, it is replaced with `n` to handle the wrap-around condition.
- **Output**: The size of the set `ans` and its elements are printed.

#### Correctness Verification:
1. **Direction Handling**: The function correctly handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws by checking the direction `c` and updating the set accordingly.
2. **Modulo Operation**: The use of `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` ensures that the ball's position wraps around correctly.
3. **Set Operations**: Using a set ensures that all unique possible positions are tracked without duplicates.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: The replacement of `0` with `n` handles the case where the ball could be passed back to the starting player.

Given the detailed analysis and the function summary, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function handles all possible scenarios and outputs the correct set of players who could have the ball after `m` throws.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the provided problem description and function summary.
