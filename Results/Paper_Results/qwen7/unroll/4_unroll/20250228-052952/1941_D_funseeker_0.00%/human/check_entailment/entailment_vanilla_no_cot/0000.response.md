Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the possible players who could have the ball after `m` throws. Here’s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the necessary inputs correctly using custom functions (`func_1`, `func_2`, `func_3`) which abstract reading a line, an integer, and a list of integers respectively.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting player `x`.

3. **Processing Throws**: For each throw, it processes the distance `r` and the direction `c`:
   - If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), it updates the set `ans` accordingly.
   - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it considers both possible directions.

4. **Adjusting for Zero-based Indexing**: The program ensures that the result modulo `n` handles the circular nature of the players’ positions correctly.

5. **Handling Edge Case**: It handles the edge case where the ball could be passed back to the starting position by adding `n` to the set if `0` is found in `ans`.

6. **Output**: Finally, it prints the number of possible players and their indices in sorted order.

Given the problem constraints and the provided example, the program accurately computes the possible players who could have the ball after the specified throws. Therefore, the program is correct.
