Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**: Reads a line from standard input and returns it after stripping any trailing whitespace. This function is correctly implemented and serves as a utility for reading input.
2. **Function `func_2`**: Reads an integer from standard input using `func_1()`. This function is also correctly implemented and serves to read the number of test cases.
3. **Function `func_3`**: Reads a line from standard input, splits it into space-separated values, and converts each value to an integer. This function is correctly implemented and serves to read the parameters `n`, `m`, and `x`.
4. **Function `func_4`**: This function is the core logic of the program. It correctly initializes the set of possible players with the starting player `x`. For each throw, it updates the set of possible players based on the distance `r` and the direction `c`. The logic handles both clockwise and counterclockwise throws appropriately, even when the direction is unknown (`?`). Finally, it adjusts the set if necessary and prints the results.

Given the execution summaries and the implementation details, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. It reads the input, processes each test case, and outputs the correct set of possible players who could have the ball after the specified throws.

Correctness: **True**
