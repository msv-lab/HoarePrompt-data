t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and x are integers such that 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. The list of moves consists of m tuples, where each tuple contains an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?'), representing the distance and the direction of the i-th throw, respectively.
