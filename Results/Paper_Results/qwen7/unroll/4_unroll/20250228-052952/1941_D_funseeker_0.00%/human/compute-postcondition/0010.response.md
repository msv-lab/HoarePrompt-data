Based on the initial state provided:

- `ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.
- If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` now includes the integer `n`.
- If `0` is not in `ans`, `ans` remains unchanged.

We need to determine what will be printed when the `print(*ans)` statement is executed.

To do this, we need to consider two cases:
1. If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` will include `n`.
2. If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `ans` and `n` are not provided, we can only describe the set `ans` in a general form based on the conditions given.

Output: **{integer elements of ans}** (where the set `ans` includes the integer `n` if `0` is in `ans`, otherwise it remains unchanged).
