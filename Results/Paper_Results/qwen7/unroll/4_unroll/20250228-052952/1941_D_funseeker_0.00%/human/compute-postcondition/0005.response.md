Output State: **`ans` is a set of integers representing the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws, excluding 0.**

Explanation: The code `ans.discard(0)` removes the integer `0` from the set `ans`. Since `ans` initially included `0` along with other possible positions of the ball, after executing this line, `0` is no longer part of the set `ans`. All other elements in `ans` remain unchanged.
