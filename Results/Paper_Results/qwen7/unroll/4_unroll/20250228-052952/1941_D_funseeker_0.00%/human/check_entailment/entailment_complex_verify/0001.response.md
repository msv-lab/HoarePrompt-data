### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves tracking the position of a ball thrown among `n` players in a circle. The ball can be thrown a certain distance either clockwise or counterclockwise, and we need to determine the possible positions of the ball after `m` throws.

2. **Function Definitions**:
   - `func_1()`: Reads a line from standard input and strips any trailing whitespace.
   - `func_2()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to an integer.
   - `func_3()`: Converts the result of `func_1()` to a list of integers.
   - `func_4()`: This function handles the main logic of the problem.

3. **Function 4 Analysis**:
   - **Initialization**: It initializes a set `ans` with the starting position `x`.
   - **Loop through Throws**: It iterates `m` times, where each iteration processes one throw.
     - **Reading Input**: It reads the distance `r` and direction `c` of the throw.
     - **Updating Possible Positions**:
       - If the direction is known (`'0'` for clockwise or `'1'` for counterclockwise), it updates the set `ans` accordingly.
       - If the direction is unknown (`'?'`), it updates the set `ans` for both possible directions.
   - **Adjustment for Zero Index**: After processing all throws, it adjusts the set `ans` to ensure that `0` is replaced with `n` if present.
   - **Output**: It prints the number of possible positions and the positions themselves in increasing order.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly handles both known and unknown directions.
   - The modulo operation ensures that positions wrap around correctly.
   - The final adjustment for `0` to `n` is correctly implemented.
   - The output format matches the required format.

However, there is a subtle issue with the implementation of the set `ans` and the handling of the direction `'?'`.

### Detailed Evaluation:

- **Handling Unknown Directions**:
  - When `c` is `'?'`, the code adds both `(q + r) % n` and `(q - r) % n` to the set `temp`. This is correct because `'?'` means the throw could be either clockwise or counterclockwise.
  
- **Set Operations**:
  - The set `ans` is updated in each iteration by replacing it with `temp`. This is correct because sets inherently handle duplicates and only keep unique elements.

- **Adjustment for Zero Index**:
  - The check `if (0 in ans): ans.discard(0); ans.add(n)` is intended to replace `0` with `n` if `0` is in `ans`. However, this check is unnecessary and can be removed. The modulo operation `% n` already ensures that the positions wrap around correctly, so `0` should never be in `ans` unless the ball starts at position `n` and all throws are counterclockwise, which is handled by the modulo operation.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment correctly identifies the main logic and the correctness of the implementation. However, the final adjustment for `0` to `n` is redundant and can be removed without affecting the correctness of the solution.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the final adjustment for `0` to `n` is unnecessary and does not affect the correctness.
