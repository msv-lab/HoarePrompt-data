Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the string has multiple segments of consecutive zeros or ones.

For example, consider the input string `010101`. The program will incorrectly output `1` because it counts the transitions between `0` and `1`, but the correct answer should be `3` since the string can be divided into three pieces: `0`, `10`, and `1`.

Another example is the string `00110011`. The program will again output `1`, but the correct answer should be `4` since the string can be divided into four pieces: `0`, `0`, `11`, and `011`.

These examples demonstrate that the program does not correctly determine the minimum number of pieces required for sorting the binary string. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
