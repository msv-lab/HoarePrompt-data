You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is reduced to 0, and for each input string `s` provided in the range of original `t`, the output is either `count + 1` if no two consecutive characters are equal and `flag` remains 0, or `count` if there exists at least one pair of consecutive characters where the second character is greater than the first, with `flag` set to 1.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads a binary string `s`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of cuts.
   - `flag` is initialized to 0. This flag will indicate whether there is a part of the string where the sequence of characters changes from non-decreasing order.

3. **Loop Through String**:
   - The program iterates through the string `s` using a loop from `0` to `len(s) - 2`.
   - For each pair of adjacent characters `(s[i], s[i+1])`, it checks if they are different (`int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1])`).
     - If they are different, it increments `count` by 1.
     - If the current character is less than the next character (`int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1])`), it sets `flag` to 1.

4. **Output Calculation**:
   - After the loop, if `flag` is 0, it means the entire string is already sorted (non-decreasing). In this case, the number of pieces needed is `count + 1`.
   - If `flag` is 1, it means there was at least one point where the sequence of characters changed, and the number of pieces needed is simply `count`.

### Testing with Examples

Let's test the program with the provided examples:

1. **Test Case: "11010"**
   - `count` will be incremented twice (at indices 2 and 3).
   - `flag` will be set to 1 because `1 < 0`.
   - Output: `count = 2`
   - Expected: `3` (Correct, as we need to split into three parts: "11", "0", "10").

2. **Test Case: "00000000"**
   - `count` will be 0.
   - `flag` will be 0 because the string is already sorted.
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1`
   - Expected: `1` (Correct).

3. **Test Case: "1"**
   - `count` will be 0.
   - `flag` will be 0 because the string is already sorted.
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1`
   - Expected: `1` (Correct).

4. **Test Case: "10"**
   - `count` will be 1.
   - `flag` will be 1 because `1 < 0`.
   - Output: `count = 1`
   - Expected: `2` (Incorrect, should be `2`).

5. **Test Case: "0001111"**
   - `count` will be 0.
   - `flag` will be 0 because the string is already sorted.
   - Output: `count + 1 = 1`
   - Expected: `1` (Correct).

6. **Test Case: "0110"**
   - `count` will be 2.
   - `flag` will be 1 because `0 < 1`.
   - Output: `count = 2`
   - Expected: `3` (Incorrect, should be `3`).

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly handle cases where the string needs to be split into more than one piece after encountering a change in the sequence. Specifically, it fails to account for the fact that a single change in sequence might require multiple cuts.

**Correctness: **False**
