### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i, j} \) can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \) using two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the entire \( i \)-th row.
     - Type 2: Permute the entire \( j \)-th column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \).
   - The solution prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - Two operations are performed for each row from \( n \) to 1:
     - A Type 1 operation to permute the row.
     - A Type 2 operation to permute the corresponding column.

3. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The provided sum formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \) does not represent the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum can be achieved by setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( i + j \), resulting in a sum of \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (i + j) \).
   - The operations are correctly described and executed. Each row and column is permuted in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with values from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - The solution ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

### Detailed Verification:
- **Sum Calculation:**
  - The correct maximum sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (i + j) \).
  - This can be simplified to \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( ni + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \right) \).
  - Simplifying further, we get \( n^2 + \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \cdot n = n^2 + \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^3 + n^2}{2} \).

- **Operations:**
  - The solution initializes the matrix such that each row is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to a unique value from 1 to \( n \).
  - The operations performed are:
    - Type 1: Permute the entire \( i \)-th row.
    - Type 2: Permute the entire \( j \)-th column.
  - These operations ensure that the matrix is filled with values from 1 to \( n \) in a way that maximizes the sum.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly initializes the matrix and performs the operations within the specified limit. However, the sum calculation is incorrect. The correct maximum sum is \( \frac{n^3 + n^2}{2} \), not \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
