### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling and Matrix Initialization:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It initializes the matrix `mat` with values from 1 to `n` for each row. This means that after initialization, the matrix looks like:
     ```
     [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
     [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
     ...
     [1, 2, 3, ..., n]
     ```

2. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The variable `res` is calculated as the sum of the series \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1)\). This series can be simplified to \(\frac{n(n^2 + 3n + 2)}{6}\), which is the sum of the first `n` odd numbers multiplied by their respective indices.
   - The value of `res` is then printed along with `2n`, which is the upper limit on the number of operations allowed.

3. **Operation Execution:**
   - For each row `i` from `n` to 1, the program performs two operations:
     - A Type 1 operation where the `i`-th row is set to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
     - A Type 2 operation where the `i`-th column is set to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   Let's verify if these operations achieve the desired result:
   - After the first operation (Type 1), the `i`-th row becomes `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - After the second operation (Type 2), the `i`-th column becomes `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

   Since both the rows and columns are set to the same sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`, the entire matrix will be filled with the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`. Therefore, the sum of the matrix will be:
   \[
   \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} a_{i,j} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \sum_{j=1}^{n} j \right) = n \cdot \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = \frac{n^2(n+1)}{2}
   \]

   This sum is indeed maximized because each element in the matrix is the maximum possible value (from 1 to `n`), and the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is used.

Given that the program correctly sets the matrix to maximize the sum and uses exactly `2n` operations (which is within the allowed limit), the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is correct according to the problem description and constraints.
