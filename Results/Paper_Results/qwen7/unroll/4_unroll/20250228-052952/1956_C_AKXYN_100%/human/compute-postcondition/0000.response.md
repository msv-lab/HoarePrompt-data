Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The key objects here are:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used to iterate over the range returned by `range(int(input()))`.
   - `int(input())`: This function call reads an integer from input and returns it.

2. **Determine the state adjustments needed**:
   - The variable `_` is just a placeholder and does not need adjustment since it is used internally by the loop.
   - The value of `int(input())` is what determines how many times the loop will run. Therefore, we need to ensure that this value is valid according to the given constraints.

3. **Constraints analysis**:
   - For each test case, `t` (which is the value of `int(input())`) is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - The sum of \(n^2\) over all test cases does not exceed \(5 \times 10^5\).

4. **Adjusting the state**:
   - Since the loop will run `t` times, `t` must be within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
   - We don't need to adjust the state of `n` or any other variables outside the loop head because they are not mentioned in the loop head.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t`, ensuring it is within the specified range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
