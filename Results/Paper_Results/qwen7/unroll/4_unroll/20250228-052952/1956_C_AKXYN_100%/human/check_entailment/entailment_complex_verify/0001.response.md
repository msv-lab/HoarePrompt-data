### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each element \( a_{i, j} \) can be set to any value from 1 to \( n \) using two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the entire \( i \)-th row.
     - Type 2: Permute the entire \( j \)-th column.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution:**
   - The solution initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of numbers from 1 to \( n \).
   - The sum of the matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \).
   - The solution prints the maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - Two operations are performed for each row from \( n \) to 1:
     - A Type 1 operation to permute the row.
     - A Type 2 operation to permute the corresponding column.

3. **Verification of the Solution:**
   - The sum calculation is incorrect. The provided sum formula \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \) does not represent the maximum possible sum of the matrix. The maximum sum is actually achieved by setting each element \( a_{i, j} \) to \( i + j \).
   - The operations are correctly described and executed. Each row and column is permuted in a way that ensures the matrix is filled with values from 1 to \( n \).

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The solution handles the edge case where \( n = 1 \) correctly.
   - The solution ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \( 2n \).

5. **Detailed Analysis Using Annotated Code:**
   - The matrix `mat` is initialized with rows being permutations of numbers from 1 to \( n \). This means each row is filled with values from 1 to \( n \) in some order.
   - The sum of the matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \), which is incorrect. The correct sum is \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (i + j) \).
   - The operations performed are:
     - For each row \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, a Type 1 operation is performed to permute the row.
     - For each column \( i \) from \( n \) to 1, a Type 2 operation is performed to permute the column.
   - These operations ensure that each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to a value from 1 to \( n \), but the sum is not maximized correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not correctly calculate the maximum sum of the matrix. The sum formula provided is incorrect, and the sum should be \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} (i + j) \).

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
