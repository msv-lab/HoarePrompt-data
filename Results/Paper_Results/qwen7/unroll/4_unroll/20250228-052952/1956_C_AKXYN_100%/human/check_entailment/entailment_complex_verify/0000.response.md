### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Matrix Initialization and Sum Calculation**:
   - The program initializes a matrix `mat` with values `[1, 2, ..., n]` for each row. This means the matrix is filled with a simple increasing sequence.
   - The sum `res` is calculated as \(\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1)\). This sum is derived from the formula for the sum of squares of the first \(n\) natural numbers, which is \(\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}\). However, the program calculates it differently, which is not relevant to the problem since the goal is to maximize the sum through operations, not to calculate the theoretical maximum sum directly.

2. **Operations**:
   - The program prints `n` lines for each test case, each starting with '1 n' followed by the sequence from 1 to n.
   - It then prints another `n` lines, each starting with '2 n' followed by the sequence from 1 to n.
   - These operations essentially set each row and each column of the matrix to the sequence from 1 to n.

3. **Effect of Operations**:
   - Each '1' operation sets the entire \(i\)-th row to the sequence from 1 to n.
   - Each '2' operation sets the entire \(i\)-th column to the sequence from 1 to n.
   - Since the matrix is \(n \times n\), performing these operations will result in every element in the matrix being set to some value from 1 to n.

4. **Maximizing the Sum**:
   - The operations described do indeed maximize the sum of the matrix because they ensure that every element in the matrix is set to the highest possible value (which is n) in the most efficient way possible.
   - Specifically, setting each row and each column to the sequence from 1 to n ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized to \(n^2\), which is the highest possible sum for an \(n \times n\) matrix filled with values from 1 to n.

Given this analysis, the program does correctly maximize the sum of the matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations, as required by the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was inaccurate. The program correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix using no more than \(2n\) operations.
