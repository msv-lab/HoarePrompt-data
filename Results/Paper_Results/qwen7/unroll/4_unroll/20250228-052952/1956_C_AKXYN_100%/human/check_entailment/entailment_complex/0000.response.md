Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of the matrix using at most 2n operations.
2. The annotated program suggests a straightforward approach:
   - For each test case, it initializes a matrix `mat` with values from 1 to n in each row.
   - It calculates the sum \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \) and prints this sum along with \( 2n \).
   - It then performs `n` Type 1 operations, each setting the entire row to the sequence from 1 to n.
   - It performs another `n` Type 2 operations, each setting the entire column to the sequence from 1 to n.
3. This approach ensures that each cell in the matrix ends up being set to a value from 1 to n exactly once, thereby achieving the maximum possible sum for the matrix.
4. The calculations and operations are correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the annotated program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
