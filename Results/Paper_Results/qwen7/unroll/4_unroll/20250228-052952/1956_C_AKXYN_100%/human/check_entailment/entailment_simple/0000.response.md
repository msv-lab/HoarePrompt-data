Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute rows or columns.
2. The given solution constructs the matrix `mat` such that each row and each column is a permutation of the sequence from 1 to \( n \). This ensures that the sum of the matrix is maximized because each element \( a_{i,j} \) will be the product of its row index and column index, which is already maximized by the construction.
3. The sum of the matrix is calculated as \( \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (i+1)(2i+1) \), which is derived from the fact that each row and column permutation contributes optimally to the sum.
4. The solution prints the sum and the number of operations, which is \( 2n \), as required. It then performs the operations in reverse order, first permuting the columns and then the rows, ensuring that the sum is maximized.
5. The constructed permutations in both steps are valid since they are simply the identity permutation, which is a valid permutation of the sequence from 1 to \( n \).

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to maximize the sum of the matrix and adheres to the constraints.
