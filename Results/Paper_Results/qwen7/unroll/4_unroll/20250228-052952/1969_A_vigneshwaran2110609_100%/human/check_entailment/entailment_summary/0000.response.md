Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Condition Check**: The program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` for each element in the list. This condition is checking if the best friend of the best friend of the i-th friend is the i-th friend itself, which is not what the problem requires. The problem states that if both the i-th friend and their best friend (p_i) receive an invitation, then the i-th friend will come to the party.

2. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program prints "2" if it finds any pair (i, p_i) where both i and p_i are invited, and "3" otherwise. However, this logic is flawed because:
   - It does not ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - It does not consider the possibility of inviting more friends to minimize the total number of invitations.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the first test case with input `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, the program should find that inviting friends 4 and 5 is sufficient, but it incorrectly prints "2".
   - For the second test case with input `[2, 3, 4, 1]`, the program should find that inviting friends 1, 2, and 3 is necessary, but it incorrectly prints "3".

To correctly solve the problem, we need to identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and invite them. If no such pairs exist, we need to invite additional friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party.

Correctness: **False**
