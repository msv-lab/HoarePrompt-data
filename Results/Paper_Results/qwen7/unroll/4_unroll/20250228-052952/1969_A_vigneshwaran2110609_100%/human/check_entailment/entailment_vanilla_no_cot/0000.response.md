Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's analyze why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program tries to check if `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` for each element in the list. This condition checks if the best friend of the i-th friend also has i+1 as their best friend, which is not necessary for the solution. The logic should be checking if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends.

2. **Output Logic**: The program prints `2` if it finds any pair where `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. However, this is not always correct. For instance, consider the input:
   ```
   5
   3 1 2 5 4
   ```
   Here, no pair satisfies `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`, but we can still invite friends 4 and 5, making the answer 2.

3. **Handling Cases**: The program incorrectly handles cases where no direct pairs exist. For example, in the input:
   ```
   4
   2 3 4 1
   ```
   The correct answer should be 3, but the program might incorrectly print 2.

### Correct Solution:
To correctly solve the problem, you need to identify cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle of length 2, you can invite both friends in the cycle. Otherwise, you need to invite at least three friends to ensure at least two come.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find cycles of length 2
        cycle_found = False
        for i in range(n):
            j = p[i] - 1
            while j != i:
                if p[j] - 1 == i:
                    print(2)
                    cycle_found = True
                    break
                j = p[j] - 1
            if cycle_found:
                break
        
        if not cycle_found:
            print(3)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution correctly identifies cycles of length 2 and prints 2 if such a cycle exists. If no such cycle exists, it prints 3, ensuring at least two friends come to the party.
