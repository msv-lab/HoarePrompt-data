Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a predefined range. It checks if the integer `t` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and for each test case, it verifies if the integer `n` is between 2 and 50 inclusive. Additionally, it ensures that `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `p_i` is between 1 and `n`, does not equal `i`, and all integers in the list are distinct. Based on these conditions, the function returns appropriate values or messages.**
