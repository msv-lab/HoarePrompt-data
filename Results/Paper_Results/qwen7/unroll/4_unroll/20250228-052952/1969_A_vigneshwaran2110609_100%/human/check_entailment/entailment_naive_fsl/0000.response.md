Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where no pair of friends can form a valid invitation pair. Specifically, the program assumes that there will always be at least one pair of friends who are each other's best friends and thus can form a valid invitation pair. However, this is not guaranteed according to the problem statement.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3
2 3 1
```
In this case, no two friends are each other's best friends. According to the problem description, Monocarp needs to send invitations to at least 3 friends to ensure at least 2 friends come to the party. However, the program incorrectly prints `2` in this scenario.

To fix this, the program should check if there is any pair of friends who are each other's best friends and handle the case where no such pair exists appropriately.
