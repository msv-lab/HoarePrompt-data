Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `l` is 0, `r` is the length of `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `l` and `r`. Variable `l` is set to 0, and variable `r` is set to the length of the list `arr`. The initial state of `arr` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r`, along with the unchanged list `arr`.
