Output State: The output state will consist of a series of pairs of integers printed based on the comparison in each iteration of the loop. For each pair (x, y) entered, if x > y, it prints (x, y); otherwise, it prints (y, x). The number of pairs printed will be equal to the value of `x`. Since the initial value of `t` is not affected by the loop, it remains unchanged at the end.
