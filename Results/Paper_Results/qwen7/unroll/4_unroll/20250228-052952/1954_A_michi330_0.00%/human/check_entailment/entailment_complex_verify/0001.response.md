### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Alice can paint each part of the ribbon with one of `m` colors.
   - Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to any color.
   - Alice wants to paint the ribbon so that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

2. **Key Conditions for "NO":**
   - If `n <= k`, Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color.
   - If `n - ceil(n/m) < k`, Bob can still repaint enough parts to make them the same color. Here, `ceil(n/m)` represents the minimum number of parts that must be painted the same color to ensure that the remaining parts are less than `k`.

3. **Key Conditions for "YES":**
   - If neither of the above conditions hold, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

4. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k`.
   - If either condition is true, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where `n <= k` and `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k` correctly.
   - It also covers the scenario where Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot achieve his goal.

6. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic in the code matches the problem statement.
   - The conditions for determining whether Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that Bob cannot make all parts the same color are correctly implemented.

However, upon closer inspection of the annotated code and the provided examples, we notice that the condition `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k` is not sufficient to determine when Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. 

For instance, consider the following test case:
- Input: `5 2 2`
- Output: `NO`

According to the problem statement, Alice can paint the ribbon as `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. In this case, Bob cannot repaint 2 parts to make all parts the same color because he can only repaint 2 parts, and the structure of the ribbon prevents him from doing so.

The condition `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k` does not account for the distribution of colors and the structure of the ribbon. Instead, it should check if the number of distinct colors exceeds the number of parts Bob can repaint plus one. This is because if there are more than `k + 1` distinct colors, Bob cannot make all parts the same color.

Therefore, the correct condition should be:
\[ \text{If } m > k + 1, \text{ then print 'YES'} \]

### Corrected Code:
```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if n <= k or m > k + 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

### Final Evaluation:
The original assessment was **inaccurate** because the condition `n - math.ceil(n/m) < k` is not sufficient to determine when Alice can prevent Bob from making all parts the same color. The corrected condition should be `m > k + 1`.

### Final Answer:
Final: **False**
