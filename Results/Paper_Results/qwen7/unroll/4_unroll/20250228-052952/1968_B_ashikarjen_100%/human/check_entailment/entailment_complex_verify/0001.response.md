### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process one test case at a time. It correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m`, and the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to traverse through string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in string `a`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b`.
   - If `b[j]` matches `a[i]`, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next potential match in `b`.
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output**: After processing all characters in `a`, it prints the value of `k`.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The main block of the script processes each test case using a loop that calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic inside `func_1()` correctly implements the requirement to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The implementation handles all edge cases, including when `a` is longer than `b`, and when there are no matching subsequences.
- The code adheres to the problem constraints and correctly outputs the expected results for the provided examples.

### Detailed Evaluation Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `t` is read and represents the number of test cases.
  - For each test case, `n` and `m` are read, representing the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
  - Strings `a` and `b` are read.
  - Variables `k` and `j` are initialized to 0.

- **Loop Through String `a`**:
  - The outer loop iterates over each character in `a`.
  - The inner `while` loop finds the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b`.
  - If a match is found, `k` is incremented, and `j` is moved to the next character in `b`.
  - If no match is found, the loop breaks, and the process moves to the next character in `a`.

- **Output**:
  - After the loop completes, the value of `k` is printed, which represents the length of the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

- **Edge Cases**:
  - If `a` is longer than `b`, the loop will eventually break when `j` reaches `m`.
  - If no characters in `a` match any characters in `b`, `k` remains 0.

The given program correctly solves the problem as described. The logic is sound, and it handles all edge cases appropriately.
