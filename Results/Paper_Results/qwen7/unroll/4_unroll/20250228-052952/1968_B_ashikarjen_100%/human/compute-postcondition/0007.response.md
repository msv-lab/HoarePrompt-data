Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `m` is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is an integer representing the number of times `a[i]` matched `b[j]` before `j` reached `m` or the end of the loop, `j` is an integer representing the position in string `b` where the loop last attempted to find a match for `a[i]`.
