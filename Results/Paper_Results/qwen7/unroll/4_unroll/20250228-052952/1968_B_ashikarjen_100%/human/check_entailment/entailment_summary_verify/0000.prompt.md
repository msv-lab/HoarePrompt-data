You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

    a = input()
    b = input()

    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return



- Function Summary: 
The function reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), followed by two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then compares each character of \( a \) with \( b \) up to the length of \( b \), counting the number of matches. Finally, it prints the count of matches and returns None.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the prefix of string `a` of length `k` is a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the program increments `k` only when it finds a matching character in `b`, but it does not ensure that the characters in `a` are checked in order. This means that the program might increment `k` multiple times for the same character in `b`, which is incorrect.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3 4
101
1101
```

The expected output should be `2` because the prefix "10" of string `a` is a subsequence of string `b`. However, the program will incorrectly output `3` because it increments `k` twice for the character '1' in `b`.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that it checks the characters of `a` in order and only increments `k` once per character in `a` when a match is found in `b`. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        k = 0
        j = 0
        for i in range(n):
            while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
                j += 1
            if j < m:
                k += 1
                j += 1
            else:
                break
        print(k)
```

This corrected version ensures that `k` is incremented only once per character in `a` when a match is found in `b`, maintaining the correct order and ensuring the maximum prefix length is calculated accurately.
