### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1()` is defined to process one test case at a time. It correctly reads the lengths `n` and `m`, and the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Variable Initialization**: 
   - `k` is initialized to 0, which will store the length of the prefix of `a` that forms a subsequence of `b`.
   - `j` is initialized to 0, which will be used to traverse through string `b`.

3. **Loop Through String `a`**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in string `a`.
   - For each character `a[i]`, it uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in string `b`.
   - If `b[j]` matches `a[i]`, it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next potential match in `b`.
   - If no match is found (`j >= m`), the loop breaks, indicating that the remaining part of `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output**: After processing all characters in `a`, it prints the value of `k`.

5. **Test Case Handling**: The main block of the script processes each test case using a loop that calls `func_1()` for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic inside `func_1()` correctly implements the requirement to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The implementation handles all edge cases, including when `a` is longer than `b`, and when there are no matching subsequences.
- The code adheres to the problem constraints and correctly outputs the expected results for the provided examples.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly solves the problem as described.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
