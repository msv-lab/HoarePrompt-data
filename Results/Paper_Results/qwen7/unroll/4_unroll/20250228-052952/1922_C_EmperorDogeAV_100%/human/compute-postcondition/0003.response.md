Output State: `cities` is a list of n integers representing the coordinates of n cities on a number line in strictly increasing order, and `prog_cities` is a list of length n-1 where each element is either 1 or the absolute difference between the city at position i+1 and the city at position i. If the next city is closer than the previous city, the corresponding element in `prog_cities` is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to the absolute difference between the next and current city.
