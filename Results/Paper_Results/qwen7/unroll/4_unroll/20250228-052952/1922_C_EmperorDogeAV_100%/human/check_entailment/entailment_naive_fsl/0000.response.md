Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic for finding the closest city to a given city. Specifically, the `func_1` function is not correctly identifying the closest city for each city in the list. Instead of finding the closest city, it seems to be calculating some kind of difference or distance without properly identifying the closest city.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
0 8 12 15 20
5
1 4
1 5
3 4
3 2
5 1
```

The expected output based on the problem description should be:
```
3
8
1
4
14
```

However, running the provided program will not produce these results because `func_1` does not correctly identify the closest city for each city. This can be verified by manually checking the logic in `func_1` and comparing it to the expected behavior described in the problem statement.
