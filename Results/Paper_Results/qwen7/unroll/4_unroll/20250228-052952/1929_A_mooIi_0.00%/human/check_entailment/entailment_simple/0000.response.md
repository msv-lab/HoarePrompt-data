Reasoning:
The provided function does not actually compute the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. Instead, it sorts the array and prints the sorted version of the array. This does not address the requirement to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to rearrange the array elements to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements. One optimal strategy is to sort the array in ascending order and place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end, then calculate the beauty as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided function simply sorts the array and prints it without performing the necessary calculations to find the maximum beauty. Therefore, the given function does not meet the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **False**
