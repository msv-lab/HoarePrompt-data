Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the values `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for `i` from `2` to `n`. However, the given program simply sorts the array and prints it, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty as defined.

To maximize the beauty, we should place the smallest element at the beginning and the largest element at the end of the array after sorting, then alternate placing the next smallest and next largest elements. This way, the differences between consecutive elements will be maximized.
