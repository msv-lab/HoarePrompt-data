You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each containing an array of integers. For each test case, it reads the number of integers `n`, then reads `n` integers from the input, sorts them, converts each integer to a string, and prints them space-separated on a new line. After processing all test cases, the function concludes with the output consisting of sorted arrays from each test case, each on a new line and integers within each array as strings.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. Specifically, we want to maximize the expression:
\[ \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

### Given Program
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = map(str, sorted(list(map(int, input().split()))))
        print(' '.join(ar))
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array elements.

2. **Sorting the Array**:
   - The program sorts the array `ar` in ascending order using `sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))`.
   - It then converts the sorted list of integers to a list of strings using `map(str, ...)`.

3. **Output**:
   - The program prints the sorted array as a string of space-separated values using `' '.join(ar)`.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Incorrect Approach**:
   - The program sorts the array in ascending order and prints it. However, sorting does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array.
   - To maximize the beauty, we should aim to maximize the positive differences \(a_i - a_{i-1}\). This means we should place the largest element at one end and the smallest at the other end, alternating between the largest and smallest remaining elements.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the example input `[2, 1, 3]`, the program would sort it to `[1, 2, 3]` and output `1 2 3`. The beauty would be calculated as \((2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2\), which is correct.
   - However, for the input `[100, 54, 80, 43, 90]`, the program would sort it to `[43, 54, 80, 90, 100]` and output `43 54 80 90 100`. The beauty would be calculated as \((54 - 43) + (80 - 54) + (90 - 80) + (100 - 90) = 114\), but the optimal arrangement would be `[100, 43, 90, 54, 80]` to get \((43 - 100) + (90 - 43) + (54 - 90) + (80 - 54) = -57 + 47 - 36 + 26 = -20\).

### Conclusion
The given program does not solve the problem correctly because it simply sorts the array, which does not guarantee the maximum beauty. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
