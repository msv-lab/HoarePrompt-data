Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, which is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. However, the program simply sorts the array and prints the elements as strings, which does not achieve the objective of maximizing the beauty.

To maximize the beauty, we should arrange the elements such that the positive differences between consecutive elements are maximized while minimizing the negative differences. This can be achieved by sorting the array in ascending order and then placing the smallest element at the beginning and the largest at the end, ensuring the differences are as large as possible.

The given program does not perform this rearrangement; instead, it sorts the array and prints the elements directly, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty.

Correctness: **False**
