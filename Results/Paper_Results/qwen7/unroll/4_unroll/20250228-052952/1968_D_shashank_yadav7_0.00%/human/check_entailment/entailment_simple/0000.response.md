### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given code step-by-step to ensure it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

1. **Input Reading and Initialization:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S`, and initializes the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The code adjusts `b` and `s` to zero-based indices by subtracting 1, which is correct since Python uses zero-based indexing.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` (for Sasha) and `bp` (for Bodya) are calculated correctly as the value of `a` at the starting positions.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - The code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum possible scores for both players over `k` turns.
   - For each turn, it updates the positions of both players and recalculates their scores based on the maximum possible score they could achieve from their new positions.
   - This ensures that both players are considering the best possible moves to maximize their scores.

5. **Final Comparison and Output:**
   - After calculating the maximum possible scores, the code compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner or if it's a draw.

Given the detailed analysis, the code appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The dynamic programming approach ensures that both players are considering the best possible moves at each turn, and the final comparison of scores accurately determines the winner.

### Conclusion:

The given code is correct and follows the problem statement accurately.

**Correctness: **True**
