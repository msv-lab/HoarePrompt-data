### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the key steps and logic in the program. Let's break down the verification process again to ensure accuracy:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (starting positions for Bodya and Sasha).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The program correctly adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `bm` and `sm` are initially set to `a[b] * k` and `a[s] * k` respectively. This is because the maximum score for a player after `k` turns is achieved by moving to the best possible position each turn.

4. **Simulating Game Turns:**
   - The program enters a loop that simulates the game turns.
   - In each iteration, it updates the positions of Bodya and Sasha to their next positions using the permutation `p`.
   - It then updates the scores `bm` and `sm` by adding the maximum of the current score plus the new position value or the previous maximum score.
   - The loop breaks when `k` turns are completed.

5. **Determining the Winner:**
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm` is greater than `sm`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `bm` is less than `sm`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `bm` equals `sm`, it prints "Draw".

### Detailed Verification

To verify the logic, let's consider a few more examples and edge cases:

#### Example 3:
- Testcase: `4 2 1 4`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 1, Sasha at 4.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 4.
  - Sasha at 4 → Score = 6, Moves to 3.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 4 → Score = 13, Moves to 3.
  - Sasha at 3 → Score = 11, Moves to 2.
- Final scores: Bodya = 13, Sasha = 11. Bodya wins.

#### Example 4:
- Testcase: `4 2 4 1`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Sasha
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 4, Sasha at 1.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 4 → Score = 6, Moves to 3.
  - Sasha at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 2.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 3 → Score = 11, Moves to 2.
  - Sasha at 2 → Score = 12, Moves to 1.
- Final scores: Bodya = 11, Sasha = 12. Sasha wins.

#### Example 5:
- Testcase: `4 2 2 2`
- Permutation: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`
- Array: `[7, 2, 5, 6]`

**Expected Output:**
```
Draw
```

**Explanation:**
- Initial positions: Bodya at 2, Sasha at 2.
- Turn 1:
  - Bodya at 2 → Score = 2, Moves to 1.
  - Sasha at 2 → Score = 2, Moves to 1.
- Turn 2:
  - Bodya at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 4.
  - Sasha at 1 → Score = 7, Moves to 4.
- Final scores: Bodya = 7, Sasha = 7. Draw.

### Conclusion

After verifying the logic with various examples and edge cases, the program appears to handle the game simulation correctly. The logic follows the rules of the game and ensures that the maximum possible scores are calculated accurately.
