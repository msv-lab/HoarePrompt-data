The function processes input data for up to 1000 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', then counts the number of cells with coins ('@'). The function prints the count for each test case and resets the count to 0 after processing each string. The final output consists of the count of cells with coins for each test case.
