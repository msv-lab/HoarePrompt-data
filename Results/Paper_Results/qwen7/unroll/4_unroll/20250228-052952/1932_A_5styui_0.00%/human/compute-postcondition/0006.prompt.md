You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50, and the second line of input is a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*' where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. Additionally, the first cell is guaranteed to be empty ('.')
def func():
    a = int(input())
    s = 0
    for i in range(a):
        d = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        for j in range(len(b)):
            if b[j] == '@':
                s = s + 1
            elif b[j] == '*':
                if b[:]:
                    break
                elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                    break
        
        print(s)
        
        s = 0
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer, `s` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop processes each character of the string `b` for each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `i`). If a character `@` is found, `s` is incremented. If a character `*` is found, the inner loop breaks without further processing. After processing each string `b`, `s` is printed and reset to 0 for the next iteration. Since `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, the final value of `s` will always be 0 regardless of the input strings `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data for t test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', then returns the count of cells with coins ('@') for each test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
