Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the floor division of each count by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the modulo 2 values of these counts equals 3. The function outputs this calculated value for each test case.**
