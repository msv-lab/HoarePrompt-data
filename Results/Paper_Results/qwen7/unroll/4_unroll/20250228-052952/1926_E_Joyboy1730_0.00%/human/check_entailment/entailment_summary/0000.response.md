Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Initialization and Loop Logic**: The program initializes `L` but never appends any values to it. Instead, it uses a loop to decrement `n` by `m`, where `m = (n + 1) // 2`. This loop does not serve the purpose of generating the sequence of cards as described in the problem statement.

2. **Calculation of Card Positions**: The program attempts to calculate the position of the k-th card using the list `L`, which is never populated with the correct values. The logic inside the `for` loop that iterates over `L` is also incorrect and does not reflect the described process of laying down cards.

3. **Output Calculation**: The output calculation `print(pow * (2 * k - 1))` is based on assumptions about `L` and `tot` that are not correctly initialized or updated. This line of code does not correctly determine the k-th card according to the rules specified in the problem.

Given these issues, the program does not follow the correct logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav. Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
