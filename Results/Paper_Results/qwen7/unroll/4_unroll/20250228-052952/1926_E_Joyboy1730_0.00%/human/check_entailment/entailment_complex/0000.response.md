Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The line `m = (n + 1) // 2; n -= m` is used to reduce `n` by half, but this does not align with the problem's requirements. The problem requires laying out cards based on multiples of odd numbers, not simply halving `n`.

2. **Incorrect Use of List `L`**: The list `L` is never populated, and its usage in the subsequent loop is incorrect. The problem does not require storing the counts of cards laid down in a list.

3. **Incorrect Logic for Determining the k-th Card**: The loop that uses `pow`, `tot`, and `a` does not correctly simulate the process of laying down cards according to the problem's rules. Specifically, it incorrectly reduces `k` and calculates the card positions without properly accounting for the sequence of cards laid down.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to determine the k-th card laid down by Vladislav.

Correctness: **False**
