Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes test cases where each case includes integers t, n, and k. It returns a value based on the conditions: 1 ≤ t ≤ 5 ⋅ 10^4, and for each test case, 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 10^9.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing three integers (t, n, k) with specific constraints. The function does not explicitly accept these parameters but uses them within its logic to produce an output based on the given conditions.
