Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Odd Multipliers**: The program does not correctly calculate the number of cards that are multiples of odd numbers. Specifically, the loop `while n:` is not used to populate the list `L` with the correct counts of cards that are multiples of odd numbers.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding the k-th Card**: The logic inside the `for a in L:` loop is flawed. It does not properly handle the counting and printing of the k-th card based on the sequence described in the problem statement.

3. **Missing Initialization and Logic to Populate `L`**: The list `L` is never populated with the correct counts of cards that are multiples of odd numbers. This means the subsequent logic to find the k-th card is based on an empty or incorrectly populated list.

### Correct Solution:
Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Calculate the k-th card using the described sequence
        i = 1
        while True:
            count = (n + 1) // (2 * i)
            if k <= count * i:
                break
            k -= count * i
            i += 1
        
        # Determine the actual card number
        card_number = (2 * k - 1) * i
        print(card_number)

func()
```

This solution correctly calculates the k-th card by iterating through the sequence of odd multipliers and adjusting the count and position accordingly.
