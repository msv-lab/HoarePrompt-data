Output State: The total cost calculated for each test case based on the given conditions, printed for each iteration of the loop. If the usual price of a bun (a) is greater than or equal to the modified price of the first bun (b), the total cost is simply the usual price multiplied by the number of buns (n). Otherwise, the total cost is calculated using the formula involving the modified price, the difference between the usual and modified prices, and the number of buns.
