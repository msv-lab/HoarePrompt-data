Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `_`, which is a placeholder typically used when the loop variable itself is not needed. However, the value of `t` determines whether the loop will execute.

2. **Determine the Initial State**: The initial state before the loop is that `t` is an input integer. This means `t` could be any non-negative integer.

3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the State**: To ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` must be greater than 0.

**State:**
**`t` must be greater than 0**
