Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `m` (with constraints 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^6). It calculates the value of `ans` as `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`, where `i` ranges from 2 to the square root of `n`. Finally, it prints the calculated value of `ans` for each test case.**
