Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program does not correctly implement the problem statement. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). However, the provided code does not account for the condition involving the greatest common divisor (\(\gcd(a, b)\)).

The function `func_1` calculates the number of valid pairs based on a different logic that doesn't involve checking the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

To fix this, you would need to modify the logic to properly check the condition for each pair \((a, b)\) within the given ranges. Here's an outline of how you might approach it:

1. Iterate over all possible values of \(a\) from 1 to \(n\).
2. For each value of \(a\), iterate over all possible values of \(b\) from 1 to \(m\).
3. Check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
4. Count the number of pairs that satisfy this condition.

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This code correctly implements the logic required by the problem statement and should produce the correct output for the given test cases.
