### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the problem description.

#### Problem Description Recap:
We need to find the number of ordered pairs \((a, b)\) such that:
1. \(1 \le a \le n\),
2. \(1 \le b \le m\),
3. \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

#### Given Program:
```python
import math

"""
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**
*                      BISMILLAHIR RAHMANIR RAHEEM                         *                                                    *
**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"""
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    ans = n
    root = int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1
    for i in range(2, root + 1):
        cnt = i * i
        ans += (n + i) // cnt
    print(ans)
```

#### Annotated Code Analysis:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is read from input, representing the number of test cases.
   - A loop runs `t` times, calling `func_1()` for each test case.
   
2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - `n` and `k` are read from input, but `k` is never used in the function.
   - `ans` is initialized to `n`.
   - `root` is set to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`.
   - A loop runs from `2` to `root + 1`:
     - `cnt` is set to `i * i`.
     - `ans` is updated by adding `(n + i) // cnt` to itself.
   - The result is printed.

#### Key Points to Check:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `2` to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`. This does not cover all possible values of `a` and `b` up to `n` and `m`.
2. **GCD and Multiple Condition**: The program does not check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. **Usage of Variables**: The variable `k` is not used in the function, and the logic does not involve `m`.

#### Example Analysis:
Consider the input:
```
2
2 3
```
- For \(n = 2\) and \(m = 3\):
  - The correct pairs are \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\).
  - The program calculates `ans` as `2 + (2 + 2) // 4 + (2 + 3) // 9 = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3`.
  - The output is `3`, which is incorrect because it does not account for the gcd condition and the multiple condition.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not check the gcd condition or the multiple condition, and the logic inside the loop is unrelated to the problem requirements.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
