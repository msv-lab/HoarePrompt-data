### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies that the given program does not implement the logic required to solve the problem. Let's break down the issues and verify the solution step-by-step:

1. **Function Definition and Usage**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined but is never called with the correct parameters. It expects two arguments `n` and `k`, but these are not used in the problem statement. The main loop reads input and calls `func_1()`, but it should call a function that takes `n` and `m` as parameters.

2. **Incorrect Logic**:
   - The program attempts to count the number of valid pairs using a square root-based approach, which is not relevant to the problem. This approach does not consider the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

3. **Missing Calculation**:
   - The program does not perform the necessary calculations to check if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it simply counts some values without considering the actual constraints.

### Correct Approach
To solve this problem correctly, we need to iterate over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and check if they satisfy the given condition. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

### Annotated Code Analysis
Let's use the provided annotations to validate the original assessment:

- **Initial State**: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
- **Function `func_1()`**:
  - The function `func_1()` is defined but never called with the correct parameters. It expects `n` and `k`, but these are not used in the problem statement.
  - The function calculates `ans` as `n + sum((n + i) // (i * i) for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1))`, which is not relevant to the problem.
  - The function prints `ans`, which is not the correct output format.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect.
