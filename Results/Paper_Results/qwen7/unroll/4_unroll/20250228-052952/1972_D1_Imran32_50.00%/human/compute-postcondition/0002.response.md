Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^6, `ans` is equal to `n`, `root` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`**.

This means that the value of `t` remains unchanged, `n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `ans` remains equal to `n`, and `root` is calculated as the integer part of the square root of `n` plus one.
