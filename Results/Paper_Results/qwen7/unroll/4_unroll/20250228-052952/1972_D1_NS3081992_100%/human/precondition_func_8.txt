There is no input parameter for the function, and it is expected to handle multiple test cases as described in the problem statement. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, where 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6, and the sum of n or m over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function should read the number of test cases from standard input, followed by the values of n and m for each test case, and print the number of valid pairs for each test case.
