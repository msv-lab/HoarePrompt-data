The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `extroverts` and `universals`. Both `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers representing the number of extroverts and universals, respectively. 

- In Case_1, the function returns `None`.
- In Case_2, the function returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3, provided that `extroverts` modulo 3 is not equal to 0 and `(extroverts % 3 + universals)` is greater than or equal to 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `extroverts` and `universals`. It returns `None` in the first scenario and the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3 in the second scenario under specified conditions.
