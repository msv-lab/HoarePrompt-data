Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function checks if the number of extroverts (`extroverts`) is not divisible by 3.
   - If `extroverts % 3 != 0`, it further checks if `(extroverts % 3 + universals) >= 3`. If this condition is met, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
   - If `extroverts % 3 == 0`, it directly returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function calls `func_1(extroverts, universals)` and stores the result in `ret`.
   - If `ret` is `None`, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the sum of `introverts` and `ret`.

3. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program processes a predefined set of test cases, splitting each line into `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`, and then prints the result of calling `func_2` for these values.
   - The logic in `func_2` correctly handles the cases where it's possible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences and returns `-1` when it's not possible.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - The function correctly handles cases where the number of extroverts is not divisible by 3 and ensures that there are enough universals to make up the difference.
   - The function also correctly returns `-1` when it's impossible to accommodate the extroverts with the available universals.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of tents required or returns `-1` if it's impossible to accommodate the participants according to their preferences.

Correctness: **True**
