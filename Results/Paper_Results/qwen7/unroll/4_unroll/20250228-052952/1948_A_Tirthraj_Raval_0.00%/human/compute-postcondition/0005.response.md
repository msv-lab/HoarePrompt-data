Functionality: **The function processes up to 50 test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). If n is odd, it prints 'NO'. If n is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a string of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters repeated n//2 times. After processing all test cases, it ends without returning any value.**
