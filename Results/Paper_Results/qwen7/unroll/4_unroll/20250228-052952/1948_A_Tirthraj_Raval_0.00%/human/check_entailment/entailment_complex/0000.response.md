Reasoning:
1. The problem requires generating a string with exactly `n` special characters where a special character is defined as one that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.
2. The provided solution correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by printing 'NO', as it is impossible to have exactly `n` special characters when `n` is odd.
3. For even `n`, the solution generates a pattern of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters repeated `n // 2` times. This pattern ensures that every character except the first and last will be a special character because they will be different from exactly one neighbor. The first and last characters will also be special if `n > 2` because they will be different from their single neighbor.
4. The generated string will always be of length `n` and will satisfy the condition of having exactly `n` special characters, as required.
5. The solution handles up to 50 test cases, which is within the specified limit.

Given these points, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
