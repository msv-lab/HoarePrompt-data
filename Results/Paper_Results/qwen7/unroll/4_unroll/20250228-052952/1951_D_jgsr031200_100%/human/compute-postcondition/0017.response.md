Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Evaluate `n // (n - k + 1)` when `n` is 0:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `n - k + 1` would be `-k + 1`.
   - The floor division `0 // (-k + 1)` results in `0` because any non-zero number divided into 0 results in 0.

3. **Evaluate `n // 1`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, `0 // 1` also results in `0`.

4. **Calculate `h`:**
   - `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

5. **Check the condition `h < k`:**
   - Given that `h` is 0, and it is stated that `h` is less than `k`, this condition holds true regardless of the value of `k` (as long as `k` is greater than 0).

6. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the above steps, the print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **NO**
