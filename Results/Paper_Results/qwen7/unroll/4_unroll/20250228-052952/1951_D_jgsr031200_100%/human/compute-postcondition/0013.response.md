Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in costs:`. The objects involved here are `i` and `costs`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i`: This variable will take on the values from the list `costs` during each iteration of the loop.
   - `costs`: This is a list containing two elements: the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `costs`. Therefore, the list `costs` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `i` will take on the values from `costs`, the list `costs` must have at least one element for the loop to start executing. Given that `costs` contains exactly two elements (`n - k + 1` and `1`), the loop will always execute at least once.
   - No adjustments are needed for `i` since it will simply iterate over the existing elements in `costs`.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `costs`, ensuring it has at least one element (which it already does).

**Final State**:
State: **`h` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `costs` is a list containing two elements, the first element is `n - k + 1` and the second element is `1`**.

Since the list `costs` already has the required elements, no further adjustments are necessary.
