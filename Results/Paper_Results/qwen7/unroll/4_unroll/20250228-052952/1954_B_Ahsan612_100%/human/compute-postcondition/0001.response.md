Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. After executing the loop, the variable minn contains the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the array a, or -1 if no such segment exists. The variable same keeps track of the current length of consecutive identical numbers, and num stores the current number being checked. The variable i is the index used for iterating through the array a.
