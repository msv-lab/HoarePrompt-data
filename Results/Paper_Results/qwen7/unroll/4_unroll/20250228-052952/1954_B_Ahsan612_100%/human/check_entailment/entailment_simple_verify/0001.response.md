### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array so that it stops being beautiful. A beautiful array can be modified by replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) if \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The code iterates through the array and tries to find the minimum length of contiguous subarrays where all elements are the same.
   - The variable `same` keeps track of the current length of such a subarray.
   - The variable `num` stores the current value of the subarray.
   - The variable `minn` stores the minimum length of such subarrays found so far.
   - The code increments `i` twice when switching to a new subarray, which indeed skips over elements and may miss some valid subarrays.
   - The `minn` variable is updated only when a different element is encountered, but this does not account for the possibility of multiple valid subarrays within the same segment.

3. **Correctness of the Provided Solution**:
   - The logic for finding these contiguous subarrays is flawed because it skips elements and does not correctly track the necessary removals to break the beauty condition of the array.
   - The solution does not handle the requirement of making the array non-beautiful effectively.
   - The logic fails to correctly identify the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition of the array.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the provided solution. The code indeed skips elements and does not properly track the necessary removals to break the beauty condition of the array.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided solution is incorrect due to the flaws identified.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
