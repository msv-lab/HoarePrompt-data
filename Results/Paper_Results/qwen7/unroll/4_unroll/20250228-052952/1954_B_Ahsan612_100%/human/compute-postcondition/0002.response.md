Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n. The variable `minn` is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If there are no such segments or the array is uniform, `minn` is set to -1. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
