Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
3. It initializes variables to track the current sequence of the same element (`same`), the current element (`num`), and the minimum length of sequences of the same element (`minn`).
4. The while loop iterates through the array to find the minimum length of sequences of the same element.
5. After the loop, it checks if `minn` is infinity or equal to the length of the array, which would mean the array cannot be made non-beautiful by removing elements.
6. If the array can be made non-beautiful, it prints the minimum number of elements to remove, otherwise, it prints `-1`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic implemented in the function `func()` matches the requirements and constraints specified. The program correctly identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful, or outputs `-1` if it is impossible.

Correctness: **True**
