The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then finds the minimum length of any segment in the list where the elements are the same. If no such segment exists or the list is uniform, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the length of the shortest such segment.
