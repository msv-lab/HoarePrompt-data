You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have an array a of n integers.

You can no more than once apply the following operation: select three integers
i , j , x (1 \le i \le j \le n ) and assign all elements of the array with
indexes from i to j the value x . The price of this operation depends on the
selected indices and is equal to (j - i + 1) burles.

For example, the array is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1] . If we choose i = 2, j
= 4, x = 8 , then after applying this operation, the array will be equal to
[1, 8, 8, 8, 5, 1] .

What is the least amount of burles you need to spend to make all the elements
of the array equal?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10 ^ 5 ) — the size of the array.

The second line of the description of each test case contains n integers a_1,
a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) — array elements.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the minimum number of burles that
will have to be spent to make all the elements of the array equal. It can be
shown that this can always be done.

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        le = len(a)
        (l, r) = (0, n - 1)
        (st, end) = (1, 1)
        while l < r and a[l] == a[l + 1]:
            l += 1
            st += 1
        while r > l and a[r] == a[r - 1]:
            r -= 1
            end += 1
        ans = le - max(st, end)
        if a[0] == a[-1]:
            ans = max(0, le - (st + end))
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers \( a \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on specific conditions involving the lengths of consecutive identical elements at the beginning and end of the list \( a \). Specifically, it determines the maximum length of consecutive identical elements at the start and end of the list, subtracts this maximum from the total length of the list, and adjusts the result if the first and last elements of the list are identical.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation needs to be performed across different segments of the array.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4
4
1 2 3 1
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `4`. Here's why:

- We can change the subarray `[1, 2, 3]` to `1` with an operation cost of `3`.
- Alternatively, we can change the subarray `[2, 3, 1]` to `2` with an operation cost of `3`.
- Finally, we can change the last element `1` to match the rest of the array with an additional operation cost of `1`.

Thus, the total cost should be `4`, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible segments and their costs, and then find the minimum cost among them. This involves more complex logic than what is currently implemented.
