Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable mentioned here is `_`, which is used as a placeholder for the loop index. However, since `_` is typically used as a throwaway variable (not used in the loop body), we don't need to consider it for adjusting the state.

2. **Determine what needs to be adjusted**: The loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`. This means we need to ensure that the input provided is valid and non-zero, as the loop will run for each positive integer input.

3. **Consider the constraints**: The problem states that for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Formulate the adjusted state**: Since the loop will execute based on the input value, we need to ensure that the input is a positive integer. Therefore, the state should reflect that the input provided will be a positive integer.

Given these considerations, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **input() must return a positive integer**
