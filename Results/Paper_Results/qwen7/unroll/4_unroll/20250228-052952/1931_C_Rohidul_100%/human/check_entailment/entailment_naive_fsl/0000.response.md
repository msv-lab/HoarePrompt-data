Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program does not account for the scenario where the array has multiple distinct values and the optimal operation needs to be performed across different segments of the array.

For instance, consider the following input:

```
4
4
1 2 3 1
```

The program will output `2`, but the correct answer should be `4`. Here's why:

- We can change the subarray `[1, 2, 3]` to `1` with an operation cost of `3`.
- Alternatively, we can change the subarray `[2, 3, 1]` to `2` with an operation cost of `3`.
- Finally, we can change the last element `1` to match the rest of the array with an additional operation cost of `1`.

Thus, the total cost should be `4`, but the program incorrectly calculates the cost as `2`.

To fix this, the program needs to consider all possible segments and their costs, and then find the minimum cost among them. This involves more complex logic than what is currently implemented.
