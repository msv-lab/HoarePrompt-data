Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The only variable in the loop head is `p`.

2. **Condition for the Loop**: The loop condition is `p <= num`.

3. **Current State Before the Loop**:
   - `num` is a non-negative integer.
   - `p` is initially set to 2.

4. **Determine the Adjustment Needed**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `p <= num` must be true.
   - Given that `p` is initially set to 2, the loop will execute as long as `2 <= num`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `num` is a non-negative integer, and `p` is set to 2, the loop will definitely execute the first time if `num` is at least 2. However, since the problem does not specify any constraints on `num` other than it being a non-negative integer, we cannot make any further adjustments to `num` based on the given information.

Therefore, no additional adjustments are needed for the loop to execute the first time.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `p` is 2**
