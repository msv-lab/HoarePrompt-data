The function accepts three parameters: `n` (representing the number of sides of a polygon), `m` (representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen), and `v` (a list of `m` distinct integers representing the vertices Bessie has chosen). After execution, it returns a 2D list where each row contains the same `m` integers from the list `v`, repeated `n` times.
