Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where the first two elements (index 0 and index 1) are set to False, and all other elements are set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to 0; `p` is 2.**

Explanation: The variable `p` is assigned the value 2, which is the starting point for finding prime numbers. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
