The function `func_5` accepts two parameters, `n` and `m`. `n` represents the number of sides of a polygon, and `m` represents the number of vertices Bessie has chosen. The function calls another function `func_1()` exactly `m` times to determine the connections between vertices. After populating a list of adjacency lists `l` with these connections, the function returns `l`, which is a list containing `n + 1` lists. Each inner list in `l` contains exactly two elements, representing the indices of the vertices connected by an edge as determined by `func_1()`.
