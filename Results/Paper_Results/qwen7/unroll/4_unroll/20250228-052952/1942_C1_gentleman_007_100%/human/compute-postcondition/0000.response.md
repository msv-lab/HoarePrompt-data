Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are set to True.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list named `prime` with a length of `num + 1`, where every element in the list is set to `True`. This list is typically used in algorithms to mark numbers as prime or non-prime. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, the list `prime` will have `num + 1` elements, all initially set to `True`.
