State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an integer input from the user, `i` must be 0, `a` must be greater than 0**

### Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration.
- For the loop to execute, the condition `a > 0` must be true.
- The initial value of `i` is 0, as the loop starts with `i` being 0 and will increment it in each iteration.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are `a` (it must be greater than 0) and `i` (it must be 0).
