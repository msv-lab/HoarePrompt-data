Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `range(n)`.
2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` should start from 0 (as per the `range(n)` syntax).
   - `n` is already given as a positive integer not exceeding \(2 \times 10^5\).

3. **Adjust the states of the variables**:
   - `i` needs to be set to 0 because the loop starts with `i = 0`.
   - `n` remains as given but needs to be confirmed as a positive integer.

4. **Consider other variables**:
   - `t`, `k`, `nums`, `a`, `b`, and `ans` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.
   - `s_b` is also not part of the loop head, so its state does not need to be adjusted either.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be a positive integer.

Therefore, the final state is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be a positive integer**
