Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 2 * 10^5, `k` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^15, `nums` is a list of n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `a` is the ceiling value of `k / 2`, `b` is the floor value of `k // 2`, `ans` is the count of indices `i` (where `0 â‰¤ i < n`) such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `a` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `b`, `s_b` is the sum of the last `n` elements of `nums`.
