Reasoning:
The provided program logic does not accurately simulate the process of the Kraken attacking the ships as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic in the `func_1` function does not correctly model the alternating pattern of attacks on the first and last ships. Instead, it calculates the number of ships that would be sunk if the total attacks (`k`) were distributed across all ships without considering the alternating pattern.

Here's a detailed breakdown of why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Attack Pattern**: The function does not alternate between attacking the first and last ships. Instead, it calculates the sum of the first `i+1` elements and the last `i+1` elements of the list `nums` and checks if these sums are less than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. This does not reflect the alternating nature of the attacks.

2. **Sum Calculation**: The sums `s_a` and `s_b` are calculated in a way that does not match the intended behavior. These sums represent cumulative values from the start and end of the list, but they do not account for the fact that the Kraken alternates between attacking the first and last ships.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of indices `i` such that the sum of the first `i+1` elements or the last `i+1` elements is less than or equal to `a` and `b`. This is not equivalent to the number of ships sunk according to the problem's description.

To correctly implement the solution, we need to simulate the alternating attacks on the ships and keep track of which ships have sunk. Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n, k, nums):
    # Initialize the count of sunk ships
    sunk_ships = 0
    
    # While there are still ships left to attack
    while k > 0 and len(nums) > 0:
        # Attack the first ship
        if nums[0] > 0:
            nums[0] -= 1
            if nums[0] == 0:
                nums.pop(0)
                sunk_ships += 1
        else:
            nums.pop(0)
        
        # If there are still ships left, attack the last ship
        if len(nums) > 0 and k > 0:
            if nums[-1] > 0:
                nums[-1] -= 1
                if nums[-1] == 0:
                    nums.pop()
                    sunk_ships += 1
            else:
                nums.pop()
        
        # Decrease the number of remaining attacks
        k -= 1
    
    return sunk_ships
```

This corrected function properly simulates the alternating attacks and correctly counts the number of sunk ships.

Correctness: **False**
