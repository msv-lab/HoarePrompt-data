Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers or -1, depending on the input provided within each iteration of the loop. Each integer in the output corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop, where the result is either \(p1 - x + p3\) if \(y \geq x\) holds true until the end of the while loop, or \(p3\) if the condition is never met. If the sum \(p1 + p2 + p3\) is odd, the output for that iteration will be -1 and the loop will continue to the next iteration.
