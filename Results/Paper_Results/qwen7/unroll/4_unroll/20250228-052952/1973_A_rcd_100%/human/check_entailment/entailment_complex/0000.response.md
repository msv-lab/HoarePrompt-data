Reasoning:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. This part is correct.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores `p1 + p2 + p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case. This is correct because an odd sum cannot be achieved through the given scoring system (where each game results in an even distribution of points).

3. **Condition Check and Calculation**:
   - If `p3 >= p1 + p2`, it directly prints `p1 + p2`. This is correct because in this scenario, the maximum number of draws would be `p1 + p2` since each draw gives 1 point to each player.
   - Otherwise, it enters a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. The variables `x` and `y` are used to represent the number of games won by the first and second players, respectively. The loop ensures that the number of games won by the first player (`x`) does not exceed the number of games won by the second player (`y`). The condition `p1 - x <= p2 - y` ensures that the scores are consistent with the given constraints. If this condition is satisfied, the program prints `p1 - x + p3` which represents the maximum number of draws. If the condition is never met, the program prints `p3`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly handles the output for each test case, printing the calculated value or `-1` as appropriate.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
