The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three integers \(t\), \(p_1\), \(p_2\), and \(p_3\). For each test case, it checks if the sum \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) is even. If the sum is odd, it outputs \(-1\) and moves to the next test case. Otherwise, it calculates and outputs either \(p_1 - x + p_3\) or \(p_3\), depending on the values of \(x\) and \(y\) derived from a specific condition. If no valid \(x\) and \(y\) satisfy the condition, it outputs \(p_3\). The function returns a series of integers or \(-1\) corresponding to each test case.
