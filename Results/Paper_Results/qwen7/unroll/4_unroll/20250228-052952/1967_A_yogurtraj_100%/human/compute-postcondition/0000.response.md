Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `ii` and the expression `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `ii` is less than `int(input())`.

3. **Determine the initial state of the loop head variables**:
   - `ii` starts at 0 because the loop counter typically begins from 0.
   - The value of `int(input())` is not known initially but it will be provided by the user input.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - `ii` should start at 0.
   - For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must provide a positive integer value (since the loop runs as long as `ii < int(input())`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are `ii` and the value of `int(input())`.

**State:**
- `ii` is 0.
- `int(input())` must be a positive integer (since the loop condition checks if `ii < int(input())`).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:
**`ii` is 0, `int(input())` must be a positive integer**.
