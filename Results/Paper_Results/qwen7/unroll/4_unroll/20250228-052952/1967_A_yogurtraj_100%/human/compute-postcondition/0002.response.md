Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^{12}, and for each test case, a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n is provided where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^{12}. After executing the loop, r is an integer representing the final value calculated based on the given conditions, rem is an integer representing the remaining value of k after the loop, and y is an integer representing the number of elements from the sorted list that satisfy the condition (i + 1) * (a[i + 1] - a[i]) > k.
