### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Validation**:
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - The parsing logic seems correct, but we need to ensure that the splitting and type conversion handle all possible edge cases, such as multiple spaces or newlines between numbers.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function takes `n` (number of containers) and `a` (list of water units in each container).
   - It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it is divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct according to the problem statement.
   - If the total water is divisible by `n`, it calculates the target amount of water each container should have (`target = total_water // n`).
   - It then iterates through each container's water amount and keeps track of the difference between the current container's water and the target amount in the variable `container`.
   - If at any point `container` becomes negative, it means it's impossible to balance the water across all containers, so it returns 'No'.
   - If the loop completes without finding such a situation, it returns 'Yes'.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where the total water is not divisible by `n` correctly by returning 'No' immediately.
   - The program also correctly handles the case where the total water is divisible by `n` and checks if it's possible to balance the water.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the way the function is implemented. The function assumes that the water can always be transferred from a container with more water to a container with less water until the difference is zero. This is a valid approach, but the implementation could be more explicit in handling the transfer process.

4. **Output**:
   - The program outputs 'Yes' or 'No' for each test case, which matches the required format.

### Evaluation:

- The function `func_1` correctly checks if the total water can be evenly distributed among the containers.
- The logic for checking if the water can be balanced is sound.
- The function handles the edge cases correctly.
- The implementation is clear and follows the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if the water can be evenly distributed among the containers.

### Final:
**True**
