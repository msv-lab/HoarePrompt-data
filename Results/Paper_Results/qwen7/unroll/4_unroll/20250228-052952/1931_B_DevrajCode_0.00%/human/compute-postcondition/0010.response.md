The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container. The sum of all integers in the list `a` is divisible by `n`.

The function then checks if it's possible to redistribute the water among the containers such that each container has an equal amount of water. If it is possible, the function returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It checks if the water can be equally distributed among the containers. If it can, it returns 'Yes'. If it cannot, it returns 'No'.**
