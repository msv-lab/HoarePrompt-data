Output State: **`total_water` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, and `n` is a positive integer, and the sum of all integers in the list `a` is divisible by `n`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the sum of all integers in the list `a` and assigns it to the variable `total_water`. The initial conditions that `n` is a positive integer and the sum of all integers in the list `a` is divisible by `n` remain unchanged.
