### Reasoning:

Let's break down the program and verify its correctness step-by-step based on the given problem description and the annotated code.

1. **Total Water Divisibility Check**:
   - The program first calculates the total amount of water in all containers.
   - It then checks if this total is divisible by \( n \).
   - If the total is not divisible by \( n \), the function immediately returns 'No'.
   - This check is correct because if the total amount of water is not divisible by \( n \), it is impossible to distribute the water evenly among the containers.

2. **Target Water Calculation**:
   - If the total water is divisible by \( n \), the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have, which is \( \text{target} = \frac{\text{total\_water}}{n} \).
   - This calculation is correct and necessary for determining the even distribution.

3. **Balance Check**:
   - The program then iterates through each container and keeps track of the cumulative difference between the current amount of water and the target amount.
   - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
   - This check ensures that the water can be balanced without any container having a negative amount of water, which is not physically possible.

### Validation Using Annotated Code:

- **Initial State**: 
  - `n` is a positive integer.
  - `a` is a list of `n` integers representing the amounts of water in each container.
  - The sum of all integers in `a` is divisible by `n`.

- **After Total Water Divisibility Check**:
  - If the total water is not divisible by `n`, the function returns 'No'.
  - If the total water is divisible by `n`, the function proceeds to calculate the target amount of water per container.

- **Balance Check**:
  - The program iterates through each container, updating the cumulative difference.
  - If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, the function returns 'No'.
  - If the cumulative difference remains non-negative throughout the iteration, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The steps are logically sound and handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
