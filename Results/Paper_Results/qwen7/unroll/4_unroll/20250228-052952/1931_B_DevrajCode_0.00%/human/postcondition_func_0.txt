The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. It calculates the total amount of water and checks if it can be evenly distributed among the containers represented by the list. If the total water is not divisible by `n`, or if during the distribution process the remaining water in any container becomes negative, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes', indicating the water can be evenly distributed.
