Output State: `total_water` is the sum of all integers in the list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, and `container` is the result after iterating through the list `a` and adjusting it by subtracting `target` from each element, then accumulating the differences, with the condition that if at any point `container` becomes less than 0, the function returns 'No'.
