Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, followed by the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays:**
   - It sorts `a` in ascending order.
   - It sorts `b` in descending order.

3. **Initializing Variables:**
   - `temp` is initialized to `-1` to track if a swap is needed.
   - `ans` is initialized as an empty list to store the differences.

4. **Calculating Differences:**
   - It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and `b`.
   - For each element, it calculates the absolute difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]` and appends it to `ans`.

5. **Checking for Swap:**
   - If at any point, the difference between `a[i]` and `b[-(n - i)]` is greater than the difference between `a[i]` and `b[i]`, it sets `temp` to `i` and breaks out of the loop.
   - This check is intended to ensure that we are maximizing the difference.

6. **Applying the Swap:**
   - If a swap is needed (`temp != -1`), it iterates from `temp` to `n-1` and appends the differences using `b[-(n - i)]`.

7. **Summing Differences:**
   - Finally, it prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

### Correctness Analysis:

- **Sorting:** Sorting `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order is correct because we want to maximize the differences.
- **Swapping Check:** The logic for checking if a swap is needed is flawed. The condition `abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is incorrect because it does not necessarily lead to the maximum difference. Instead, we should compare the potential increase in difference by swapping with the current difference.
- **Applying the Swap:** The way the swap is applied is also incorrect. We need to ensure that the largest elements in `b` are paired with the smallest elements in `a` to maximize the differences.

### Example Test Case Analysis:

Let's consider the first test case from the example:
- `n = 4`, `m = 6`
- `a = [6, 1, 2, 4]`
- `b = [3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3]`

- After sorting:
  - `a = [1, 2, 4, 6]`
  - `b = [7, 5, 3, 3, 2, 1]`

- The program calculates the initial differences:
  - `ans = [abs(1-7), abs(2-5), abs(4-3), abs(6-3)] = [6, 3, 1, 3]`

- Since no swap is needed (`temp = -1`), the final answer is `6 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 13`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion:

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
