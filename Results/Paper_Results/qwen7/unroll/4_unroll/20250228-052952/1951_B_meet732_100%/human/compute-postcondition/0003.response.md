Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the constant `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is not initialized in the given state; it will be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
   - `n` is part of the loop condition but is not explicitly stated in the initial state.

3. **Understand the loop condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` will be set to 0 at the start of the loop, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the other variables in the initial state**:
   - `ind` is an empty list, which doesn't affect the loop execution.
   - `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, but its contents don't matter for the loop to execute.
   - `c` is 0, which also doesn't affect the loop execution.
   - `x` is the `k`-th element of list `a`, but since the loop hasn't started yet, this value isn't relevant for the loop condition.

Based on the above analysis, the only adjustments needed are for the variables `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
