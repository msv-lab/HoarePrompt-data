Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). For each test case, the function determines and returns information based on the values of `t`, `n`, and the list `a`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters, and process them according to the given constraints and relationships.
