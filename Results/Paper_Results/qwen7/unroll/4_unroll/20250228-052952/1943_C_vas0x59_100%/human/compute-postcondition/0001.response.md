Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user; `u2vs` is a list containing `n` empty lists**.

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Since `n` is an integer entered by the user, its value remains unchanged. The variable `u2vs` now holds a list of `n` empty lists.
