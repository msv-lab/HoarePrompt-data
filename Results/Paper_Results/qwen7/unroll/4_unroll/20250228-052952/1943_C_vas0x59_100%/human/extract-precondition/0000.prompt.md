You are given a programming problem description and a function that contributes to the solution of this problem. The total solution compromises of multiple functions and this is just one of them. 
From the problem description, and based on the variables used in the signature of this specific function, extract a description of the values of the variables in the function signature and the relationship between them. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:
Remember the function given may not solve the problem directly but perform a side functionality that contributes to the total solution. Include information only about the variables in the function signature.
# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Program:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
	tc = [[0 for x in range(C)] for x in range(R)]
	tc[0][0] = cost[0][0]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		tc[i][0] = tc[i-1][0] + cost[i][0]
	for j in range(1, n+1):
		tc[0][j] = tc[0][j-1] + cost[0][j]
	for i in range(1, m+1):
		for j in range(1, n+1):
			tc[i][j] = min(tc[i-1][j-1], tc[i-1][j], tc[i][j-1]) + cost[i][j]
	return tc[m][n]
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Program:
```
def are_similar(elem, elem1):
  if elem == elem1:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

Precondition: **elem1 and elem are values of any type and value**
# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify if 2 consecutive integers in a list are not prime".
Program:
```
import math
def is_not_prime(n):
    result = False
    for i in range(2,int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            result = True
    return result
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Program:
```
import heapq as hq
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
  largest_nums = hq.nlargest(n, nums)
  return largest_nums
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**


# Your task

Problem description: You are given a tree with n vertices numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, all
vertices are colored white.

You can perform the following two-step operation:

  1. Choose a vertex v (1 \leq v \leq n ) and a distance d (0 \leq d \leq n-1 ). 
  2. For all vertices u (1 \leq u \leq n ) such that \text{dist}^\dagger(u,v)=d , color u black. 

Construct a sequence of operations to color all the nodes in the tree black
using the minimum possible number of operations. It can be proven that it is
always possible to do so using at most n operations.

^\dagger \text{dist}(x, y) denotes the number of edges on the (unique) simple
path between vertices x and y on the tree.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 200 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^3 ) — the number of vertices of the tree.

The following n - 1 lines of each test case describe the edges of the tree.
The i -th of these lines contains two integers u_i and v_i (1 \le u_i, v_i \le
n , u_i \neq v_i ), the indices of the vertices connected by the i -th edge.

It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^3 .

Output

For each test case, first output a single integer op (1 \le op \le n) , the
minimum number of operations needed to color all vertices of the tree black.

Then, output op lines, each containing 2 integers. The i -th line should
contain the values of v and d chosen for the i -th operation (1 \le v \le n ,
0 \le d \le n - 1 )

You must guarantee that at the end of op operations, all vertices are colored
black.

If there are multiple solutions, you may output any one of them.

    7 1
    2 1

Note

In the first test case, there is only one possible operation, and performing
it gives us a valid answer.

In the second test case, the first operation colors vertex 2 black, and the
second operation colors vertex 1 black. It can be shown that it is impossible
to color both vertices black in one operation, so the minimum number of
operations needed is 2 . Another possible solution is to use the 2 operations:
(u, r) = (1, 0) and (u, r) = (2, 0) .

In the third test case, the first operation colors vertices 2 , 3 and 4 black,
and the second operation colors vertex 1 black. Again, it can be shown that it
is impossible to color all vertices black in 1 operation, so the minimum
number of operations needed is 2 .

In the fourth test case, the first operation colors vertices 4 , 1 and 7
black, the second operation colors vertices 2 , 5 and 6 black while the third
operation colors vertices 3 and 7 black. Notice that it is allowed to color
vertex 7 black twice.

Thus, each node was marked at least once, with node 7 marked twice. It can be
shown that it is impossible to color all vertices black in fewer than 3 moves.

    u2vs = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for _ in range(n - 1):

        u -= 1
        v -= 1
        u2vs[u].append(v)

    ops = []

        for i in range(ci + 1):
            ops.append((c, i))
    else:
        ci2 = len(path_ba) // 2
        ci1 = ci2 - 1
        c1 = path_ba[ci1]
        c2 = path_ba[ci2]
        for i in range(1, len(path_ba) - ci1, 2):
            ops.append((c1, i))
            ops.append((c2, i))
    print(len(ops))
    print(*map(lambda x: f'{x[0] + 1} {x[1]}', ops), sep='\n')
    return None
