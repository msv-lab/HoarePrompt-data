Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user, `u2vs` remains unchanged**.

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the user input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `u2vs` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it within the given code snippet. The precondition that `n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^3, is preserved.
