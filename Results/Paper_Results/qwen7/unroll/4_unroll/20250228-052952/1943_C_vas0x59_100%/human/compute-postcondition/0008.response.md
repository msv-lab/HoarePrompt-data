Output State: **`n` is an integer entered by the user; `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains integers representing the indices of other lists it is connected to through pairs `(u, v)` entered via input; `d` is a list of integers where each element represents the shortest distance from node 0 to the corresponding node; `previous` is a list obtained from BFS starting from the value of `a`; `a` is the return value of `func_1(d); b` is the return value of `func_1(d)`**.

Explanation: The code `b = func_1(d)` assigns the return value of `func_1(d)` to the variable `b`. Since `d` is a list of integers representing the shortest distances from node 0 to other nodes, `func_1(d)` returns a value which is then assigned to `b`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
