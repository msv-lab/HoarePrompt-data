Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that prevent it from correctly calculating the minimum number of screens needed to place the icons. Here are the key problems:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Total Space Required:**
   - The variable `space_x` is correctly calculated as the total space required for 1x1 icons.
   - However, `space_y` should be calculated as the total space required for 2x2 icons, which is `y * 4`, but this value is not used correctly in the subsequent calculations.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Screen Requirements for 2x2 Icons:**
   - The variable `screen_require_for_y` is calculated as `y // 2` or `y // 2 + 1` depending on whether `y` is even or odd. This calculation is incorrect because it does not account for the actual space required by 2x2 icons.
   - The correct way to calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons would be to divide the total number of 2x2 icons by the number of 2x2 icons that can fit on one screen (which is 3, since each screen has 5 rows and 3 columns).

3. **Incorrect Calculation of Remaining Cells:**
   - The calculation of `remaining_cells` is incorrect and does not reflect the actual remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.

4. **Incorrect Handling of Remaining Space:**
   - The logic for handling the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons is flawed. It incorrectly assumes that the remaining space can always be filled with 1x1 icons without considering the grid layout constraints.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    result = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (x, y) = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons
        screen_require_for_y = (y + 2) // 3
        # Calculate the space required for 1x1 icons
        space_x = x
        # Calculate the space available after placing 2x2 icons
        space_available = 15 * screen_require_for_y - (y * 4)
        # Calculate the number of additional screens needed for 1x1 icons
        extra_screens = (space_x + space_available - 1) // space_available
        # Total number of screens needed
        total_screens = screen_require_for_y + extra_screens
        result.append(total_screens)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, result)))

func()
```

This corrected version properly calculates the number of screens needed for both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, ensuring that the solution is correct according to the problem statement.
