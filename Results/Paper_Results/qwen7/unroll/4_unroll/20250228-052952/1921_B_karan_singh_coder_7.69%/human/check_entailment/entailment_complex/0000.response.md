Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `s`, and `t`.
3. It calculates the number of '1's in both `s` and `t` using `s1 = s.count('1')` and `t1 = t.count('1')`.
4. It then counts the number of differing positions between `s` and `t` using `cnt = sum([s[i] != t[i] for i in range(n)])`.
5. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are equal (`s1 == t1`), it prints `s1` if `cnt` is zero, otherwise it prints `0`.
6. If the number of '1's in `s` and `t` are different (`s1 != t1`), it calculates the difference `d = abs(s1 - t1)` and prints `(cnt - d) // 2 + d`.

This logic matches the problem statement and ensures that the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state `s` to the desired state `t` is calculated correctly.

Correctness: **True**
