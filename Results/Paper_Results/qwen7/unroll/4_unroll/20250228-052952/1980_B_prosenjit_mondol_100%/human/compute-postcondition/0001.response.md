Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'NO', 'YES', and 'MAYBE' responses based on the comparison between the k-th largest element in the sorted list `a` (after sorting in descending order) and the element at index `f` in the original list `a`. For each test case, if the k-th largest element is greater than the element at index `f`, the output is 'NO'. If it is smaller, the output is 'YES'. If they are equal, the output is 'YES' unless the k-th element is the second-to-last element in the list and the element next to it (at index k+1) is also equal to the element at index `f`, in which case the output is 'MAYBE'.
