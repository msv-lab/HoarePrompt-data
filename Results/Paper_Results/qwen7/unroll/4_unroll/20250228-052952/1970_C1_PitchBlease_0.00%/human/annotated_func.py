#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, and start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly two leaves.
def func_1(n, edges, start):
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The `edges` list remains unchanged, and `start` retains its original integer value such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.
    leaves = [node for node in tree if len(tree[node]) == 1]
    dist1 = bfs(start, leaves[0])
    dist2 = bfs(start, leaves[1])
    if (dist1 % 2 == 0 or dist2 % 2 == 0) :
        return 'Ron'
        #The program returns 'Ron'
    else :
        return 'Hermione'
        #The program returns the string 'Hermione'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (an integer), `edges` (a list of tuples representing the edges of a tree), and `start` (an integer). It constructs a tree representation using the provided edges. Then, it identifies the two leaves of the tree and calculates the shortest path distances from the `start` node to each leaf. Based on whether these distances are even or odd, the function returns either 'Ron' or 'Hermione'.
