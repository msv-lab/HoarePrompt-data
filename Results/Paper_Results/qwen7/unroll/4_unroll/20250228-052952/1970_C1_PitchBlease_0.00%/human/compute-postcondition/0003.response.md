Output State: `tree` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and its value is a dictionary where each key represents a node in the tree, and its corresponding value is a list of nodes connected to it by an edge. The `edges` list remains unchanged, and `start` retains its original integer value such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n.
