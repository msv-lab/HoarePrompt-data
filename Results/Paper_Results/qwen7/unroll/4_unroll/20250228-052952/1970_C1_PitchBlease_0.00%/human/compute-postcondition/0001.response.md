Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

Explanation: The code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the `start` node to it. The `queue` and `target` remain unchanged from their initial state.
