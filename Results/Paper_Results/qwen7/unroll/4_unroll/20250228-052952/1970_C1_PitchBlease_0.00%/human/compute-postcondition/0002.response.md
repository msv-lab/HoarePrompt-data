The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on whether `queue` is non-empty (i.e., contains at least one element).

Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`. This means that `queue` is not empty and thus the loop can execute the first time.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to proceed.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple `(start, 0)`, `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the two leaves of the tree, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`**
