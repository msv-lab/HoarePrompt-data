### Reasoning

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function 1: `func_1()`

1. **Initialization**:
   - The program initializes several lists: `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef0`, `coef1`, and `nodes`.
   - It reads the input for the coordinates and radii of the disks.

2. **Main Logic**:
   - The program iterates over each disk and performs a depth-first search (DFS) if the disk has not been visited.
   - During the DFS, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` arrays based on the tangency conditions.
   - After the DFS, it checks if the sum of the radii can be decreased by verifying if `c1` (sum of `coef1`) is non-zero.

3. **DFS Function (`dfs()`)**:
   - The DFS function marks the current node as visited and adds it to the `nodes` list.
   - For each neighboring node, it checks if the disks are tangent.
   - If they are tangent, it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values accordingly and recursively calls `dfs()` on the neighboring node.

#### Issues Identified in the Original Assessment

1. **Incorrect Handling of Coefficients**:
   - The `coef0` and `coef1` values are updated based on the tangency condition, but the logic does not ensure that the sum of the radii can be decreased.
   - The program does not explicitly check if the sum of the radii can be reduced while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

2. **No Decrease in Sum of Radii**:
   - The program does not verify if the sum of the radii can be decreased. It only checks if the tangency condition is met, which is insufficient to ensure the problem's requirements.

#### Example Analysis

Consider the first example provided in the problem statement:

**Input:**
```
5
0 2 1
0 0 1
4 -3 4
11 0 3
11 5 2
```

**Expected Output:**
```
YES
```

The program should be able to find a way to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency and ensuring no overlap. However, the current implementation does not guarantee this.

For instance, the program might update the coefficients but does not ensure that the sum of the radii can be strictly decreased. The DFS traversal alone is not sufficient to solve the problem as stated.

### Conclusion

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the radii of the disks can be changed in the desired manner. Specifically, the program does not ensure that the sum of the radii can be decreased while maintaining tangency and avoiding overlap.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**
