Output State: **All `visited[j]` are `True`; `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated based on the conditions; `nodes` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The loop iterates over all disks `j` from `0` to `n-1`. For each disk `j`, it calculates the distance between the centers of disks `i` and `j`. If disk `j` has not been visited (`visited[j]` is `False`) and the sum of the radii of disks `i` and `j` equals the Euclidean distance between their centers, then it updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for disk `j` based on the corresponding values for disk `i`. Additionally, it triggers a DFS traversal starting from disk `j`. Since the loop does not modify the `visited[i]` or the `nodes` list directly within its body, these states remain unchanged. After the loop completes, all disks will have been visited, hence `visited[j]` will be `True` for all `j`.
