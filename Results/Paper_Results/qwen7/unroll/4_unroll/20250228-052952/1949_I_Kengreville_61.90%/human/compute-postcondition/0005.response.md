Postcondition: **All `visited[j]` are `True`; `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` are updated based on the conditions; `nodes` remains unchanged.**

This postcondition indicates that if the condition `not visited[i]` is true, then all elements in the `visited` list are marked as `True`, and the `coef0[j]` and `coef1[j]` lists are updated according to certain conditions. Additionally, the `nodes` list remains unchanged. If the condition is false, no changes occur.
