You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, x is a list of n integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, y is a list of n integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, r is a list of n integers representing the radii of the disks, visited is a list of n boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited during the DFS, coef0 and coef1 are lists of n floating-point numbers used to store coefficients for the linear equations, and nodes is a list used to store nodes during the DFS traversal.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        x[i], y[i], r[i] = map(int, input().split())
        
    #State: Output State: `visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `x` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `y` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `r` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `coef0` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, and `nodes` is now an empty list.
    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
        
    #State: Output State: `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True`, `x` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `y` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `r` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `True`.
    if ok :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    else :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    #State: `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True`, `x` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `y` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `r` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` remains unchanged (either `True` or `False`).
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n (an integer between 1 and 1000), x (a list of n integers), y (a list of n integers), r (a list of n integers), visited (a list of n boolean values), coef0 (a list of n floating-point numbers), coef1 (a list of n floating-point numbers), and nodes (a list). The function does not return anything.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
