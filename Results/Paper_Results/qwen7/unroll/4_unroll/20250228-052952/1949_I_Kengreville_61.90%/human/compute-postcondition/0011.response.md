Output State: **`visited` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `x` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `y` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `r` is a list of length `n` containing `int` values, `coef0` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `coef1` is a list of length `n` filled with `None`, `nodes` is an empty list, and `ok` is `False`.**

The code simply assigns `False` to the variable `ok`, which was not previously initialized or affected by any other operations. All other variables retain their initial states.
