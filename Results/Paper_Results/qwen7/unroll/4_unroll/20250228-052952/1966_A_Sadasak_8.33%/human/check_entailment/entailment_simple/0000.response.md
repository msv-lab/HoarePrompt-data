### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It reads `n` and `k` for each test case, followed by the list of card numbers `nums`.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n` because we cannot perform any exchanges since we don't have enough cards to form a group of `k`.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1` because we can exchange all cards into `k - 1` new cards.

3. **General Case**:
   - The program calls the function `func_1` to get the frequency table of card numbers, ensuring no number appears more than `k` times.
   - After obtaining the frequency table, the program checks if any number's occurrence is exactly `k`. If so, it prints `k - 1` because we can exchange this group of `k` cards into `k - 1` new cards.
   - If no number's occurrence is exactly `k`, the program prints `n` because no further exchanges can reduce the number of cards.

4. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly updates the frequency of each card number to ensure no number appears more than `k` times.
   - It returns a dictionary where each key is a card number and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like when `k > n` and `k == n` correctly.
   - For other cases, the logic ensures that the number of cards is minimized by exchanging groups of `k` cards.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards remaining after performing the allowed operations. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
