Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of cards that can remain after performing the specified operations any number of times. The operations allow exchanging k identical cards for k-1 new cards.
2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the number `k` used in the operation.
   - It then reads the list of card numbers.
   - The program checks three conditions:
     - If `k > n`, the minimum number of cards cannot be reduced below `n`, so it prints `n`.
     - If `k == n`, it prints `k - 1` because all cards can be exchanged once, leaving `k - 1` cards.
     - Otherwise, it calls `func_1` to process the card numbers and determine the frequency of each number, capping the count at `k` if it exceeds `k`.
   - The function `func_1` correctly creates a frequency table where each key is a card number and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.
   - After processing the frequency table, the program checks if `k` is present as a value in the frequency table. If it is, it prints `k - 1` because `k` can be reduced by one. Otherwise, it prints `n` because no further reduction is possible.

3. **Edge Cases and Validity**:
   - The program handles edge cases like `k > n` and `k == n` correctly.
   - The function `func_1` correctly processes the list and creates the frequency table.
   - The logic in the main program to determine the minimum number of cards is sound.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
