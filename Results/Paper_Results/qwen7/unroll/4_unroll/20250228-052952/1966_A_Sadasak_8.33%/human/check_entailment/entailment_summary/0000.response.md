Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
2. The provided program has a few issues:
   - The function `func_1` is not used correctly in the main logic.
   - The logic to determine the minimum number of cards left is flawed.
3. Let's analyze the main logic:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is incorrect because you can always reduce the number of cards to `k - 1` by exchanging `k` cards.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also incorrect because you can't perform any operations and must keep all `n` cards.
   - For the general case (`k < n`), the program uses `func_1` but does not correctly interpret its results.
4. The function `func_1` creates a frequency table where each number's count is capped at `k`. However, the main logic should use this information to determine the minimum number of cards left.
5. A correct approach would be to find the minimum frequency of any number in the frequency table, as this will dictate the minimum number of cards left after performing the operations.

Given these points, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
