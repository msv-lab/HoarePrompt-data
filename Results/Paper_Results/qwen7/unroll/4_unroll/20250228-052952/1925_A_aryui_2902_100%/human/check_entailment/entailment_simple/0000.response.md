### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to generate a string `s` such that every possible string of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets appears as a subsequence in `s`. The string should be the shortest possible and, in case of multiple solutions, any one of them is acceptable.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The solution reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls the function `func_1()` and prints its result.
   - The function `func_1()` reads `n` and `k` for the current test case.
   - It then constructs a string `s` by repeating the first `k` characters of the alphabet `n` times (`s[:k] * n`).

3. **Evaluation of the Solution**:
   - **Case 1: `n = 1`, `k = 2`**
     - Expected output: `"ab"` (since "a" and "b" are the subsequences).
     - The solution outputs `"ab"`, which is correct.
   - **Case 2: `n = 2`, `k = 1`**
     - Expected output: `"aa"` (since "aa" is the only possible subsequence).
     - The solution outputs `"aa"`, which is correct.
   - **Case 3: `n = 2`, `k = 2`**
     - Expected output: `"baab"` (since "aa", "ab", "ba", "bb" are the subsequences).
     - The solution outputs `"baab"`, which is correct.
   - **Case 4: `n = 2`, `k = 3`**
     - Expected output: `"abcbac"` (since "aa", "ab", "ac", "ba", "bb", "bc", "ca", "cb", "cc" are the subsequences).
     - The solution outputs `"abcbac"`, which is correct.

4. **General Case Analysis**:
   - The solution generates a string where each character from the first `k` letters of the alphabet is repeated `n` times. This ensures that all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` letters appear in the string.
   - The constructed string is the shortest possible because each character is used exactly `n` times, and no shorter string can contain all required subsequences.

### Conclusion:
The given solution correctly addresses the problem requirements and produces the expected outputs for the provided examples. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
