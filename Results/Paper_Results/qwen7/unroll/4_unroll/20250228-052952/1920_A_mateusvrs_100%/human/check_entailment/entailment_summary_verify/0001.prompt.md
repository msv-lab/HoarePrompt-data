You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

- Program:

    t = int(input())
    r = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        cx = set()
        ax = int(1000000000.0 + 7)
        bx = -1
        for _ in range(n):
            (a, x) = map(int, input().split())
            if a == 1:
                bx = max(x, bx)
            elif a == 2:
                ax = min(x, ax)
            else:
                cx.add(x)
        if bx > ax:
            r.append(0)
        else:
            tmp = 0
            for i in cx:
                if i >= bx and i <= ax:
                    tmp += 1
            r.append(ax - bx + 1 - tmp)
    print(*r, sep='\n')



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and `n` integers representing constraints. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the constraints and stores these values in a list `r`. Finally, it prints the elements of `r`, each on a new line. The values in `r` are determined by comparing the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) with the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`), and counting the number of type 3 constraints within this range. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the result is 0; otherwise, it calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx` and subtracts the count of type 3 constraints within this range.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The function initializes `t` to read the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the number of constraints `n`.
   - For each constraint, it reads the type `a` and value `x`.

2. **Constraint Handling:**
   - It uses a set `cx` to store values of `x` for the "not equal to" constraints (`a == 3`).
   - It maintains two variables `ax` and `bx` to track the upper and lower bounds for the "less than or equal to" and "greater than or equal to" constraints respectively.
     - `ax` is initialized to a large value (1000000007) to ensure any valid `x` will update it.
     - `bx` is initialized to -1 to ensure any valid `x` will update it.

3. **Processing Constraints:**
   - For each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, it updates `bx` to the maximum of `bx` and `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, it updates `ax` to the minimum of `ax` and `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, it adds `x` to the set `cx`.

4. **Validation and Calculation:**
   - After processing all constraints, it checks if `bx > ax`. If true, it means no valid `k` exists, so it appends `0` to the result list `r`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of valid `k` values by subtracting the count of elements in `cx` within the range `[bx, ax]` from the total range length `(ax - bx + 1)`.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the valid range of `k`.
- The use of sets to store values for "not equal to" constraints ensures no duplicates and efficiently checks membership.
- The logic for updating bounds and calculating the valid range is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the solution based on the problem statement and constraints.
