You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

    #This is printed: the elements of the list r, each on a new line
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and `n` integers representing constraints. For each test case, it calculates a value based on the constraints and stores these values in a list `r`. Finally, it prints the elements of `r`, each on a new line. The values in `r` are determined by comparing the maximum value of type 1 constraints (`bx`) with the minimum value of type 2 constraints (`ax`), and counting the number of type 3 constraints within this range. If `bx` is greater than `ax`, the result is 0; otherwise, it calculates the difference between `ax` and `bx` and subtracts the count of type 3 constraints within this range.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where there are overlapping constraints correctly. Specifically, the program calculates the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts the number of elements in `cx` that fall within this range. However, it does not account for the fact that the constraints could overlap in such a way that the range `[bx, ax]` might include elements from `cx`.

For example, consider the following constraints:
- `1 3` (k must be ≥ 3)
- `2 10` (k must be ≤ 10)
- `3 1` (k must not be 1)
- `3 5` (k must not be 5)

The program would calculate `bx = 3` and `ax = 10`, and then check for elements in `cx` that are between 3 and 10. However, it does not correctly handle the exclusion of 1 and 5, leading to an incorrect count.

To fix this, the program needs to properly account for all constraints and ensure that the range `[bx, ax]` is adjusted to exclude elements in `cx`.
