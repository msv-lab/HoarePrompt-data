Based on the initial state provided:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\).
- `r` is a list containing integers calculated based on the conditions inside the loop for each iteration.

However, the code snippet provided does not include any loop or explicit calculation for the list `r`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact contents of `r` from the given information. The `print(*r, sep='\n')` statement will simply print the elements of the list `r`, each on a new line.

Given this, the output will be the elements of the list `r`, but since we do not have the specific values, we can only describe it in general terms.

Output: **the elements of the list r, each on a new line**
