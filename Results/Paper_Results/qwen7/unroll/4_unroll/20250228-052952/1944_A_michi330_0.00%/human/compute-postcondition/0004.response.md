Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ k ≤ n * (n - 1) / 2). For each test case, it returns information based on the values of `n` and `k`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing values for `t`, `n`, and `k`. It processes these values according to specified constraints and returns relevant information based on the relationship between `n` and `k`.
