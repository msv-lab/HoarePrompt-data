Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it prints `1`; otherwise, it prints `n - 1`. This process is repeated `t` times, where `t` is the number of test cases provided by the user. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case.**
