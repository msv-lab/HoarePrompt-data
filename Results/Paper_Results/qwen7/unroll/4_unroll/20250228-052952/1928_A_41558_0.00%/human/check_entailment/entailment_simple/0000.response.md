### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining if a given rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then reformed into a different rectangle. The key conditions provided in the solution are:
   - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the answer is 'NO'.
   - If \(a/2 = b\) or \(b/2 = a\), the answer is 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, the answer is 'YES'.

2. **Conditions Analysis**:
   - **Condition 1**: If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the rectangle cannot be divided into two smaller rectangles with even dimensions, making it impossible to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.
   - **Condition 2**: If \(a/2 = b\) or \(b/2 = a\), the resulting rectangles would have the same dimensions when rotated, meaning no new distinct rectangle can be formed.

3. **Implementation Check**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - It checks the conditions for each pair \((a, b)\) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' accordingly.
   - The logic matches the problem statement and handles all given examples correctly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases like odd dimensions and specific equalities correctly.
   - It also handles large inputs within the specified constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^9).

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Correctness:
**True**
