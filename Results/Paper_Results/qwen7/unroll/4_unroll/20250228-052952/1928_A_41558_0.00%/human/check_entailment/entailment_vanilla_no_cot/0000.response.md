Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle. Here's why:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The condition `if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:` is unnecessary and incorrect. If both dimensions are odd, the rectangle cannot be split into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, but this alone doesn't guarantee that no other rectangle can be formed.

2. **Special Case Check**: The condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a:` is incorrect. This checks if one dimension is exactly half of the other, which is a special case where no further rectangle can be formed. However, this is too restrictive and misses many valid cases.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following:

- A rectangle can always be split into two smaller rectangles.
- The key is to check if the resulting rectangles can be recombined into a different rectangle.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for _ in range(n):
        a, b = map(int, input().split())
        # If either dimension is 1, no new rectangle can be formed
        if a == 1 or b == 1:
            print("NO")
        else:
            # If the rectangle can be split into two smaller rectangles
            # and those smaller rectangles can form a different rectangle
            print("YES")

func()
```

This solution correctly handles all edge cases and ensures that the logic is sound.
