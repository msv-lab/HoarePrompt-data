Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the conditions provided. Specifically, for each pair (a, b) entered, if either a or b is odd and both are odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, then 'NO' is printed; otherwise, 'YES' is printed. The final state will be a sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' outputs corresponding to the given pairs (a, b).
