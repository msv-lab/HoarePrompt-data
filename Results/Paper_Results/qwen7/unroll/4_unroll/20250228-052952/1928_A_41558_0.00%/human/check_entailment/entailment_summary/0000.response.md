Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the logic in the `func` function aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.

1. **Problem Statement Analysis**:
   - Bob can cut a rectangle into two smaller rectangles by making a cut parallel to one of its sides.
   - From the resulting rectangles, he can form another rectangle by arranging them.
   - Two rectangles are considered the same if they are rotations of each other (e.g., 2x6 and 6x2).

2. **Key Conditions for Forming Another Rectangle**:
   - If both dimensions \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and not equal, Bob can always form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - If either dimension is even, Bob can also form another rectangle by cutting along the even dimension.

3. **Conditions in the Code**:
   - The code checks if both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd and not equal (`if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0 and a != b`).
   - It also checks if either \(a/2\) equals \(b\) or \(b/2\) equals \(a\) (`elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a`).

4. **Analysis of Conditions**:
   - The condition `a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0 and a != b` correctly identifies cases where both dimensions are odd and not equal, allowing the formation of another rectangle.
   - However, the condition `elif a / 2 == b or b / 2 == a` incorrectly flags certain cases where a rectangle can still be formed. For example, a 2x6 rectangle should be able to form a 4x3 rectangle, but the current condition would incorrectly flag it as "NO".

5. **Examples Verification**:
   - The examples provided in the problem statement show that the program fails to correctly identify some cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation is incorrect because it fails to handle some valid cases where a new rectangle can be formed.

Correctness: **False**
