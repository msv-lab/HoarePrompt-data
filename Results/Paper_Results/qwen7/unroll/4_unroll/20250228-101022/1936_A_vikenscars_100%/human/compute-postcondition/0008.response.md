Based on the initial state provided:

- `pair_idx` is the index `i` for which `func_1(max_item_idx, max_item_idx, i, i)` returns '<' and `func_1(pair_idx, pair_idx, i, i)` returns '>' or `max_item_idx` if no such `i` exists within the range 1 to n-1. 

This means that `pair_idx` is determined by checking the conditions with `func_1` for each index `i` from 1 to n-1. If there is an index `i` that satisfies both conditions, `pair_idx` will be set to that index. Otherwise, it will remain `max_item_idx`.

Given this, let's break down the `print(f'! {max_item_idx} {pair_idx}')` statement:

- `max_item_idx` is the original value that `pair_idx` was set to initially.
- `pair_idx` could either be `max_item_idx` if no suitable `i` was found or the index `i` that satisfies the conditions mentioned.

Since the exact value of `max_item_idx` and the function `func_1` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `pair_idx`. However, we know that `pair_idx` will be either `max_item_idx` or some other index `i` that meets the specified conditions.

Therefore, the output will be a string that includes the value of `max_item_idx` and `pair_idx`.

Output: **! [max_item_idx] [pair_idx]**
