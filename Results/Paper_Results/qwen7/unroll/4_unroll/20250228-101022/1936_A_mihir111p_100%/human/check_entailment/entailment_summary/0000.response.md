Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing \((p_a \mid p_b)\) with \((p_c \mid p_d)\) and receiving a comparison result.

2. **Analyzing the Code**:
   - The code iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) to find a potential candidate for the index \(ans1\). This is done using the `func_1` function, which compares \((p_{ans1} \mid p_{ans1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_i)\). Since \((p_i \mid p_i) = p_i\) for any index \(i\), this step essentially finds a candidate for the highest single value in the permutation.
   - Next, it initializes `mx` to 0 and a list `v` containing 0. It then iterates through the indices from 1 to \(n-1\) again, comparing \((p_{mx} \mid p_{ans1})\) with \((p_i \mid p_{ans1})\). If the former is less than the latter, it updates `mx` and resets `v` to contain only the current index \(i\). If they are equal, it appends the current index \(i\) to `v`.
   - After identifying potential candidates, it selects the best candidate from `v` by comparing \((p_{ans} \mid p_{ans})\) with \((p_{v[i]} \mid p_{v[i]})\) for each candidate in `v`. The candidate with the highest value is selected as `ans`.
   - Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The approach seems to correctly identify a potential candidate for the highest value in the permutation and then refine the selection to maximize the XOR.
   - The use of at most \(3n\) queries aligns with the problem constraints.
   - The logic for selecting the best candidate from the refined set of indices appears sound.

Given the analysis, the provided code attempts to solve the problem as specified and adheres to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
