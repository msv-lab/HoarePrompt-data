Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Each query involves comparing the bitwise OR of two pairs of elements in the permutation \(p\).

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The code iterates through the permutation to initialize `ans1` with the first index that gives a larger OR value compared to `ans1`.
   - Then, it finds the maximum value `mx` and a list `v` of indices that give the same OR value as `mx`.
   - Finally, it selects the best index from `v` to maximize the XOR value.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - **Initialization of `ans1`**: The loop initializes `ans1` with the first index greater than 0 that provides a higher OR value compared to `ans1`. This step is correct.
   - **Finding `mx` and `v`**: The code correctly identifies the maximum OR value and collects all indices that achieve this value in the list `v`.
   - **Selecting the Best Index**: The final loop correctly selects the index from `v` that maximizes the XOR value.

4. **Query Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly prints the query and waits for the response, which is used to compare the OR values.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - The logic for finding the maximum XOR value is sound and follows the problem's constraints.
   - The number of queries is managed within the limit of \(3n\).

Given the analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
