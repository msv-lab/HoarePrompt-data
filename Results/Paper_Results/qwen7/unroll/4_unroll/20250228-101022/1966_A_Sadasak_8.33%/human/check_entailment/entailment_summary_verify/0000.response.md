### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program and the function summary step-by-step.

#### Input Handling and Initial Checks:
1. **Input Reading**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `k > n`, the program prints `n`. This is correct because if `k` is greater than the number of cards, no exchanges can be made.
   - If `k == n`, the program prints `k - 1`. This is also correct because if `k` equals the number of cards, you can exchange all cards into `k - 1` cards.
   - For the general case (`k < n`), the program calls `func_1` to get the frequency table and then checks if `k` exists as a frequency. If it does, it prints `k - 1`; otherwise, it prints `n`.

#### Function `func_1`:
- **Function Description**: The function `func_1` returns a dictionary where each key is a number from the input array `arr`, and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.
- **Behavior Analysis**:
  - The function correctly counts the occurrences of each number in the array and caps them at `k` if they exceed `k`.
  - However, the function does not help in determining the minimum number of cards left after optimal exchanges. It only provides the frequency table up to `k`.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The initial checks (`if k > n` and `if k == n`) are correct.
- The main issue lies in the logic after calling `func_1`. The program assumes that if `k` exists as a frequency, the result should be `k - 1`. This is not always true. For example, consider the input:
  ```
  3 3
  2 2 2
  ```
  - The frequency table would be `{2: 3}`, and since `3` exists as a frequency, the program prints `2`. However, the correct output should be `1` because we can exchange all three `2`s into one card.

- The function `func_1` does not help in finding the optimal way to merge cards. It only provides the frequency table, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of cards left.

#### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the scenario where multiple groups of `k` identical cards exist and need to be optimally merged. The logic in the main part of the program is flawed and does not ensure the minimum number of cards is achieved.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not handle the optimal merging of cards when multiple groups of `k` identical cards exist.
