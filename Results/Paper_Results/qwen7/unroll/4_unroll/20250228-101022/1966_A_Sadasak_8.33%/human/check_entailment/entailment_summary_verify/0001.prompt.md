You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a hand of n cards, where each card has a number written on it, and a
fixed integer k . You can perform the following operation any number of times:

  * Choose any k cards from your hand that all have the same number. 
  * Exchange these cards for k-1 cards, each of which can have any number you choose (including the number written on the cards you just exchanged). 

Here is one possible sequence of operations for the first example case, which
has k=3 :

What is the minimum number of cards you can have in your hand at the end of
this process?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le
100 , 2 \le k \le 100 ) — the number of cards you have, and the number of
cards you exchange during each operation, respectively.

The next line of each test case contains n integers c_1, c_2, \ldots c_n (1
\le c_i \le 100 ) — the numbers written on your cards.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of cards you
can have left in your hand after any number of operations.

Note

The first example case corresponds to the picture above. The sequence of
operations displayed there is optimal, so the answer is 2 .

In the second example case, no operations can be performed, so the answer is 1
.

In the fourth example case, you can repeatedly select 4 cards numbered with 1
and replace them with 3 cards numbered with 1 , until there are 3 cards left.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    nums = list(map(int, input().split()))
    if k > n:
        print(n)
    elif k == n:
        print(k - 1)
    else:
        freq = func_1(nums, k)
        if k in freq.values():
            print(k - 1)
        else:
            print(n)

def func_1(arr, k):
    frequency_table = {}
    for num in arr:
        frequency_table[num] = frequency_table.get(num, 0) + 1
        if frequency_table[num] > k:
            frequency_table[num] = k
    return frequency_table



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. It returns a dictionary `frequency_table` where each key is a number from `arr`, and its value is the maximum occurrence of that number up to `k`. If any number's occurrence exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`. All other keys not present in `arr` are excluded from the dictionary.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to minimize the number of cards left after performing the specified operations.
   - Each operation allows us to exchange `k` cards with the same number for `k-1` new cards.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of cards (`n`) and the value of `k`.
   - It then reads the values of the cards into a list (`nums`).

3. **Checking the Conditions:**
   - If `k > n`, we cannot perform any operations, so the result is `n`.
   - If `k == n`, we can only perform one operation, resulting in `k-1` cards.
   - Otherwise, the code calls `func_1(nums, k)` to get the frequency table of card numbers.
     - If `k` appears in the frequency table, we can perform operations until we have fewer than `k` cards of that number, leaving `k-1` cards.
     - Otherwise, no operations can be performed, and the result is `n`.

4. **Reviewing `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` correctly creates a frequency table for the card numbers.
   - If the frequency of any number exceeds `k`, it is capped at `k`.
   - This function is used to check if `k` can be achieved as a frequency in the card numbers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The code handles the edge cases where `k > n` and `k == n` correctly.
   - The logic for checking if `k` can be a frequency in the card numbers is sound.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of cards left after performing the specified operations. There are no logical errors or omissions that would lead to incorrect results.

### Correctness:
**True**
