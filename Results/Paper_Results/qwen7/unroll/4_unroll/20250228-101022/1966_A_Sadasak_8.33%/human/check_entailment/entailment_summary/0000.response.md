Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles multiple test cases by using a loop to iterate over each test case.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k > n`, the program correctly prints `n`.
   - When `k == n`, the program correctly prints `k - 1`.
3. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the frequency of each number in the list `nums` but ensures that no number appears more than `k` times.
   - This function is used correctly in the main program logic.
4. **Output Logic**:
   - If `k` is in the values of the frequency table, it prints `k - 1`.
   - Otherwise, it prints `n`.

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the program logic aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
