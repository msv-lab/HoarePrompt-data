Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has an issue with how it processes the test cases. The function `func_1()` is called without any parameters, which means it relies on input being provided in a specific manner within the function itself. However, the function should accept the necessary parameters to correctly process each test case.

To fix this, the function `func_1()` should be modified to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`. Here's the corrected version:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        func_1(n, m, a, b)

def func_1(n, m, a, b):
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
    print(k)
    return
```

This version of the code correctly passes the necessary parameters to `func_1()` and should work as expected according to the problem description.
