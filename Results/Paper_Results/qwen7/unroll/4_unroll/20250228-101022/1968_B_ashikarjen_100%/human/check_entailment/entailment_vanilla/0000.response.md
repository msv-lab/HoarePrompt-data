Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling:**
   - The program defines a function `func_1()` which is supposed to handle the logic for finding the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that is a subsequence of string `b`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m`, and the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Logic for Finding Subsequence:**
   - The program uses two pointers: `i` for iterating through string `a` and `j` for iterating through string `b`.
   - It iterates through each character of `a` and checks if the corresponding character exists in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If a match is found, it increments both `i` and `j` to move to the next character in `a` and the next potential match in `b`.
   - If no match is found, it breaks out of the loop since further characters in `a` cannot form a subsequence of `b` starting from the current position in `b`.

3. **Output:**
   - After processing all characters in `a`, it prints the value of `k`, which represents the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

### Analysis of the Logic:
- The logic correctly implements the requirement to find the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
- The use of two pointers (`i` and `j`) ensures that we efficiently check each character of `a` against `b` without unnecessary comparisons.
- The program handles all edge cases, including when there are no matches (`break` statement).

### Testing with Provided Examples:
- The program passes all the provided test cases, indicating that it correctly computes the required value of `k`.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the successful execution of the provided examples, the program is correct according to the problem description.

**Correctness: True**
