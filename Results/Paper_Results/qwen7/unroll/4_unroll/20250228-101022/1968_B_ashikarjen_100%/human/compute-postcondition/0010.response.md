Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but reads input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from standard input. It returns `m` as `j`, `t` as an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` as a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` as a string obtained from the next input, and `k` as 0.**
