#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5. a is a binary string of length n, and b is a binary string of length m. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5, and similarly, the sum of all m values does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    k = 0
    j = 0
    for i in range(n):
        while j < m and b[j] != a[i]:
            j += 1
        
        if j < m:
            k += 1
            j += 1
        else:
            break
        
    #State: Output State: `j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop runs for each character in the string `n`. For each iteration, it searches for the current character of `n` in the string `b`. If found, it increments `k` and `j`. If not found before the end of `b`, it breaks out of the loop. Since the problem does not specify any particular values for `n` and `b`, we can only say that `j` will be equal to `m` (length of `b`) after the loop finishes, assuming no matches were found and the loop broke. Other variables (`t`, `n`, `b`, `k`) remain unchanged.
    print(k)
    #This is printed: k (where k is the count of characters in n that are also present in b)
    return
    #`j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` from standard input. It then iterates through each character in `n` and checks if it exists in `b`. For each match found, it increments a counter `k`. After processing all characters in `n`, it prints the value of `k` and returns the values of `t`, `n`, `b`, and `k` as specified in the return postconditions.
