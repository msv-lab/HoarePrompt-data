Output State: **`j` is `m`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a string obtained from the first space-separated integer input, `b` is a string obtained from the next input, `k` is 0**

This means that after the loop runs through each character in the string `n` and checks if it exists in the string `b`, the variable `j` remains equal to the length of `b` (`m`), `t` remains unchanged within its specified range, `n` and `b` retain their original values, and `k` remains 0 since no matches were found and the loop broke without incrementing `k`.
