Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
3. It then reads the strings `a` and `b`.
4. The main logic is implemented in the `func_1()` function:
   - It initializes `k` to 0 and `j` to 0.
   - It iterates through each character of `a`.
   - For each character of `a`, it searches for the same character in `b` starting from the current position `j`.
   - If the character is found, it increments `k` and moves to the next character in `b` (i.e., `j += 1`).
   - If the character is not found before reaching the end of `b`, it breaks the loop.
5. After processing all characters in `a`, it prints the value of `k`, which is the maximum length of the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.

Given the problem statement and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. There are no logical errors or missing steps in the code.

Correctness: **True**
