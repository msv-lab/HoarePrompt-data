You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2

        #State: s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and if x is either 1 or half the length of s, the function continues to check that func_1(s[0:]) is True and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is neither 1 nor half the length of s, the function also ensures that func_1(s[0:]) is True and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True.
    #State: s is an input string, n is the length of the input string s, x is the index of the first character in s that is different from the first character of s, and func_1(s[0:]) is True. If func_1(s[x + 1:]) evaluates to False, the function continues to ensure that func_1(s[0:]) is True and func_1(s[x + 1:]) is True. If x is either 1 or half the length of s, the function checks that both func_1(s[0:]) and func_1(s[x + 1:]) are True. Otherwise, the function also ensures that both func_1(s[0:]) and func_1(s[x + 1:]) are True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an input string `s` and checks if there is a specific pattern within the string based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, it prints 'YES' followed by either 1 or 2 and the relevant substrings of `s`. If the conditions are not met, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any value.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings when the entire string itself is a palindrome but can be split into smaller non-palindromic substrings.

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
test
```

Expected output:
```
YES
2
te st
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
```

This happens because the program checks if the entire string is a palindrome and only considers splitting the string if it is not. In the case of "test," the program incorrectly determines that the string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, even though it can be split into "te" and "st."

To fix this, the program should check for smaller non-palindromic substrings instead of just checking the entire string. Here's a revised version of the `func_2` function that addresses this issue:

```python
def func_2():
    s = input().strip()
    (n, x) = (len(s), -1)
    
    # Check if the entire string is a palindrome
    if func_1(s) == False:
        print('YES')
        print(1)
        print(s)
        return
    
    # Try to find a non-palindromic substring
    for i in range(1, n):
        if func_1(s[:i]) == False or func_1(s[i:]) == False:
            x = i
            break
    
    if x == -1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(2)
        print(s[:x], ' ', s[x:])
```

This revised function checks for non-palindromic substrings by examining both the prefix and suffix of the string for each possible split point.
