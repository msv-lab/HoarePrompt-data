Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed during each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the program reads three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(m\) from the input. If \(m\) is less than either \(a\) or \(b\), it prints 2. Otherwise, it prints the result of \(\frac{m}{a} + \frac{m}{b} + 2\). The total output state will be a list of these printed integers, one for each iteration of the loop.
