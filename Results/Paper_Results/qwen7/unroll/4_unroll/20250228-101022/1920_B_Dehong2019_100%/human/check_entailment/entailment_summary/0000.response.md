Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases, \( t \).
2. For each test case, it reads the values of \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and the array \( a \).
3. The array \( a \) is sorted in descending order.
4. It initializes `ans1` as the sum of all elements in the array.
5. It then iteratively adjusts `ans1` by removing the smallest \( x \) elements twice (effectively subtracting them once) and then adding back the smallest \( k \) elements while subtracting the corresponding \( x \)-th elements twice.
6. It keeps track of the maximum value of `ans1` during this process, which is stored in `ans2`.
7. Finally, it prints `ans2`, which represents the optimal sum of the array after both players make their moves.

Given the logic and the steps outlined in the program, it appears that the program is designed to handle the problem correctly according to the rules and constraints provided. The approach taken by the program aligns with the optimal strategy described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
