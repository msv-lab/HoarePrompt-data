### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - Initializing `mn` to 100 is unnecessary and can be removed. This variable is not used in the logic and could be omitted without affecting the program's functionality.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The loop iterates `q` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
   - The conditions to check whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair.
   - The condition `if a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak.
   - However, the order of these conditions is problematic. The second condition `if a < b > c:` should come after the first condition `if a < b < c`. If both conditions are checked in the same loop iteration, the second condition might be evaluated before the first one, leading to incorrect results.

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correctly printed according to the conditions, but the order of the conditions needs to be fixed.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is correct.
- The order of the conditions in the loop is incorrect, which could lead to incorrect outputs.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because the order of the conditions in the loop is wrong. The second condition should be checked only if the first condition is not met.

### Response:
Reasoning: The order of the conditions in the loop is incorrect, leading to potential incorrect outputs. The second condition should be checked only if the first condition is not met.
Final: **False**
