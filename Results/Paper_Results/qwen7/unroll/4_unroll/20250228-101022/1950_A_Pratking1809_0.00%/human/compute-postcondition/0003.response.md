Output State: **The output state will consist of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the input values. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the input provided during each iteration. Since the exact inputs are not specified, the output will be a series of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' lines corresponding to the conditions met in each iteration.**
