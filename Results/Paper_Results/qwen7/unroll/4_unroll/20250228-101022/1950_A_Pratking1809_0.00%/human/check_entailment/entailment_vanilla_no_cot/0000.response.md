Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has a logical error in how it processes multiple test cases. The variables `mn`, `a`, `b`, and `c` should be re-initialized inside the loop for each test case. Currently, these variables retain their values from the previous iteration, leading to incorrect results for multiple test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')

func()
```

This corrected version initializes `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case within the loop, ensuring that the logic is applied correctly to each set of inputs independently.
