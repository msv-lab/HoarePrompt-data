### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - Initializing `mn` to 100 is unnecessary and can be removed.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The loop iterates `q` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
   - The conditions to check whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair.
   - The condition `if a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak.
   - However, there is a logical issue with the second condition. The correct condition should be `if a < b and b > c:` to ensure that both conditions are checked sequentially.

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correctly printed according to the conditions, but the second condition is incorrectly written.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is almost correct, but the second condition is incorrectly written.
- The current implementation will not correctly identify some cases where a peak should be identified.

### Example:
Consider the test case `3 4 1`. According to the problem description, this should be a peak because `3 < 4 > 1`. However, the current code will not correctly identify this as a peak because the condition `a < b > c` is incorrectly written.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def func():
    q = int(input())
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        elif a < b and b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the logical error in the peak condition.

### Response:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
