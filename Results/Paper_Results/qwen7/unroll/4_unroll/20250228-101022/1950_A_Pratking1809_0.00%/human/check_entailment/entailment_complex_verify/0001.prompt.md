You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given three digits a , b , and c . Determine whether they form a
stair, a peak, or neither.

  * A stair satisfies the condition a<b<c . 
  * A peak satisfies the condition a<b>c . 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits a , b , c (0 \leq a , b
, c \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output "STAIR" if the digits form a stair, "PEAK" if the
digits form a peak, and "NONE" otherwise (output the strings without quotes).

Example

Input

    7
    
    1 2 3
    
    3 2 1
    
    1 5 3
    
    3 4 1
    
    0 0 0
    
    4 1 7
    
    4 5 7

Output

    STAIR
    NONE
    PEAK
    PEAK
    NONE
    NONE
    STAIR

- Program: 
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        (a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, a, b, and c are integers such that 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 9.
def func():
    q = int(input())
    mn = 100
    for i in range(q):
        a, b, c = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a < b < c:
            print('STAIR')
        
        if a < b > c:
            print('PEAK')
        else:
            print('NONE')
        
    #State: The output state will consist of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' printed for each iteration of the loop based on the input values. The specific sequence of these outputs depends on the input provided during each iteration. Since the exact inputs are not specified, the output will be a series of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' lines corresponding to the conditions met in each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if true; if \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, followed by the values for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' lines corresponding to the conditions met in each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - It initializes `mn` to 100, which is not used in the logic and can be removed.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The loop iterates `q` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
   - The conditions to check whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair.
   - The condition `if a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correctly printed according to the conditions.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is correct.
- There are no logical errors in the code.
- The code handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
