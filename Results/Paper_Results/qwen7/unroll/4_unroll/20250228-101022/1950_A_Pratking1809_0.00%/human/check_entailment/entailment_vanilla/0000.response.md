### Reasoning:

1. **Function Definition and Input Handling**:
   - The function `func()` correctly reads the number of test cases `q` from the input.
   - It initializes `mn` to 100, which is not used in the logic and can be removed.

2. **Loop Through Test Cases**:
   - The loop iterates `q` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` for each test case.
   - The conditions to check whether the digits form a stair or a peak are correctly implemented.

3. **Conditions for Stair and Peak**:
   - The condition `if a < b < c:` checks if the digits form a stair.
   - The condition `if a < b > c:` checks if the digits form a peak.
   - If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

4. **Output**:
   - The output for each test case is correctly printed according to the conditions.

### Analysis:
- The logic for determining whether the digits form a stair or a peak is correct.
- There are no logical errors in the code.
- The code handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the provided problem description.

### Response:
Correctness: **True**
