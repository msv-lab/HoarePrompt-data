The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). For each test case, it checks if \(a < b < c\) and prints 'STAIR' if true; if \(a < b > c\), it prints 'PEAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NONE'. The function reads the number of test cases from the first input, followed by the values for each test case. After processing all test cases, it outputs a series of 'STAIR', 'PEAK', or 'NONE' lines corresponding to the conditions met in each test case.
