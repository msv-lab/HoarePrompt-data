Output State: **`t` is an input integer representing the number of test cases.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state defines `t` as a positive integer representing the number of test cases, after executing the code, `t` is now explicitly set to the input integer. All other variables (`n`, `a`, `b`) remain undefined or unspecified until further input or assignments are made.
