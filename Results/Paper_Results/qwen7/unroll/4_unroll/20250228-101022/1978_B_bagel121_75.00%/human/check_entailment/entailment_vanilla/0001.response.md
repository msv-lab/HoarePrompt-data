### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price `a` would yield the highest profit since the modified price `b` is lower than or equal to `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
     - `b - a + 1` ensures that the modified price is not negative.
     - `min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the total number of buns available.
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - The sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` terms is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `p2 = (n - k) * a` to the profit.
   - The total profit is then `ans + p2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions. It handles both the base case where `a >= b` and the more complex case where `a < b` by calculating the optimal `k` and using the appropriate formulas.

### Correctness:
**True**
