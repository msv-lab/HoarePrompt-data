Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the relationship between \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \). If \( a \geq b \), it prints \( n \times a \). Otherwise, it calculates and prints the sum of an arithmetic sequence and a linear sequence.**
