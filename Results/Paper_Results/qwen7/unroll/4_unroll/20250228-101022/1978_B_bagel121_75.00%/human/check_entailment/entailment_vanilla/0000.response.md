Let's reason through the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Reading:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case Handling:**
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program directly calculates the profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price `a` would yield the highest profit in this scenario.

3. **Optimal Strategy Calculation:**
   - If `a` is less than `b`, the program calculates the optimal number of buns `k` to sell at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` where `1 <= i <= k`.
   - The value of `k` is determined as `min(b - a + 1, n)`. This ensures that `k` does not exceed the total number of buns `n` and also does not exceed the difference between `b` and `a` plus one.
   - The profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified prices is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)`.
   - The profit from selling the remaining `n - k` buns at the usual price `a` is calculated as `p2 = (n - k) * a`.
   - The total profit is then `ans + p2`.

### Verification with Examples:

1. **First Test Case:**
   - Input: `4 4 5`
   - `a = 4`, `b = 5`, `n = 4`
   - Since `a < b`, we calculate `k = min(5 - 4 + 1, 4) = 1`.
   - Profit from first `k` buns: `ans = int((5 + (5 - 1 + 1)) / 2 * 1) = 5`.
   - Profit from remaining buns: `p2 = (4 - 1) * 4 = 12`.
   - Total profit: `5 + 12 = 17`.

2. **Second Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 9`
   - `a = 5`, `b = 9`, `n = 5`
   - Since `a < b`, we calculate `k = min(9 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
   - Profit from first `k` buns: `ans = int((9 + (9 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = 35`.
   - Profit from remaining buns: `p2 = (5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
   - Total profit: `35 + 0 = 35`.

3. **Third Test Case:**
   - Input: `10 10 5`
   - `a = 10`, `b = 5`, `n = 10`
   - Since `a > b`, the profit is `10 * 10 = 100`.

4. **Fourth Test Case:**
   - Input: `5 5 11`
   - `a = 5`, `b = 11`, `n = 5`
   - Since `a < b`, we calculate `k = min(11 - 5 + 1, 5) = 5`.
   - Profit from first `k` buns: `ans = int((11 + (11 - 5 + 1)) / 2 * 5) = 45`.
   - Profit from remaining buns: `p2 = (5 - 5) * 5 = 0`.
   - Total profit: `45 + 0 = 45`.

5. **Large Values Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1000000000`
   - `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1000000000`, `n = 1000000000`
   - Since `a = b`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

6. **Edge Case Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000000000 1000000000 1`
   - `a = 1000000000`, `b = 1`, `n = 1000000000`
   - Since `a > b`, the profit is `1000000000 * 1000000000 = 1000000000000000000`.

7. **Another Edge Case Test Case:**
   - Input: `1000 1 1000`
   - `a = 1`, `b = 1000`, `n = 1000`
   - Since `a < b`, we calculate `k = min(1000 - 1 + 1, 1000) = 1000`.
   - Profit from first `k` buns: `ans = int((1000 + (1000 - 1000 + 1)) / 2 * 1000) = 500500`.
   - Profit from remaining buns: `p2 = (1000 - 1000) * 1 = 0`.
   - Total profit: `500500 + 0 = 500500`.
