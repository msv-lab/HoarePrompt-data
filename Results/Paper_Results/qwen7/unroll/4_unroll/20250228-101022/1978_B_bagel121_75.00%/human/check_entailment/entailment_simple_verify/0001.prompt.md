You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17

    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if a >= b:
            print(n * a)
        else:
            k = min(b - a + 1, n)
            ans = int((b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k)
            p2 = (n - k) * a
            print(ans + p2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of lines, each containing the result of one iteration of the loop. For each test case, if `a >= b`, it will print `n * a`. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `ans + p2` where `ans` is the sum of an arithmetic sequence and `p2` is the sum of `a` repeated for the remaining elements.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: 
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.

2. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `a >= b`, the program correctly calculates the profit as `n * a`. This is because selling all buns at the usual price `a` would yield the highest profit since the modified price `b` is lower than or equal to `a`.

3. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - If `a < b`, the program calculates the optimal value of `k` as `min(b - a + 1, n)`.
     - `b - a + 1` ensures that the modified price is not negative.
     - `min(b - a + 1, n)` ensures that `k` does not exceed the total number of buns available.
   - It then calculates the profit from selling the first `k` buns at the modified price `(b - i + 1)` for each `i` from 1 to `k`.
   - The sum of the arithmetic series for the first `k` terms is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `ans = (b + (b - k + 1)) / 2 * k`.
   - The remaining `n - k` buns are sold at the usual price `a`, contributing `p2 = (n - k) * a` to the profit.
   - The total profit is then `ans + p2`.

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints the calculated profit for each test case.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit based on the given conditions. It handles both the base case where `a >= b` and the more complex case where `a < b` by calculating the optimal `k` and using the appropriate formulas.

### Correctness:
**True**
