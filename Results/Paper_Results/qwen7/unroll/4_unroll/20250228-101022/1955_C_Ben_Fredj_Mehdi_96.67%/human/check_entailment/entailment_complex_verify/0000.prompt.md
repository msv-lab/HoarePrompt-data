You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
n ships set out to explore the depths of the ocean. The ships are numbered
from 1 to n and follow each other in ascending order; the i -th ship has a
durability of a_i .

The Kraken attacked the ships k times in a specific order. First, it attacks
the first of the ships, then the last, then the first again, and so on.

Each attack by the Kraken reduces the durability of the ship by 1 . When the
durability of the ship drops to 0 , it sinks and is no longer subjected to
attacks (thus the ship ceases to be the first or last, and the Kraken only
attacks the ships that have not yet sunk). If all the ships have sunk, the
Kraken has nothing to attack and it swims away.

For example, if n=4 , k=5 , and a=[1, 2, 4, 3] , the following will happen:

  1. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [2, 4, 3] ; 
  2. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [2, 4, 2] ; 
  3. The Kraken attacks the first ship, now a = [1, 4, 2] ; 
  4. The Kraken attacks the last ship, now a = [1, 4, 1] ; 
  5. The Kraken attacks the first ship, its durability becomes zero and now a = [4, 1] . 

How many ships were sunk after the Kraken's attack?

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le k \le 10^{15} ) — the number of ships and how many times
the Kraken will attack the ships.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the durability of the ships.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the number of ships sunk by the Kraken on a
separate line.

    #State: Output State: The output state depends on the input values provided in each iteration of the loop. Since the problem does not specify the exact input values for `t`, `a`, `n`, and `k` for each iteration, it's impossible to provide a specific output state without additional information. Each iteration of the loop processes the input values according to the conditions specified and prints the result. The final output state will be a series of printed results from each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of a list of ship durabilities (a), the number of ships (n), and a threshold value (k). Based on the given conditions and constraints, it prints the count of ships whose durability reaches zero after performing certain operations. If the threshold value (k) matches specific predefined values, it directly prints a pre-determined result. Otherwise, it iteratively reduces the durability of ships from both ends until the threshold is met or exceeded, then prints the count of ships with zero durability.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the general case correctly. Specifically, it includes several hardcoded conditions that check for specific values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the elements of the list `a`. These hardcoded conditions do not cover all possible inputs and can lead to incorrect results for other cases.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
1
3 10
1 2 3
```
- Expected Output:
```
3
```
- Program Output:
```
2
```

The program incorrectly handles this case because it does not properly simulate the Kraken's attacks over multiple iterations. The program should continue attacking the first and last ships until their durability reaches zero, but it stops after a fixed number of hardcoded conditions are met. This leads to an incorrect count of sunk ships.

To fix this, the program needs to dynamically simulate the attacks without relying on hardcoded conditions.
