Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `nums`. `n` is a positive integer indicating the length of the list `nums`, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `nums` is a list of `n` integers. The function returns either the value of `n` or the count of indices `i` for which the sum of the first `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to the ceiling of `k / 2` or the sum of the last `i+1` elements in `nums` is less than or equal to the floor division of `k` by 2.**
