Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem but contains a logical error in the `func_1` function. Specifically, the logic for counting the number of ships that sink is flawed. Here’s why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Counting Sunk Ships:**
   - The current implementation of `func_1` tries to simulate the attack pattern by calculating the cumulative sums from both ends of the list (`s_a` and `s_b`). However, this approach does not correctly simulate the actual sinking process.
   - The function incorrectly increments `ans` every time the cumulative sum from either end is less than or equal to the corresponding attack count (`a` or `b`). This leads to an overcount of ships that sink.

2. **Sinking Process Simulation:**
   - The problem requires simulating the Kraken's attacks in a specific alternating pattern (first ship, last ship, repeat).
   - The program should keep track of which ships are still in the game (i.e., not sunk) and apply the attacks accordingly.

### Corrected Approach:
To correctly simulate the sinking process, we need to maintain a queue of ships and apply the attacks in the specified order. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import deque

T = int(input())
for _ in range(T):
    (n, k) = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    nums = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    ships = deque(range(1, n + 1))
    sunk = 0

    while k > 0 and len(ships) > 0:
        if k % 2 == 1:  # Attack the first ship
            if nums[ships[0] - 1] > 0:
                nums[ships[0] - 1] -= 1
                if nums[ships[0] - 1] == 0:
                    sunk += 1
                    ships.popleft()
            k -= 1
        else:  # Attack the last ship
            if nums[ships[-1] - 1] > 0:
                nums[ships[-1] - 1] -= 1
                if nums[ships[-1] - 1] == 0:
                    sunk += 1
                    ships.pop()
            k -= 1

    print(sunk)
```

This corrected program uses a deque to manage the order of the ships and applies the attacks in the specified alternating pattern. It correctly counts the number of ships that sink based on their durability after each attack.
