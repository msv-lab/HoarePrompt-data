Reasoning:

The provided program attempts to solve the problem by identifying the longest subarray where all elements are the same and then calculating the cost to make all elements of the array equal by changing the rest of the array to match this subarray. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: The program iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. **Identifying Segments**:
   - It initializes `l` to 0 and `r` to `n-1`.
   - It uses two pointers to find the longest segment at the start (`st`) and end (`end`) of the array where all elements are the same.
   - `st` is incremented if consecutive elements are the same starting from index 0.
   - `end` is incremented if consecutive elements are the same starting from the end of the array.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cost**:
   - The cost is calculated as the length of the array minus the maximum of `st` and `end`.
   - If the first and last elements of the array are the same, it adjusts the calculation to ensure the correct minimum cost.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles cases where the entire array is already uniform.
   - It also correctly identifies the longest uniform segments at both ends of the array.

Given the logic and the provided examples, the program appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to make all elements of the array equal by performing the allowed operations. The logic matches the problem statement and the examples provided.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **True**
