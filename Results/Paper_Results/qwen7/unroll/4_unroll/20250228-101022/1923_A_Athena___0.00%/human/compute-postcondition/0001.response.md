State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine the number of iterations.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer because `range(t)` will generate a sequence from 0 to `t-1`.
3. Given the constraint `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the minimum value `t` can take is 1.
4. Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

No other variables or states need adjustment as they are not involved in the loop head.
