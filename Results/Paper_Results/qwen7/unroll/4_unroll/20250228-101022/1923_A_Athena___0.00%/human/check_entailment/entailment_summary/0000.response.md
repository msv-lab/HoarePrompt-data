Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to move chips to the left until they form a single block with no free cells between them, minimizing the number of operations. The program simply removes leading and trailing zeros and counts the remaining zeros, which does not ensure the minimum number of operations.

2. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The program removes leading and trailing zeros but does not simulate moving the chips to the closest free cell to the left.
   - It only counts the number of zeros in the final sequence, which is not relevant to the number of operations needed to form a single block.

3. **Example Analysis**:
   - For the input `8 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0`, the output shows the sequence after removing zeros (`1 1 1 1`) and prints `4` (the count of zeros), which is incorrect because the minimum number of operations required is `1`.
   - Similarly, for other test cases, the program does not reflect the actual minimum number of operations needed.

Given this analysis, the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
