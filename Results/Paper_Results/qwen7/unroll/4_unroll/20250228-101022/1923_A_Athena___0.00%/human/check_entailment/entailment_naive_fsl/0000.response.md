Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. The program removes leading and trailing zeros but does not account for the necessary moves to bring chips closer together.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
4
1 0 1 1
```

The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `2`. Here's why:
- Initially, the cells are `[1, 0, 1, 1]`.
- Moving the chip in the 2nd cell to the 1st cell results in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`.

The program fails to simulate the actual moves needed to bring all chips together. It only removes leading and trailing zeros without considering the operations required to achieve the desired configuration.
