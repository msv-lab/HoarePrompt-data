Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), followed by t test cases. Each test case includes an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a sequence of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n), where each a_i is either 0 or 1. The function returns a result for each test case indicating the presence of at least one chip in the cells.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing an integer n and a sequence of n binary values. For each test case, it checks if there is at least one '1' in the sequence, indicating the presence of a chip. If such a '1' exists, it returns a result for that test case, otherwise, it would indicate the absence of chips.
