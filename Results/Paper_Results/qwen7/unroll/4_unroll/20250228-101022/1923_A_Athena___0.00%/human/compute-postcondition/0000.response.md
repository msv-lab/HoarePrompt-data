Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.**

The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`, the new state of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. The other part of the initial state, which involves `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, is not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `t` now holds the value of the input integer.
