Since the `while` loop is defined as `while True`, it will always execute at least once regardless of the initial state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the program state to ensure that the loop can proceed to its first iteration.

State: **`numbers` is an empty list, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, u and v are integers such that 1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, and the list of integers for the starting node(s) has exactly one element 1 ≤ u_1 ≤ n**
