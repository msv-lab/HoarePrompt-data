Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem description. The program attempts to calculate a sum and perform operations, but it does not actually maximize the sum of the matrix as required. Instead, it seems to be calculating a sum based on a formula that does not relate to the operations described.

To maximize the sum of the matrix, we need to fill the matrix with the values 1 to \( n^2 \) in such a way that each row and each column contains these values exactly once. The program should perform \( n \) type 1 operations and \( n \) type 2 operations to achieve this. However, the current implementation does not do this.

Here is an example to illustrate why the program is incorrect:

For \( n = 2 \):

- The correct operations would be:
  - Type 1 operation on row 1: \([1, 2]\)
  - Type 1 operation on row 2: \([2, 1]\)
  - Type 2 operation on column 1: \([1, 2]\)
  - Type 2 operation on column 2: \([2, 1]\)

This would result in the matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```

The sum of this matrix is \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \).

However, the program outputs:
```
7 4
1 2 1 2
1 1 1 2
2 2 1 2
2 1 1 2
```

This results in a matrix:
```
1 2
2 1
```

But the sum is still \( 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 6 \), which is correct, but the program does not follow the required format of performing exactly 2n operations. More importantly, the program does not demonstrate the ability to maximize the sum as described, and it does not handle the operations as specified in the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
