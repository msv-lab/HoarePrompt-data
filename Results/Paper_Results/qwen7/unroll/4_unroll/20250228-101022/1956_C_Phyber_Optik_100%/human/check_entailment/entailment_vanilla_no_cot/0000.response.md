Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The program calculates `sum` using a formula that does not relate to the operations allowed or the goal of maximizing the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` is not relevant to the problem context.

2. **Operations Description**: The program prints `n + n` operations, but these operations do not align with the allowed operations (Type 1 and Type 2). Instead, it prints the same permutation for both types of operations, which is not correct according to the problem statement. The problem requires specific permutations for each operation to maximize the sum of the matrix.

3. **Permutations**: The program should generate different permutations for each operation to ensure the matrix elements are filled in a way that maximizes the sum. The current implementation does not achieve this.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to generate appropriate permutations for each operation to fill the matrix such that the sum is maximized. The given solution does not follow the required logic to achieve the desired outcome.
