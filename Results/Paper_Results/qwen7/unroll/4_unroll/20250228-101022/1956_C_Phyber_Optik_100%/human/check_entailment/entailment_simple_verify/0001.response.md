### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
   - The maximum sum can be achieved by setting each row and each column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - The program calculates `sum` as \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (i^2 - (i-1)^2) \cdot i \). This simplifies to \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \).
   - The program prints `sum` and `2n` as the maximum sum and the number of operations required.
   - It then performs `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

3. **Verification**:
   - The calculation of `sum` is incorrect. The formula provided does not match the problem's requirements.
   - The program incorrectly assumes that the maximum sum is simply \( 1 + \sum_{i=2}^{n} (2i - 1) \cdot i \), which is not true.
   - The program correctly prints `2n` as the number of operations, but the operations themselves do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

4. **Correct Solution**:
   - To maximize the sum, we need to set each row and each column to the sequence `[1, 2, ..., n]`.
   - We can achieve this by performing `n` Type 1 operations and `n` Type 2 operations, setting each row and column to `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the process of reading `t` and `n`, calculating `sum`, and printing the results.
   - However, the calculation of `sum` is incorrect, and the operations do not maximize the sum of the matrix.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum sum and the operations to achieve it.
   - Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the program is incorrect due to the incorrect calculation of the sum and the operations not maximizing the sum of the matrix.
