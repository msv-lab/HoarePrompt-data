Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation either permutes rows or columns.
2. The provided code attempts to calculate a sum and print it along with some operations, but it does not correctly solve the problem as stated.
3. Specifically, the code initializes `sum` to 1 and then adds a series of terms, which do not correspond to the correct way of permuting rows and columns to maximize the sum.
4. The operations printed (`1`, `n - j + 1`, `*range(1, n + 1)`) and (`2`, `n - j + 1`, `*range(1, n + 1)`) are not relevant to the problem's requirements. These operations do not change the matrix in a way that would maximize its sum.
5. The problem requires setting specific values in the matrix to maximize the sum, not performing arithmetic operations on `n`.

Given these points, the provided code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
