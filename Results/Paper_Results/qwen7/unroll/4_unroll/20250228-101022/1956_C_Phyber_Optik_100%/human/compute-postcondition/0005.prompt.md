You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. Additionally, the sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        sum = 1
        
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            sum += (i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i
        
        print(sum, n + n)
        
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            print(1, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
            print(2, n - j + 1, *range(1, n + 1))
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. For each iteration of the loop, the following operations are performed:
    #
    #1. A new value of `n` is taken as input.
    #2. A variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
    #3. A nested loop calculates `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`.
    #4. The result of `sum` and `n + n` are printed.
    #5. Another nested loop prints two lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, with the first line containing `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line containing `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`.
    #
    #After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `t` and `n` will be the last values provided as input within the loop. The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to an iteration of the loop, showing the calculated `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two lines of printed ranges for each value of `j`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). The sum of n² over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10⁵. For each test case, the function determines and returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
