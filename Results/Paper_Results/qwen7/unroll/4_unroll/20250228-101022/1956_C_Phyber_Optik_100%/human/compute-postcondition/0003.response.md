Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500. For each iteration of the loop, the following operations are performed:

1. A new value of `n` is taken as input.
2. A variable `sum` is initialized to 1.
3. A nested loop calculates `sum` using the formula `(i * i - (i - 1) * (i - 1)) * i` for `i` ranging from 2 to `n`.
4. The result of `sum` and `n + n` are printed.
5. Another nested loop prints two lines for each value of `j` from 1 to `n`, with the first line containing `1`, `n - j + 1`, and a range of numbers from 1 to `n`, and the second line containing `2`, `n - j + 1`, and the same range of numbers from 1 to `n`.

After all iterations of the loop, the final values of `t` and `n` will be the last values provided as input within the loop. The output will consist of multiple lines, each corresponding to an iteration of the loop, showing the calculated `sum` and `n + n`, followed by two lines of printed ranges for each value of `j`.
