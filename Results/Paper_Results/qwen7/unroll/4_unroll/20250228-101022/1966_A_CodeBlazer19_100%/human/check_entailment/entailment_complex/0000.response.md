Reasoning:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by a list of `n` integers representing the cards.

2. **Counting Frequencies**: The program uses a list comprehension to count the occurrences of each unique card number in the list `l`. Specifically, `p = [l.count(j) for j in set(l)]` creates a list of counts for each unique card number.

3. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the maximum count of any card number (`max(p)`) is at least `k`. If this condition is true, it prints `k - 1`. Otherwise, it prints `n`.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly:
   - If the maximum count of any card number is less than `k`, the program correctly prints `n`.
   - If the maximum count of any card number is exactly `k`, the program correctly prints `k - 1`.

5. **Output**: The program outputs the result for each test case as required, ensuring that the minimum number of cards remaining is printed.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
