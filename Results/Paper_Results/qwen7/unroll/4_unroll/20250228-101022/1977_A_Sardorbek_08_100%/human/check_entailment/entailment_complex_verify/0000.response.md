### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the annotated code step-by-step to determine the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Description Analysis**:
   - The goal is to determine if it is possible to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
   - Each move can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube.
   - The parity (odd/even nature) of `n` and `m` must be the same for it to be possible to achieve `m` cubes after `n` moves.

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` (representing `n` and `m` respectively).
   - It then checks the conditions:
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
     - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Conditions Evaluation**:
   - The condition `b == c` correctly identifies if the number of moves and the desired number of cubes are the same, which would mean the answer is 'YES'.
   - The condition `b < c` is incorrect because it should check if it is possible to reach `c` cubes from `b` moves, not just if `b` is less than `c`.
   - The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` is the key condition. This checks if the parity of `b` and `c` is the same, which is necessary but not sufficient. We need to ensure that the difference between `b` and `c` is even (since each move changes the number of cubes by 1).

4. **Correct Conditions**:
   - To correctly determine if it is possible to achieve `c` cubes after `n` moves, we need to check if the difference between `b` and `c` is even.
   - The correct condition should be `abs(b - c) % 2 == 0`.

5. **Original Assessment Re-evaluation**:
   - The original assessment states that the program incorrectly prints 'Yes' when `b % 2 == c % 2`, which is always true for the given examples but fails in other cases.
   - This is correct because the current implementation does not account for the difference between `b` and `c` being even, which is crucial.

6. **Corrected Implementation**:
   - The corrected condition should be:
     ```python
     if abs(b - c) % 2 == 0:
         print('Yes')
     else:
         print('No')
     ```

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is accurate because the current implementation does not correctly handle the condition where the difference between `b` and `c` must be even. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Final: False**
