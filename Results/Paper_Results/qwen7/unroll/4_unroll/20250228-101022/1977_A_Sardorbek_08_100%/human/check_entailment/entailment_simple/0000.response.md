Reasoning:

1. The function `func()` takes an integer `a` as input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. It then iterates over each test case using a for loop where `i` ranges from 0 to `a-1`.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` representing `n` and `m` respectively.
4. The logic inside the loop checks the following conditions:
   - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `b < c`, it prints 'NO'.
   - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The key points to verify the correctness are:
- The condition `b == c` should indeed result in 'YES' because if the number of moves `b` equals the desired number of cubes `c`, Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired result.
- The condition `b < c` should result in 'NO' because if the number of moves is less than the desired number of cubes, it's impossible to build the tower.
- The condition `b % 2 == c % 2` should be true if both `b` and `c` are even or both are odd. This is because each move either adds or removes one cube, meaning the parity (even or odd nature) of the number of cubes should match the parity of the number of moves. If the parities do not match, it's impossible to achieve the desired number of cubes.

Given the conditions, the provided logic correctly handles all scenarios:
- If `b == c`, the tower can be built exactly.
- If `b < c`, it's impossible to build the tower.
- If `b % 2 != c % 2`, it's also impossible to build the tower.

Therefore, the provided logic matches the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**
