Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains either "1" or "n - 1". Specifically, for each iteration of the loop, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, the line will contain "1", otherwise it will contain "n - 1". Here, `t` is the integer input initially provided, and `n` and `k` are determined by the subsequent inputs in each iteration.
