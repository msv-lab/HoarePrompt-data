Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is less than `n-1` correctly. According to the problem description, if `k` is less than `n-1`, Everule can still visit more than just island 1. Specifically, if `k < n-1`, Everule can still visit all islands except possibly one.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

- For the input `4 1`, the program outputs `3`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `4` because even with one bridge destroyed, Everule can still visit all four islands.

The program should check if `k < n-1` and ensure that Everule can visit all islands in such cases. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if k >= n - 1:
            print(1)
        else:
            print(n)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that if `k < n-1`, Everule can still visit all `n` islands.
