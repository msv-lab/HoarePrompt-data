You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5. For each test case, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26, and m is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000. The string s consists of only the first k lowercase English alphabets, and the sum of m and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^6.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        n, k, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt = 0
        
        cur = 0
        
        for ss in s:
            cur_ss = ord(ss) - ord('a')
            if cur & 1 << cur_ss == 0:
                cur += 1 << cur_ss
            if cur == (1 << k) - 1:
                cnt += 1
                cur = 0
        
        if cnt >= n:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
            tmp = ''
            ans = chr(ord('a') + k - 1) * cnt
            for i in range(k):
                if cur & 1 << i == 0:
                    tmp = chr(ord('a') + i)
            ans += tmp
            ans += 'a' * (n - cnt - 1)
            print(ans)
        
    #State: The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least `n` substrings where each substring has exactly `k` distinct characters. If such substrings exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a specific string `ans` constructed based on the bits set in `cur`. The final output is a combination of 'YES'/'NO' and the constructed string `ans` for each input.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes integers t, n, k, m, and a string s. It validates that t is a positive integer within 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5, n and k are positive integers within 1 ≤ n ≤ 26 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 26 respectively, m is a positive integer within 1 ≤ m ≤ 1000, and s consists of the first k lowercase English alphabets. The function also ensures that the sum of m across all test cases does not exceed 10^6.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
