Output State: **The output state depends on the input values provided during each iteration of the loop. For each input, the program processes a string `s` and checks if it contains at least `n` substrings where each substring has exactly `k` distinct characters. If such substrings exist, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO' followed by a specific string `ans` constructed based on the bits set in `cur`. The final output is a combination of 'YES'/'NO' and the constructed string `ans` for each input.**
