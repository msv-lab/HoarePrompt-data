Output: **NO**

Explanation: 
- The `index` variable is explicitly given as 6.
- The variable `t` is an integer value from `data[0]`, but its specific value is not provided, so it does not affect the output of the `print` statement.
- The `results` list contains strings 'YES' or 'NO'. Since no other information about the contents of `results` is provided, we cannot determine the exact content of `results`. However, the `print` statement uses `'\n'.join(results)`, which joins all elements of the `results` list into a single string with each element separated by a newline character (`\n`). Given the initial state, if `results` contains any 'NO', the output will be 'NO'. If `results` only contains 'YES', the output would be 'YES', but since no 'YES' is mentioned, the output is 'NO'.
