Reasoning:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Incorrect Check for Uniformity**: The solution checks if the first row (`first_row`) or the last row (`last_row`) is uniform and different from the other rows. However, this does not cover all scenarios where the grid can be made uniform. For instance, a grid where all rows are the same but differ from the columns would not be caught by this check.

2. **Missing Consideration of Columns**: The solution does not check if all columns can be made uniform, which is a critical part of the problem. A grid can still be made uniform even if the rows are not uniform, as long as the columns can be made uniform through the allowed operations.

3. **Insufficient Conditions**: The current logic only covers specific cases where the first or last row is uniform and different from others. It fails to handle more general cases where the grid can be made uniform through a combination of row and column operations.

To properly solve this problem, one should consider the following approach:
- Check if all rows are the same.
- Check if all columns are the same.
- If neither condition is met, then it is generally possible to make the grid uniform by performing the allowed operations (since the grid is small enough to allow such transformations).

Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = [input() for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Check if all rows are the same
        all_rows_same = all(row == a[0] for row in a)
        
        # Check if all columns are the same
        all_columns_same = all(all(a[i][j] == a[0][0] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m))
        
        if all_rows_same or all_columns_same:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

# Example usage:
# func()
```

Given this analysis, the original function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
