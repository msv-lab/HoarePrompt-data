Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the problem. The program checks only the first row and the last row for uniformity and whether they are different. However, this approach is insufficient because it does not consider other rows and columns.

To illustrate, consider the following grid:

```
3 4
BWBW
WBWB
BWBW
```

According to the problem description, it is possible to make all squares the same color through a series of operations. However, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because the first row ("BWBW") and the last row ("BWBW") are the same, and they are not different from each other.

A correct solution would involve checking all rows and columns to ensure that either all rows or all columns are uniform. The provided program fails to do this comprehensive check.
