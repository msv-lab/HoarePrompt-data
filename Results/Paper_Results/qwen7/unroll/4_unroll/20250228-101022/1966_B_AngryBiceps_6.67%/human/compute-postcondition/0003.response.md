Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid of size n x m where n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 500. The grid contains cells with either 'W' or 'B'. For each test case, identified by a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), the function evaluates the grid and returns a result based on predefined conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each involving a grid of specified dimensions filled with 'W' and 'B'. The function processes these grids according to certain rules but does not accept any parameters directly within its definition; instead, it likely takes these inputs from an external source or through other means not shown here.
