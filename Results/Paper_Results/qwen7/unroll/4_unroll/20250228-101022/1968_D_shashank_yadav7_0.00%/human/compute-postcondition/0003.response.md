Output State: The output state depends on the input values for each iteration of the loop. For each input set, the output will either be 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison between `bm` and `sm`. Since the input values are not specified, the final output state cannot be determined precisely without knowing the specific inputs. However, it will consist of a sequence of 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' outputs corresponding to each input set provided.
