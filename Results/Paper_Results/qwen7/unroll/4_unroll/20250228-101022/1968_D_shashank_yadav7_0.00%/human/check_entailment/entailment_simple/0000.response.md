Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the necessary inputs: `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, the permutation `p`, and the array `a`.
3. It adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.
4. It initializes `bm` and `sm` to represent the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
5. The program then iterates through up to `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players. It uses the maximum possible score for each turn, considering the possibility of staying at the current position or moving to the new position based on the permutation.
6. After the loop, it compares the final scores and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to follow the rules of the game correctly and should produce the expected output for any valid input within the constraints provided.

Correctness: **True**
