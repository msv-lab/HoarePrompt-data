Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two binary strings \(d\) and \(e\), and determines the smallest index \(k\) in string \(d\) such that the substring of \(d\) starting from index \(k\) matches any substring of \(e\). It prints \(k\) for each test case. The function effectively finds the earliest matching position of any substring of \(d\) within \(e\) for each test case.**
