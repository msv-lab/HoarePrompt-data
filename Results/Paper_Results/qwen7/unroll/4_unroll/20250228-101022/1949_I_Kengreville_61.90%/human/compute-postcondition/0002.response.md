Output State: **`nodes` is a list containing the integer `i`, `n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited or not with `visited[i]` set to `True`, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of floats initialized to `None`.**

In this case, the code `nodes.append(i)` adds the integer `i` to the list `nodes`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
