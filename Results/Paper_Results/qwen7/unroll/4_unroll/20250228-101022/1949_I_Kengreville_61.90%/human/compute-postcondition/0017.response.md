Postcondition: **`nodes` is an empty list, `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0` if the corresponding node was not visited or `0` otherwise, `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input, `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited or `False` otherwise, `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding node was visited or `None` otherwise, `ok` is `False`.**
