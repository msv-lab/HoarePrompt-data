Based on the initial state provided:

- `nodes` is an empty list.
- `coef0` is a list of length `n` where each element is `0`.
- `x` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input.
- `y` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input.
- `r` is a list of length `n` where each element is an integer read from input.
- `visited` is a list of length `n` where each element is `True` if the corresponding node was visited or `False` otherwise.
- `coef1` is a list of length `n` where each element is `1` if the corresponding node was visited or `None` otherwise.
- `ok` is `True` if at least one node had `coef1` equal to `1` and `c1` not equal to `0` during any iteration of the loop, otherwise `False`. The condition `ok` is true.

The `print('YES')` statement will simply print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
