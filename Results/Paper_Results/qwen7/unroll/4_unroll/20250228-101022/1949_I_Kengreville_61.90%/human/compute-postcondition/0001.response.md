Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of disks, `x` is a list of integers representing the x-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `y` is a list of integers representing the y-coordinates of the centers of the disks, `r` is a list of integers representing the radii of the disks, `visited` is a list of boolean values indicating whether each disk has been visited or not with `visited[i]` set to `True`, and `coef0` and `coef1` are lists of floats initialized to `None`.**

The code `visited[i] = True` sets the `i`-th element of the `visited` list to `True`, indicating that the `i`-th disk has now been visited. All other variables and their values remain unchanged from the initial state.
