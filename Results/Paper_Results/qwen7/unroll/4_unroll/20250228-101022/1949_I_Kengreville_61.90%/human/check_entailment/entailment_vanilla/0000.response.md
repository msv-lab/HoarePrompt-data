Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to check if we can adjust the radii of the disks so that:
   - Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent.
   - No two disks overlap.
   - The sum of all radii strictly decreases.

2. **Graph Representation**: The problem can be modeled using a graph where each disk is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if the corresponding disks are tangent. The goal is to find a way to decrease the radii of some disks while keeping the tangency conditions and ensuring no overlap.

3. **DFS and Coefficients**:
   - The `dfs` function is used to explore the graph and calculate coefficients (`coef0` and `coef1`) for each node.
   - `coef0` and `coef1` represent linear combinations of the original radii and the new radii, respectively.
   - If the sum of `coef1` for a connected component is non-zero, it means we can decrease the sum of radii in that component.

4. **Checking Conditions**:
   - For each disk, if it hasn't been visited, we start a DFS from that disk.
   - During DFS, we update the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - After exploring all connected components, if any component has a non-zero sum of `coef1`, it means we can decrease the total radius of that component.

5. **Output**:
   - If any connected component allows a reduction in the sum of radii, we print "YES".
   - Otherwise, we print "NO".

6. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code correctly initializes the necessary variables and processes the input.
   - The `dfs` function correctly updates the coefficients based on the tangency condition.
   - The main logic checks if any connected component allows a reduction in the sum of radii.

Given this analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
