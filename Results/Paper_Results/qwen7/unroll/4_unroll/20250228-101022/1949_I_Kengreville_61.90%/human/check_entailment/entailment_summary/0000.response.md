Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that the logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem statement and examples provided.

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - We need to check if it's possible to decrease the radii of some disks while keeping the tangency conditions and ensuring no overlap, and also decreasing the total sum of radii.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **func_1()**: This function reads the input and initializes necessary lists. It then iterates over each disk, performing a DFS starting from unvisited disks. The DFS updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values for disks that are tangent to the current disk. The key logic here is checking if any disk has a non-zero `coef1` value after the DFS, which indicates that it's possible to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total sum.
   - **dfs()**: This function performs a DFS on the graph formed by the disks. It updates the `coef0` and `coef1` values for disks that are tangent to the current disk. The `coef0` and `coef1` values are used to represent the relationship between the radii of the disks and their tangency.

3. **Example Verification**:
   - For the first example, the program correctly identifies that it's possible to decrease the radii of some disks while maintaining tangency and reducing the total sum.
   - For the second example, the program correctly identifies that it's not possible to decrease the radii while maintaining tangency and reducing the total sum.

Given the analysis, the functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. They handle the DFS traversal, update the necessary coefficients, and check the conditions for the possibility of decreasing the radii.

Correctness: **True**
