You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given n disks in the plane. The center of each disk has integer
coordinates, and the radius of each disk is a positive integer. No two disks
overlap in a region of positive area, but it is possible for disks to be
tangent to each other.

Your task is to determine whether it is possible to change the radii of the
disks in such a way that:

  * Disks that were tangent to each other remain tangent to each other. 
  * No two disks overlap in a region of positive area. 
  * The sum of all radii strictly decreases. 

The new radii are allowed to be arbitrary positive real numbers. The centers
of the disks cannot be changed.

Input

The first line contains an integer n (1\le n \le 1000 ) — the number of disks.

The next n lines contain three integers each. The i -th of such lines contains
x_i , y_i (-10^9 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9 ), and r_i (1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9 ) —
the coordinates of the center, and the radius, of the i -th disk.

Output

Print \texttt{YES} if it is possible to change the radii in the desired
manner. Otherwise, print \texttt{NO} .

Examples

    0 2 1
    
    0 0 1
    
    4 -3 4
    
    11 0 3
    
    11 5 2

Output

    YES
    
Input

    2 2 2
    
    7 2 3
    
    7 7 2
    
    2 7 3

Output

    NO
    
Note

In the first sample, one can decrease the radii of the first and third disk by
0.5 , and increase the radius of the second disk by 0.5 . This way, the sum of
all radii decreases by 0.5 . The situation before and after changing the radii
is depicted below.

In the second sample, depicted below, there is no way to change the radii of
the disks in the desired manner.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    x = [None] * n
    y = [None] * n
    r = [None] * n
    visited = [False] * n
    coef0 = [None] * n
    coef1 = [None] * n
    nodes = []
    for i in range(n):
        (x[i], y[i], r[i]) = map(int, input().split())

    ok = False
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            coef0[i] = 0
            coef1[i] = 1
            nodes = []
            dfs(i)
            c0 = 0
            c1 = 0
            for j in nodes:
                c0 += coef0[j]
                c1 += coef1[j]
            ok = ok or c1 != 0
    if ok:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')

#Function 2:
def dfs(i):
    if not visited[i]:
        visited[i] = True
        nodes.append(i)
        for j in range(n):
            dx = x[i] - x[j]
            dy = y[i] - y[j]
            if not visited[j] and (r[i] + r[j]) ** 2 == dx ** 2 + dy ** 2:
                coef0[j] = r[i] + r[j] - coef0[i]
                coef1[j] = -coef1[i]
                dfs(j)



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function performs a depth-first search starting from the disk indexed by `i`. It marks the current disk as visited and updates the `coef0` and `coef1` lists for any unvisited disks that are tangent to the current disk. After the function concludes, all disks that are reachable from the initial disk `i` will have been marked as visited, and the `coef0` and `coef1` lists will be updated for those disks that are tangent to the current disk.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if the radii of the disks can be adjusted as described. Specifically, the program does not properly account for the condition that the sum of all radii must strictly decrease. The `dfs` function only checks for tangency between disks and updates coefficients without ensuring the sum of radii decreases.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4
0 0 2
2 0 2
0 2 2
2 2 2
```

In this case, the disks form a square configuration where each disk is tangent to its adjacent disks. The program would attempt to adjust the radii but does not ensure that the sum of the radii strictly decreases. Since the initial radii are equal and no adjustment can make the sum strictly smaller while maintaining tangency, the program should output "NO" but may incorrectly output "YES" due to the lack of proper validation for the sum condition.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for all potential cases and is thus incorrect.
