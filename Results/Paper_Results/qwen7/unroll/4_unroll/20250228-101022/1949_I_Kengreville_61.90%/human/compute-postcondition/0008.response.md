Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range` function).
   - `n` is a predefined value that determines the number of iterations.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 because the `range(n)` function will generate numbers from 0 to `n-1`. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider other given variables**:
   - The other variables (`nodes`, `coef0`, `x`, `y`, `r`, `visited`, `coef1`) are not part of the loop head and do not affect the loop's execution condition. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this reasoning, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
