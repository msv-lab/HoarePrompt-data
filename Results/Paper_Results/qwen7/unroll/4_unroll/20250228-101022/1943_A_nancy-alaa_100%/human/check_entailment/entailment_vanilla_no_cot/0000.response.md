Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly simulate the game as described. Here’s why:

1. **Game Rules Not Fully Implemented**: The game rules state that Alice can pick any element from `a` and append it to `c`, and Bob can only delete an element. The current implementation does not simulate these turns alternately.

2. **MEX Calculation**: The code attempts to calculate the MEX directly from the counts of elements in `arr`, which doesn't account for the sequence of moves made during the game.

3. **Optimal Strategy**: The optimal strategy involves ensuring that Alice and Bob make moves that affect the MEX value in their favor. The current logic does not consider the alternating turns and the specific conditions under which Alice and Bob should make their moves.

### Correct Approach:
To solve this problem correctly, you need to simulate the game according to the rules and determine the optimal moves for both players. Here’s a more accurate approach:

1. **Simulate the Game**: Track the turns and ensure Alice and Bob make their moves according to the rules.
2. **Track Elements**: Maintain a set of elements picked by Alice and Bob.
3. **Calculate MEX**: Determine the MEX of the elements picked by Alice after the game ends.

Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        # Sets to track elements picked by Alice and Bob
        alice_picked = set()
        bob_picked = set()
        
        # Simulate the game
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 == 0:  # Alice's turn
                # Alice picks the smallest available element
                for j in range(n):
                    if arr[j] not in alice_picked and arr[j] not in bob_picked:
                        alice_picked.add(arr[j])
                        break
            else:  # Bob's turn
                # Bob picks the smallest available element
                for j in range(n):
                    if arr[j] not in alice_picked and arr[j] not in bob_picked:
                        bob_picked.add(arr[j])
                        break
        
        # Calculate MEX
        mex = 0
        while mex in alice_picked:
            mex += 1
        print(mex)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution ensures that the game is simulated correctly according to the rules and calculates the MEX accurately based on the elements picked by Alice.
