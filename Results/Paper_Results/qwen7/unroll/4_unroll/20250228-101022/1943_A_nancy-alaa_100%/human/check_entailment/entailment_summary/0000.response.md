Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the MEX of the array `c` after both players have made their moves optimally.
2. The provided program attempts to find the smallest missing integer or the first integer that appears exactly once in the array. However, it does not simulate the game process correctly.
3. The program does not account for the turns taken by Alice and Bob, nor does it ensure that the elements are appended to `c` in the correct order based on whose turn it is.
4. The logic inside the loop does not properly handle the alternating turns between Alice and Bob and does not construct the array `c` as required.
5. The program fails to consider the strategic aspect of the game where Alice tries to maximize the MEX and Bob tries to minimize it.

Given these points, the provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
