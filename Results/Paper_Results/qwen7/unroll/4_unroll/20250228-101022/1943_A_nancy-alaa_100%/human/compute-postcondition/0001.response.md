Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The variable `mpp` is a dictionary counting the occurrences of each integer in `arr`. The variable `first` is a boolean indicating whether at least one element with a count of 1 has been encountered. After executing the loop, the output consists of either the smallest missing integer in `arr` or the smallest integer with exactly one occurrence in `arr`, provided it was the second unique element found. If no such integer exists, the output will be the smallest integer not present in `arr`.
