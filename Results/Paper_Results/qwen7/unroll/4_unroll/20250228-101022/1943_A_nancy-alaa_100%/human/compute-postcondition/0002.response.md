Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where 0 ≤ a_i < n. The variable `mpp` is a dictionary counting the occurrences of each element in `arr`. The variable `first` is a boolean indicating whether at least one element has been found with a count of 1. After executing the loop, for each test case, the output is either the smallest missing integer or the first integer that appears exactly once (if it's the second unique element encountered), printed when found.
