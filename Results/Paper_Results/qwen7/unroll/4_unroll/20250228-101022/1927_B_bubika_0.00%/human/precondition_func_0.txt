t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the trace a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n for all i, and there exists at least one string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters a-z that matches the given trace.
