Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the trace a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n for all i; the string a is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**.

In this output state, the variable `a` has been updated to the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`, while the other variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the trace `a` remains a list of non-negative integers as described in the initial state.
