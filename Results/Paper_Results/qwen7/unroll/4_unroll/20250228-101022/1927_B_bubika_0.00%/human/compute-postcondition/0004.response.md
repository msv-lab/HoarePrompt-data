Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; the trace a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i < n for all i; the string a is set to 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; b is a list of 26 ones (since each character from 'a' is referenced once per iteration of the inner loop for each input value).**
