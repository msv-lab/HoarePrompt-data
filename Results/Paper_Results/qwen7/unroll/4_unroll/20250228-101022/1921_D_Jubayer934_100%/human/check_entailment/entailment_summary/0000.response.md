Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each one.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
4. It initializes `temp` to `-1` and `ans` as an empty list.
5. It iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and the first `m` elements of `b`, calculating the absolute differences and appending them to `ans`.
6. There is a condition check to see if swapping the assignment of elements from `a` and `b` increases the total difference. If it does, it updates `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
7. If `temp` is not `-1`, it adjusts the remaining elements of `ans` to reflect the swapped assignments.
8. Finally, it prints the sum of the elements in `ans`.

Given the logic and steps, the program seems to follow the problem description accurately. It aims to maximize the total difference by strategically choosing and ordering elements from the two lists. The steps taken to sort and calculate the differences align with the goal of making the arrays as different as possible.

Correctness: **True**
