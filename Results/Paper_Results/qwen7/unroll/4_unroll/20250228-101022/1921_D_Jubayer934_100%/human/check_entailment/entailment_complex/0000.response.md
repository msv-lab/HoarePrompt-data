Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.
3. It sorts `a` in ascending order and `b` in descending order.
4. The program then iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and tries to match them with the appropriate elements from the first `m` elements of `b` to maximize the total difference.
5. The logic inside the loop checks if swapping the current element of `a` with the corresponding element in `b` would increase the difference. If so, it updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.
6. After the loop, if `temp` is not `-1`, it means a swap was made, and the program adjusts the result by appending the necessary differences.
7. Finally, it prints the sum of the differences for each test case.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic seems to correctly follow the strategy of maximizing the total difference \(D\) by strategically choosing and ordering elements from the sorted lists `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **True**
