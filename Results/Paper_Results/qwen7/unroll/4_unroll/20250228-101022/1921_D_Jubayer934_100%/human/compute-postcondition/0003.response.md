Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes integers n and m (with 1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5), and lists a_i and b_i (where 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9). For each test case, it checks if the test case is valid (i.e., 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5). If valid, it performs some unspecified operations on the lists a_i and b_i and returns the result; otherwise, it returns an error message indicating an invalid test case.**
