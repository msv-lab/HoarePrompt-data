Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable involved here is the input value, which determines the number of iterations of the loop.

2. **Determine the State Adjustments Needed**: 
   - The variable `_` is a placeholder used in Python for an unused variable in a loop. It doesn't hold any specific value within the loop itself but is used to indicate that the loop will run for a certain number of times based on the input.
   - The key information needed for the loop to execute correctly is the value of the input, which will determine how many times the loop runs.

3. **Constraints and Conditions**:
   - The value of `t` (the input) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\). This means the loop will run between 1 and 100 times inclusive.
   - The loop will read input values for `n` and `m` for each iteration, and these values must satisfy \(1 \leq n \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop is driven by the input, the state before the loop should reflect the condition that the input will be a valid integer within the specified range.

Therefore, the state before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that the input value is within the valid range.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100**
