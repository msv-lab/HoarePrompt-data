Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Sorting Arrays**: The program sorts the array `a` in ascending order and the array `b` in descending order. This is a good approach to maximize the differences.

3. **Logic for Maximum Difference**: The program iterates through the first `n` elements of `a` and tries to pair each element with the corresponding element in `b` to maximize the difference. It checks if swapping the current pairing with the potential better pairing (based on the difference) would increase the total difference. If it finds a better pairing, it updates the index `temp` and breaks out of the loop.

4. **Constructing the Result Array**: After determining the best initial pairing, the program constructs the result array `ans` by appending the differences between the elements of `a` and the corresponding elements of `b`.

5. **Handling Remaining Elements**: If there was a better initial pairing found (`temp != -1`), the program appends the remaining differences to `ans` using the updated logic.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the sum of the differences stored in `ans`.

Given the problem statement and the annotated program, the logic seems sound and should produce the correct output for the given constraints and examples.

Correctness: **True**
