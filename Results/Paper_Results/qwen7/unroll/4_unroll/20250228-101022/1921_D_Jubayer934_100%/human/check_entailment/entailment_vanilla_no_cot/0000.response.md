Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given solution attempts to solve the problem but contains several issues:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Difference Calculation**: The logic used to decide whether to use `b[i]` or `b[-(n - i)]` is flawed. The goal is to maximize the total difference \(D = \sum_{i=1}^{n} |a_i - c_i|\). The current approach does not guarantee the maximum possible difference.

2. **Unnecessary Complexity**: The code unnecessarily sorts and then partially selects elements from both arrays `a` and `b`. It also uses an intermediate variable `temp` which is not correctly utilized.

3. **Improper Assignment of Values**: The code tries to assign values to `ans` based on a comparison that may not lead to the optimal solution. The condition `if abs(a[i] - b[-(n - i)]) > abs(a[i] - b[i])` is not always correct for maximizing the difference.

### Correct Solution Approach:
To achieve the maximum difference, Vasya should pair the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))

        # Sort both arrays
        a.sort()
        b.sort(reverse=True)

        # Calculate the maximum difference
        max_diff = sum(abs(a[i] - b[i]) for i in range(n))

        print(max_diff)


# Example usage
func()
```

This solution works as follows:
1. **Sort Arrays**: Both arrays `a` and `b` are sorted.
2. **Calculate Differences**: For each element in `a`, calculate the absolute difference with the corresponding element in `b` (after sorting `b` in descending order).
3. **Sum Differences**: Sum these differences to get the maximum possible difference \(D\).

This approach ensures that the differences are maximized by pairing the smallest elements of `a` with the largest elements of `b` and vice versa.
