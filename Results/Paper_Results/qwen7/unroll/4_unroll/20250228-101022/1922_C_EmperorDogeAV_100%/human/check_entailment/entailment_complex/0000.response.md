### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to compute a list where each element represents the cost to move to the closest city from the current city.
   - However, the implementation of `func_1` is flawed. It incorrectly sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1 for all valid indices `i`, regardless of the actual distances. This is because the logic inside the loop does not correctly compare the distances to the previous and next city.
   - The intended behavior should be to set `prog_cities[i]` to 1 if moving forward to the next city is closer, otherwise, it should set it to the absolute difference between the next city and the current city.
   - The current implementation always sets `prog_cities[i]` to 1, which means it assumes moving forward is always the closest city, which is not necessarily true.

2. **Main Program Analysis:**
   - The main program expects `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` to be computed using `func_1`.
   - These lists are then used to calculate the prefix sums (`pref_sum_f` and `pref_sum_b`).
   - The queries are processed using these prefix sums to determine the minimum cost to travel between two cities.
   - However, since `func_1` is incorrect, the values in `forward_cities` and `backward_cities` are incorrect, leading to incorrect results for the prefix sums and, consequently, the queries.

### Conclusion:
Given the flawed implementation of `func_1`, the overall program is incorrect because it relies on incorrect data for calculating the prefix sums and processing the queries.

### Correctness:
**False**
