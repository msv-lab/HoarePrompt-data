Output State: **`times` is an input integer, and the initial state of `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `check` is 2147483647.**

The code assigns the value `2 ** 31 - 1` to the variable `check`. This calculation results in `2147483647`. The values of `times` and `t` remain unchanged from their initial states.
