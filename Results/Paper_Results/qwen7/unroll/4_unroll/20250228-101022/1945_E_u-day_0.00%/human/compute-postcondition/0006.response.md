Output State: **`low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1`; `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`.**

Explanation: The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, setting `low` to 0 and `high` to `n - 1`. This sets up the boundaries for a binary search algorithm, but does not affect the value of `pos`, which remains unchanged from its initial state.
