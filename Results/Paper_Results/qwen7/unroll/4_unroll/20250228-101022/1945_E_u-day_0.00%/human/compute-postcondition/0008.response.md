Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head condition is `low + 1 < high`.

2. **Analyze the current state**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.
   - `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`.
   - `st` is an empty set.

3. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `low + 1 < high`.

4. **Check the current values**:
   - `low` is 0.
   - `high` is `n - 1`.

5. **Evaluate the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute, `low + 1` must be less than `high`.
   - Substituting the current values: `0 + 1 < n - 1` simplifies to `1 < n - 1`, which further simplifies to `n > 2`.

6. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `low` and `high` are already set, no changes are needed for these variables.
   - The critical factor is ensuring that `n` (the length of the array) is greater than 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state right before the loop should be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 2.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`low` is 0; `high` is `n - 1`; `pos` is the index in the array `arr` where the value `k` is found, or `-1` if `k` is not present in `arr`; `st` is an empty set; `n` must be greater than 2**
