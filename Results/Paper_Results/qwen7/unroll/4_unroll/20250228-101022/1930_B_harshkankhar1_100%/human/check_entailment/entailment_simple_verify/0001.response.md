### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identifies the core logic of the program and its validity. Let's break down the key points and verify them:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the integer `n`, which represents the length of the permutation.

2. **Permutation Generation**:
   - Inside the loop for each test case, the function `func_1()` is called.
   - `func_1()` generates a list `a` containing integers from `1` to `n`.
   - It then reverses every other element in the list. Specifically, `a[::2]` selects every second element starting from index `0`, and `[::-1]` reverses these selected elements.

3. **Output**:
   - The reversed list `a` is printed using `print(*a)`.

### Verification Against Problem Description

- **Permutation Validity**:
  - The generated list `a` is indeed a permutation of integers from `1` to `n` because it contains each integer exactly once.
  - The reversal of every other element ensures that no two distinct indices \(i\) and \(j\) (where \(1 \leq i, j < n\) and \(i \neq j\)) exist such that \(p_i\) divides \(p_j\) and \(p_{i+1}\) divides \(p_{j+1}\). This is because the division condition would only hold if both pairs \((p_i, p_{i+1})\) and \((p_j, p_{j+1})\) were in the same relative order, which is not possible due to the alternating reversal.

### Examples

- For \(n = 4\):
  - Original list: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - Reversed every other element: `[4, 2, 3, 1]`
  - This permutation is valid because no pair \((p_i, p_{i+1})\) divides another pair \((p_j, p_{j+1})\).

- For \(n = 3\):
  - Original list: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Reversed every other element: `[3, 2, 1]`
  - This permutation is valid for the same reason.
