You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n and three strings a, b, c , each consisting of n
lowercase Latin letters.

Let a template be a string t consisting of n lowercase and/or uppercase Latin
letters. The string s matches the template t if the following conditions hold
for all i from 1 to n :

  * if the i -th letter of the template is lowercase, then s_i must be the same as t_i ; 
  * if the i -th letter of the template is uppercase, then s_i must be different from the lowercase version of t_i . For example, if there is a letter 'A' in the template, you cannot use the letter 'a' in the corresponding position of the string. 

Accordingly, the string doesn't match the template if the condition doesn't
hold for at least one i .

Determine whether there exists a template t such that the strings a and b
match it, while the string c does not.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 \le n \le 20 ) — the
length of the given strings.

The next three lines contain the strings a, b and c . Each string consists of
exactly n lowercase Latin letters.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if there exists a template t such that the
strings a and b match it, while the string c does not. Otherwise, print "NO".

    1
    
    a
    
    b
    
    c
    
    2
    
    aa
    
    bb
    
    aa

    luckforces
    
    adhoccoder
    
    3
    
    acc
    
    abd
    
    abc

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first test case, you can use the template "C". The first letter of
strings a and b differ from 'c', so they match the template. The first letter
of string c equals 'c', so it doesn't match.

In the third test case, you can use the template "CODEforces".

- Program: 
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        c = input()
        no = True
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        if no:
            print('NO')



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 20, and a, b, c are strings consisting of exactly n lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    tests = int(input())
    for i in range(tests):
        slength = int(input())
        
        a = input()
        
        b = input()
        
        c = input()
        
        no = True
        
        if c == a or c == b:
            no = False
            print('NO')
        else:
            for x in c:
                if x not in a and x not in b:
                    print('YES')
                    no = False
                    break
        
        if no:
            print('NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration based on the conditions specified in the loop. For each test case, if character `c` is found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if every character in `c` is present in either `a` or `b`. If any character in `c` is not found in both `a` and `b`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. This process repeats for each of the `tests` inputs.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, each consisting of exactly `n` lowercase Latin letters, where `n` is between 1 and 20. It then checks if the string `c` contains any character that is not present in either `a` or `b`. If `c` contains such a character, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, if `c` is entirely composed of characters found in either `a` or `b`, it prints 'NO'. This process is repeated for each of the `t` test cases provided, where `t` is between 1 and 1000. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, and if not, it prints "YES". However, this approach is insufficient because it does not account for the template matching rules described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- According to the problem description, we need to check if there exists a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
- In this case, a valid template could be "AB", where the first character must be 'a' (or 'A') and the second character must be 'b' (or 'B').
- Both `a` ("aa") and `b` ("bb") do not match this template, but `c` ("ab") does match it.
- Therefore, the output should be "NO", but the provided program will incorrectly output "YES".

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the template matching logic, hence the correctness is **False**.
