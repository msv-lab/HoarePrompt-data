Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `c` is exactly equal to `a` or `b`, and if not, it prints "YES". However, this approach is insufficient because it does not account for the template matching rules described in the problem statement.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
2
aa
bb
ab
```

- According to the problem description, we need to check if there exists a template `t` such that both `a` and `b` match it, but `c` does not.
- In this case, a valid template could be "AB", where the first character must be 'a' (or 'A') and the second character must be 'b' (or 'B').
- Both `a` ("aa") and `b` ("bb") do not match this template, but `c` ("ab") does match it.
- Therefore, the output should be "NO", but the provided program will incorrectly output "YES".

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly handle the template matching logic, hence the correctness is **False**.
