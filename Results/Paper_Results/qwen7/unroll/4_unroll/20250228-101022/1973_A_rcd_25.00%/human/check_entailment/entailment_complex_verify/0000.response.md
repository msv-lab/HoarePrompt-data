### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given program and the annotated code to determine its correctness.

#### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. The scores \(p_1, p_2, p_3\) must satisfy \(0 \leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30\).
2. The total score \(p_1 + p_2 + p_3\) must be even.
3. The scores must be achievable through a combination of wins and draws.

#### Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases \(t\) and then processes each test case.
2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of \(p_1, p_2, p_3\) is even. If not, it prints \(-1\) and continues to the next test case.
3. **Score Inconsistency Check**: The program checks if \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\). If true, it prints \(p_1 + p_2\), which is incorrect as per the problem statement.
4. **Finding Maximum Draws**: The program attempts to find the maximum number of draws by iterating over possible values of \(cur\).

#### Issues Identified:
1. **Incorrect Handling of Inconsistent Scores**: The program incorrectly prints \(p_1 + p_2\) when \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\). This violates the problem constraints.
2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The logic for finding the maximum number of draws is flawed. It does not correctly account for all possible combinations of wins and draws.

#### Example Analysis:
- **Input: `1 1 10`**
  - \(p_1 = 1\), \(p_2 = 1\), \(p_3 = 10\)
  - Sum \(= 12\) (even)
  - \(p_3 \geq p_1 + p_2\) is false, so the program should proceed to find the maximum number of draws.
  - The program incorrectly prints `2`, which is not the correct maximum number of draws. The correct output should be \(-1\).

#### Correct Approach:
- **Check Consistency**: Ensure the scores are consistent with the rules.
- **Calculate Maximum Draws**: Use a more systematic approach to find the maximum number of draws.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the analysis, the provided program does not correctly handle all cases and produces incorrect results for certain inputs. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**
