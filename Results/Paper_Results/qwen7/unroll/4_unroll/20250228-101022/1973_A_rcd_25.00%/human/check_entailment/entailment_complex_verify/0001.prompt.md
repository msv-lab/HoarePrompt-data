You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

                else:
                    cur += 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers or -1, depending on the input provided to the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even and \(p3\) is less than \(p1 + p2\), the output will be \(p1 + p2\). Otherwise, it will find a value of \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and print \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) is found, it will print \(p3\). Each output corresponds to the respective input triplet \((p1, p2, p3)\) provided in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of input triplets \((p1, p2, p3)\) and a positive integer \(t\). For each triplet, it checks if the sum of \(p1\), \(p2\), and \(p3\) is even. If the sum is odd or \(p3\) is greater than or equal to \(p1 + p2\), it outputs \(-1\). Otherwise, it finds a value \(cur\) such that \(p1 - cur \leq p2 - (p3 - cur)\) and prints \(p1 - cur + p3\). If no such \(cur\) exists, it prints \(p3\). The function does not return any value but prints the results for each triplet.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Checking Total Points:**
   - The program checks if the sum of the points `(p1 + p2 + p3)` is even.
   - If the sum is odd, it prints `-1` because an odd total cannot be achieved through the given scoring rules (each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points in total from a draw).
   - This check is correct.

3. **Initial Condition Check:**
   - The program checks if `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
     - If true, it prints `p1 + p2`. 
     - This condition implies that the highest score (`p3`) is at least as high as the combined scores of the other two players. 
     - If this condition is met, the only way to achieve these scores is if the other two players had no wins and the highest scorer won all their games, which means no draws.
     - This logic is correct for the case where no draws are involved.

4. **Binary Search for Draws:**
   - If the above condition is not met, the program performs a binary search to find the maximum number of draws.
   - It sets `low` and `high` based on the difference between `p3` and `p1` and `p2`.
   - It iteratively checks if the current value of `cur` (which represents the number of draws) can satisfy the condition that `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)`.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it prints `p1 - cur + p3` and breaks the loop.
   - If the condition is not satisfied, it increments `cur` and continues the search.
   - This approach aims to find the maximum number of draws that fit the given scores.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle some edge cases properly, such as when the scores are inconsistent but do not meet the initial condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`.
   - For example, in the case `1 1 10`, the program incorrectly prints `2` instead of `-1`.

### Conclusion:

The program has logical flaws in handling certain edge cases, particularly when the scores are inconsistent but do not meet the initial condition `p3 >= p1 + p2`. Therefore, the program is not fully correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
