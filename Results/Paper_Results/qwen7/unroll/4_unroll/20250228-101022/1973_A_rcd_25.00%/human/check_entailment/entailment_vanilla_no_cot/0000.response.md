Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:

The provided solution has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem:

1. **Initial Check for Validity**: The initial check `(p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0` is not sufficient to determine if the scores are consistent. This check only verifies if the total points are even, but it does not ensure that the scores can be achieved through valid games.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current implementation does not properly account for the constraints and relationships between the scores of the three players.

3. **Break Condition**: The `break` statement inside the `while` loop is used incorrectly. It should be used to exit the loop when a valid configuration is found, but the condition `p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur)` is not correctly formulated to find the maximum number of draws.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Check if total points are even
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the total points that must be distributed
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        
        # Check if the distribution of points is possible
        if p3 > (total_points // 2):
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = 0
        for i in range(total_points // 2 + 1):
            if (p1 - i) * 2 + (p2 - (total_points // 2 - i)) * 2 + i == total_points:
                max_draws = i
                break
        
        print(max_draws)

func()
```

This corrected solution ensures that the scores are consistent and calculates the maximum number of draws correctly by iterating through possible values and checking if they satisfy the conditions.
