State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 500, and t must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `t` as the range parameter.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a valid value that can be used as the upper limit for the range function.
3. The range function requires an integer greater than 0.
4. Given that `t` is an input integer between 1 and 500, we need to ensure that `t` is indeed an integer and is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state must be adjusted to reflect that `t` must be an integer between 1 and 500 and must be greater than 0.
