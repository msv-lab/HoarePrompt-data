Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 500.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\), the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. The other variables `p_1`, `p_2`, and `p_3` remain unaffected by this code.
