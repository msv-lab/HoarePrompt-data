Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
   - It checks if the sum of the scores is even. If not, it prints `-1` and continues to the next test case.
     ```python
     if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
         print(-1)
         continue
     ```

2. **Checking Basic Validity:**
   - It checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If so, it prints `p1 + p2`, which seems incorrect because this condition does not necessarily imply the maximum number of draws.
     ```python
     if p3 >= p1 + p2:
         print(p1 + p2)
     ```

3. **Finding Maximum Number of Draws:**
   - It calculates the lower and upper bounds for the number of draws.
     ```python
     (low, high) = (min(p3 - p1, p3 - p2), max(p3 - p1, p3 - p2))
     ```
   - It initializes `cur` to `low` and iterates while `high` is greater than or equal to `cur`.
     ```python
     cur = low
     while high >= cur:
         if p1 - cur <= p2 - (p3 - cur):
             print(p1 - cur + p3)
             break
         else:
             cur += 1
     else:
         print(p3)
     ```

### Issues Identified:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Maximum Draws:**
   - The logic for determining the maximum number of draws is flawed. The current implementation does not correctly account for the constraints and possible scenarios involving draws.

2. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle all edge cases properly, such as when the scores are inconsistent with any valid set of games and results.

### Correct Solution Approach:

To find the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- Each game can result in either 2 points for one player (no draw) or 2 points total (1 point each for the two players).
- We need to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        total_points = p1 + p2 + p3
        if total_points % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        # Calculate the maximum possible number of draws
        max_draws = (total_points - 2 * (p3 - p1)) // 2
        if max_draws < 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(max_draws)

func()
```

### Conclusion:

The original program has logical flaws and does not correctly determine the maximum number of draws. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
