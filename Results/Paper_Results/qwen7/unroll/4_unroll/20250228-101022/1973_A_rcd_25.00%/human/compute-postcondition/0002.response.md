Output State: t is an input integer between 1 and 500, and for each iteration of the loop, either -1, p1 + p2, or p1 - cur + p3 is printed based on the conditions given, where p1, p2, and p3 are integers read from input that satisfy (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 == 0 and p3 < p1 + p2. If no valid output is found within the loop, p3 is printed.
