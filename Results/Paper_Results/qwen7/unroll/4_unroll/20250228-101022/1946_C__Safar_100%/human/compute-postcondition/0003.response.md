Output State: `g` is a list of lists where each index represents a vertex in the tree, and the value at each index is a list of its adjacent vertices. After executing the loop, `g` will contain the adjacency list representation of a tree with `n` vertices, where each edge `(a, b)` has been added bidirectionally to both `g[a]` and `g[b]`.
