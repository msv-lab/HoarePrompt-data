Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here's why:

1. **Logic Flaw**: The code attempts to find a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`i` and `p[i-1]` where `q == i + 1`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2`. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks for a direct pair without considering indirect pairs or cycles.

2. **Handling Cycles**: The problem involves cycles in the best friend relationships. For example, in the input `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`, there is a cycle `3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 3`. The current implementation does not handle such cycles correctly.

3. **Minimum Invitations**: The solution should aim to minimize the number of invitations sent. The current approach may miss optimal solutions, especially in cases with cycles.

To fix this, we need to consider all possible cycles and ensure that we cover at least 2 friends efficiently. A more robust approach would involve identifying all cycles and ensuring that at least 2 friends from any cycle are invited.

Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    def dfs(i, visited, path):
        if visited[i]:
            return path[path.index(i):]
        visited[i] = True
        path.append(i)
        return dfs(l[i-1], visited, path)

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().split()))
        visited = [False] * (n + 1)
        min_invitations = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if not visited[i]:
                path = dfs(i, visited, [])
                if len(path) >= 2:
                    min_invitations = min(min_invitations, len(path))
        
        print(min_invitations if min_invitations != float('inf') else 2)

func()
```

This revised solution uses depth-first search (DFS) to identify cycles and ensures that at least 2 friends from each cycle are invited, minimizing the total number of invitations.
