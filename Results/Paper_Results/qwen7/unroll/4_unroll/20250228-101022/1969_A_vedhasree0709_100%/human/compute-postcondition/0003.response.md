Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies inputs through its constraints: an integer t such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, for each test case, an integer n such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and a list p of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given conditions.**

This means the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases defined by the variables t, n, and p, and for each test case, it performs some operation based on the provided constraints and returns a result.
