Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes inputs through variables t, n, and k, where t is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and n and k are integers within specified ranges. It returns a value based on the conditions provided for n and k.**

This means the function indirectly accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `k`, with specific constraints on their values. The function then processes these parameters to determine the output, which could be a specific value or a condition based on the given ranges for `n` and `k`.
