Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `k` is greater than `4n - 2`. According to the problem description, the maximum number of diagonals in an `n x n` grid is `4n - 2`. However, the program attempts to calculate the minimum number of cells to color using `k // 2 + 1` when `k > 2 * n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

For example, consider the following input:
```
1
4 15
```
Here, `n = 4` and `k = 15`. The maximum number of diagonals is `4 * 4 - 2 = 14`. The program will incorrectly calculate the result as `15 // 2 + 1 = 8`, but the correct answer should be `4` because we can color the cells along the main diagonal and one other diagonal to satisfy the condition.

To fix this, the program should check if `k` exceeds `4n - 2` and handle it appropriately.
