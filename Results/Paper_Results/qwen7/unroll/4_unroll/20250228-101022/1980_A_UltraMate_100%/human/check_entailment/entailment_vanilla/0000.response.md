Let's break down the solution step-by-step to verify its correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`. For each test case, it reads `n` (number of problems in the bank) and `m` (number of upcoming rounds), and then reads the string `s` representing the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of problems Vlad needs to create. It also defines a string `p` containing all possible difficulty levels ('ABCDEFG').

3. **Counting Existing Problems**: Using `Counter`, it counts how many problems of each difficulty level exist in the input string `s`.

4. **Calculating Missing Problems**:
   - For each difficulty level in `p`, if the level does not exist in `hmp` (the counter dictionary), it means Vlad needs to create `m` problems of that difficulty.
   - If the count of a particular difficulty level in `hmp` is less than `m`, it calculates the shortfall (`m - hmp[i]`) and adds this to `ans`.

5. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `ans` for each test case.

### Reasoning:
- The logic correctly identifies the missing problems needed for each difficulty level.
- The use of `Counter` ensures that the counting of existing problems is efficient.
- The calculation of the shortfall for each difficulty level is accurate.

Given the provided example and the general logic of the program, it appears to handle all edge cases correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the minimum number of additional problems Vlad needs to create.

**Correctness: True**
