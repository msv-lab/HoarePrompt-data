The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( m \), and a string \( s \) consisting of \( n \) characters from 'A' to 'G'. It calculates the number of additional occurrences of each character required to make the count of each character in \( s \) equal to \( m \). Finally, it prints the total count of these additional occurrences for each test case.
