You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vlad is planning to hold m rounds next month. Each round should contain one
problem of difficulty levels 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', and 'G'.

Vlad already has a bank of n problems, where the i -th problem has a
difficulty level of a_i . There may not be enough of these problems, so he may
have to come up with a few more problems.

Vlad wants to come up with as few problems as possible, so he asks you to find
the minimum number of problems he needs to come up with in order to hold m
rounds.

For example, if m=1 , n = 10 , a= 'BGECDCBDED', then he needs to come up with
two problems: one of difficulty level 'A' and one of difficulty level 'F'.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 50
, 1 \le m \le 5 ) — the number of problems in the bank and the number of
upcoming rounds, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a string a of n characters from 'A'
to 'G' — the difficulties of the problems in the bank.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of problems
that need to come up with to hold m rounds.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ m ≤ 5, and a is a string of n characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        ans = 0
        
        p = 'ABCDEFG'

        for i in hmp:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000. For each iteration of the loop, n and m are integers, s is a string consisting of characters from 'A' to 'G', hmp is a counter object containing the count of each character in s, and ans is an integer calculated based on the counts of characters in s and the value of m. After all iterations, ans is the sum of additional occurrences of each character required to make the count of each character in s equal to m.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the required number of problems for a specific difficulty level is less than the number available in the bank. Specifically, the program incorrectly increments `ans` by `m - hmp[i]` for each difficulty level that is missing, which will always result in an overestimation of the number of problems needed.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
9 1
BBCDEFFGG
```

The program will output `1`, but the correct answer should be `0` because there are already enough problems ('B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G') to cover the required rounds without needing to create any new problems.

The correct approach would be to check if the count of each difficulty level in the bank is sufficient for the required rounds. If not, only then increment `ans` by the difference. Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        s = input()
        ans = 0
        p = 'ABCDEFG'
        hmp = Counter(s)
        
        for i in p:
            if hmp[i] < m:
                ans += m - hmp[i]
        
        print(ans)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the program only increments `ans` when the count of a difficulty level in the bank is less than the required number of rounds, thus providing the correct minimum number of problems needed.
