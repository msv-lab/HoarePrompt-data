State: **`t` must be an integer between 1 and 1000, `_` is irrelevant as it is a throwaway variable**.

Explanation:
- The variable `t` is initialized by taking an input from the user, which is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- The loop `for _ in range(t):` will execute `t` times.
- Since `t` determines how many times the loop will run, it must be a valid integer within the specified range for the loop to execute.
- The variable `_` is a throwaway variable used as the loop counter and does not need to be adjusted; its value is irrelevant for the loop's execution condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
