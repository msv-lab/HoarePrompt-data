You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a binary string^{\dagger} . Please find the minimum number of
pieces you need to cut it into, so that the resulting pieces can be rearranged
into a sorted binary string.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/76039f9769ba94c1817dbbc5e1fb1b5e4f60950f.png)

Note that:

  * each character must lie in exactly one of the pieces; 
  * the pieces must be contiguous substrings of the original string; 
  * you must use all the pieces in the rearrangement. 

^{\dagger} A binary string is a string consisting of characters \texttt{0} and
\texttt{1} . A sorted binary string is a binary string such that all
characters \texttt{0} come before all characters \texttt{1} .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single string s (1 \leq |s| \leq
500 ) consisting of characters \texttt{0} and \texttt{1} , where |s| denotes
the length of the string s .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of pieces
needed to be able to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Example

Input

    6
    
    11010
    
    00000000
    
    1
    
    10
    
    0001111
    
    0110

Output

    3
    1
    1
    2
    1
    2
    
Note

The first test case is pictured in the statement. It can be proven that you
can't use fewer than 3 pieces.

In the second and third test cases, the binary string is already sorted, so
only 1 piece is needed.

In the fourth test case, you need to make a single cut between the two
characters and rearrange them to make the string \texttt{01} .

- Program: 
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count = 0
        flag = 0
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)



- Annotated Code: 
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        
        count = 0
        
        flag = 0
        
        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if int(s[i]) != int(s[i + 1]):
                count += 1
            if int(s[i]) < int(s[i + 1]):
                flag = 1
        
        if flag == 0:
            print(count + 1)
        else:
            print(count)
        
    #State: Output State: t is a positive integer between 1 and 500, s is a binary string with a length between 1 and 500, and after executing the loop, for each input string s, if no two consecutive characters are different (i.e., s is either "000...0" or "111...1"), the output is the length of s plus one; otherwise, the output is the number of positions where consecutive characters differ.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer t and a binary string s. It counts the number of positions where consecutive characters in s differ. If no two consecutive characters are different, it adds one to this count. The function then prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the cases where the binary string has multiple segments of consecutive zeros or ones. Specifically, the program counts the number of transitions between different digits and adds one to this count to determine the number of pieces needed. However, this approach fails when the string consists of multiple segments of the same digit.

For example, consider the input string "010101". According to the problem description, the minimum number of pieces needed is 2, because we can split the string into "01" and "010", and then rearrange these pieces to form a sorted binary string. However, the program would incorrectly count the transitions and output 3, which is not the minimum number of pieces required.

To fix this, the program needs to identify and count the segments of consecutive zeros and ones separately. Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        s = input()
        count_zeros = 0
        count_ones = 0
        current_char = s[0]
        
        for char in s:
            if char != current_char:
                if current_char == '0':
                    count_zeros += 1
                else:
                    count_ones += 1
                current_char = char
        
        # Add one more piece for the last segment
        count_zeros += 1
        count_ones += 1
        
        # The minimum number of pieces needed is the maximum of count_zeros and count_ones
        print(max(count_zeros, count_ones))

func()
```

This corrected version correctly identifies the segments of consecutive zeros and ones and calculates the minimum number of pieces needed based on these segments.
