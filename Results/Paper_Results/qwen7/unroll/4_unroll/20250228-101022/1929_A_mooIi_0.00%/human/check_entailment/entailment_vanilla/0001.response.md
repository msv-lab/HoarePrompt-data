Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Problem Analysis
The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array \( a \), which is defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements:
\[ \text{Beauty} = \sum_{i=2}^{n} (a_i - a_{i-1}) \]

To maximize this, we should arrange the array such that the largest values are placed at the beginning and the smallest values are placed at the end, because the differences will be maximized when the largest values come first.

### Given Program Analysis
The provided program does the following:
1. It reads the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array \( n \).
3. It reads the array elements.
4. It sorts the array and converts it to a string representation.
5. It prints the sorted array as a space-separated string.

### Issues with the Program
1. **Sorting and Rearranging**: The program sorts the array but does not rearrange the elements to maximize the beauty. Instead, it simply prints the sorted array, which does not achieve the desired result.
2. **Output Format**: The program outputs the sorted array as a space-separated string, which is not required by the problem statement. The problem asks for the maximum beauty value, not the sorted array itself.
3. **Calculation of Beauty**: The program does not calculate the beauty of the array after sorting, so it cannot provide the correct answer.

### Correct Solution
To solve the problem correctly, we need to:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the size of the array and its elements.
3. Sort the array.
4. Calculate the beauty of the array by computing the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
5. Output the maximum beauty for each test case.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        ar = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ar.sort()
        beauty = sum(ar[i] - ar[i-1] for i in range(1, n))
        print(beauty)

func()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because it does not calculate the maximum beauty of the array. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
