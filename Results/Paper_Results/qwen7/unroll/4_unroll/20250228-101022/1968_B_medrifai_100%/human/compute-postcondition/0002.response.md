Output State: **The program returns the value of j plus index, where index is the position where a[i] is found in the substring of b starting from j, and both a and b are binary strings.**

This means that the program returns the sum of the current index `j` in string `b` and the position `index` where the character `a[i]` is found within the substring of `b` starting from `j`.
