Reasoning:

1. The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`.
2. The outer loop iterates through each test case.
3. For each test case, the inner loop uses the `func_1` function to check if the current character of `a` (starting from index `i`) is present in the remaining part of `b` (starting from index `j`).
4. If the character is found, the indices are updated, and the count `c` is incremented.
5. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the character `a[i]` in the substring `b[j:]` and returns the appropriate position.
6. The program stops when either the end of `a` or `b` is reached, ensuring that the maximum possible prefix is found.

Given the execution summary and the provided code, the program appears to be logically sound and should produce the correct results according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
