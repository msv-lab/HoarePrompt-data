Reasoning:

1. The main loop iterates through each test case, correctly reading the lengths of strings `a` and `b`, and the strings themselves.
2. The variables `i` and `j` are initialized to 0, representing the current indices in strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
3. The variable `c` is used to count the number of matching characters, which forms the prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
4. The function `func_1` is called with the appropriate parameters to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in the remaining part of `b` starting from index `j`.
5. If `func_1` finds a match, it updates `j` to the position after the found character and increments `i` and `c`.
6. If no match is found, the loop breaks, and the result `c` is printed.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the next occurrence of `a[i]` in `b` starting from index `j`. It uses the `find` method to locate the character and returns the correct index if found, or `-1` if not found.

Given that the logic in the main loop and the function `func_1` aligns with the problem statement and the expected behavior, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
