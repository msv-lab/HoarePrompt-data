The function `func_1` accepts two binary strings `a` and `b`, and two integers `i` and `j`. It searches for the character `a[i]` in the substring of `b` starting from index `j`. If the character is found, it returns the value of `j` plus the index within the substring where `a[i]` is located; otherwise, it returns `-1`.
