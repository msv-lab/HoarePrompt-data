Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: a (a binary string), b (a binary string), i (an integer indicating the current index in string a), and j (an integer indicating the current index in string b). It returns the value of j plus the index where a[i] is found in the substring of b starting from j, if a[i] is found in b[j:]; otherwise, it returns -1.**
