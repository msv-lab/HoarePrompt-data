### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading `n`, `a`, and `b` for each case.

2. **Condition Analysis**:
   - If `b <= a`, the program prints `n * a`. This means that selling all buns at the usual price `a` is the best option since the modified price `b` is not beneficial.
   - If `b - a >= n`, the program calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is `b` and the last term is `b - (n-1)`.
   - Otherwise, the program uses the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` to calculate the profit. This formula is derived from the sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence with the first term `(b - (k-1))` and the last term `b`.

3. **Formula Verification**:
   - For `b - a >= n`, the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)` is correct because it represents the sum of an arithmetic series starting from `b` down to `b - (n-1)`.
   - For `b - a < n`, the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is also correct because it accounts for the sum of the first `k` terms of the arithmetic sequence plus the usual price for the remaining buns.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles edge cases such as when `b <= a` and when `b - a >= n` correctly.
   - The program also handles the general case where `b - a < n` correctly.

However, there is a potential issue with the formula used in the general case (`b - a < n`). Let's verify the formula:

- The sum of the first `k` terms of an arithmetic sequence with the first term `b - (k-1)` and the last term `b` is given by:
  \[
  S = \frac{k}{2} \left(2b - (k-1)\right)
  \]
  Simplifying, we get:
  \[
  S = \frac{k}{2} \left(2b - k + 1\right)
  \]
  Since `k = b - a`, substituting `k` gives:
  \[
  S = \frac{b - a}{2} \left(2b - (b - a) + 1\right) = \frac{b - a}{2} \left(b + a + 1\right)
  \]
  Therefore, the correct formula should be:
  \[
  \text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b + a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n
  \]

The current formula in the program is:
\[
\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n
\]

This formula does not account for the correct sum of the arithmetic sequence. The correct formula should use `b + a + 1` instead of `b - a + 1`.

### Conclusion:
The program has a logical error in the formula used for the general case (`b - a < n`). The correct formula should be:
\[
\text{Profit} = \frac{(b - a) \cdot (b + a + 1)}{2} + a \cdot n
\]

Given this error, the program is not correct.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
