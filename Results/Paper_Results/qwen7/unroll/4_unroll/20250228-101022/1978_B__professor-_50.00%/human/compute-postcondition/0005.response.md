Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of three positive integers \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\) (where \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\)). For each test case, it calculates and prints one of three possible results based on the values of \(n\), \(a\), and \(b\):

1. If \(b \leq a\), it prints \(n \times a\).
2. If \(b - a \geq n\), it prints \(\frac{(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).
3. Otherwise, it prints \(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n\).

After processing all test cases, the function outputs a series of integers corresponding to the calculated results for each test case.**
