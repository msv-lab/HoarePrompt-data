State: **`t` must be greater than 0**

Explanation:
- The loop head contains the variable `_` (which is typically used as a throwaway variable) and `t`.
- The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.
- Since `t` represents the number of test cases, it must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.
- The variable `_` is just an index that increments with each iteration and does not affect the loop's condition, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
