Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The logic inside the loop checks the conditions as specified in the problem statement:
   - If `b <= a`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`.
   - If `b - a >= n`, it calculates the profit using the formula \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
   - Otherwise, it uses the formula \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).

4. The formulas used in the program match the problem description:
   - When \( b \leq a \), selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) gives the maximum profit.
   - When \( b - a \geq n \), selling the first \( n \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price \( a \) gives the maximum profit.
   - Otherwise, selling the first \( b - a + 1 \) buns at the modified prices and the rest at the usual price \( a \) gives the maximum profit.

Given that the logic and formulas in the program align with the problem description, the program should produce the correct results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
