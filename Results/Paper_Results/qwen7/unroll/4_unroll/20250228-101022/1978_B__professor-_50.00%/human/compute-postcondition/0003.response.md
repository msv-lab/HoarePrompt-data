Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each test case specified by the initial integer `t`, the output will depend on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` for that particular test case. If `b <= a`, it will print `n * a`. If `b - a >= n`, it will print the value of \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). Otherwise, it will print the value of \(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n\).
