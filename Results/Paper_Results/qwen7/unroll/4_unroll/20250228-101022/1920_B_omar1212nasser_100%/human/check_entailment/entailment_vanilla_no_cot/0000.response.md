Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Sorting the Array**: In `func_1`, the array `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. This helps in determining which elements to remove and how to handle the negations optimally.
3. **Optimal Strategy Calculation**:
   - `func_2` calculates the maximum possible sum after Alice and Bob make their moves.
   - It considers different scenarios where Alice removes up to `removals` elements and Bob multiplies up to `negatives` elements by -1.
   - For each scenario, it computes the potential sum of the array and keeps track of the maximum sum.
4. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Initially, the total sum `s` of the array is calculated.
   - The function then iteratively updates the sum by removing the largest elements and adjusting the sum based on the negations.
   - The key insight is to consider the impact of removing elements and negating elements to maximize the final sum.

Given the logic and the implementation, the program correctly handles the constraints and provides the expected results for the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
