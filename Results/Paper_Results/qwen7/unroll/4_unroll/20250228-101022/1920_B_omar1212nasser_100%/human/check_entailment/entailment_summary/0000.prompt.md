Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alice and Bob are playing a game. They have an array a_1, a_2,\ldots,a_n . The
game consists of two steps:

  * First, Alice will remove at most k elements from the array. 
  * Second, Bob will multiply at most x elements of the array by -1 . 

Alice wants to maximize the sum of elements of the array while Bob wants to
minimize it. Find the sum of elements of the array after the game if both
players play optimally.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , k , and x (1 \leq
n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \leq x,k \leq n ) — the number of elements in the
array, the limit on the number of elements of the array that Alice can remove,
and the limit on the number of elements of the array that Bob can multiply -1
to.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2,\ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 1000 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of elements of the array
after the game if both players play optimally.

    1 3

Output

    0
    2
    0
    3
    -5
    -9
    0
    -1
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove the only element of
the array. Then, the sum of elements of the array is 0 after the game is over.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Alice to not remove any elements.
Bob will then multiply 4 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
3+1+2-4=2 .

In the fifth test case, it is optimal for Alice to remove 9, 9 . Bob will then
multiply 5, 5, 3 by -1 . So the final sum of elements of the array is
-5-5-3+3+3+2=-5 .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
func_1()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        (n, k, x) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        product = func_2(k, x, a)
        print(product)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads three positive integers `n`, `k`, and `x`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and then calls the `func_2(k, x, a)` function to calculate a product based on the sorted list. Finally, it prints the result of `func_2(k, x, a)` for each test case.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(removals, negatives, elements):
    pos = []
    s = sum(elements)
    pos.append(s - 2 * sum(elements[-negatives:]))
    s2 = sum(elements[-negatives:])
    for i in range(1, removals + 1):
        s -= elements[-i]
        s2 -= elements[-i]
        if negatives + i <= len(elements):
            s2 += elements[-(negatives + i)]
        pos.append(s - 2 * s2)
    return max(pos)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts three parameters: `removals` (an integer), `negatives` (an integer), and `elements` (a list of integers). It calculates a list `pos` where each element is the result of `s - 2 * s2` after removing a certain number of elements from the end of `elements`. Here, `s` is the sum of the updated `elements` list, and `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the updated `elements` list. After processing, it returns the maximum value from the list `pos`. The variables `removals` and `negatives` remain unchanged, while `elements` has its last `removals` elements removed.
