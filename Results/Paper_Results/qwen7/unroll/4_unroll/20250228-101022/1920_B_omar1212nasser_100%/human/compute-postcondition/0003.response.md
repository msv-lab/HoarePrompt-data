Output State: **`pos` is a list containing the value `s - 2 * s2`, `removals` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Alice can remove, `negatives` is an integer representing the maximum number of elements Bob can multiply by -1, `elements` is a list of integers representing the array, `s` is the sum of all integers in the list `elements`, `s2` is the sum of the last `negatives` elements in `elements`.**

Explanation: The code calculates `s2` as the sum of the last `negatives` elements in the list `elements`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
