Reasoning:
1. The provided function `func()` does not correctly identify whether the grid represents a triangle or a square.
2. The function only checks if the count of '1's in the first two rows is equal, which is insufficient to determine the shape.
3. For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same, but the function does not check this condition for all rows.
4. For a triangle, the pattern of '1's should follow the specified triangular pattern, but the function does not verify this pattern.
5. The function does not handle the specific patterns required for a triangle or a square, and it fails to return the correct shape name ("SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE").

Given these points, the function is not correctly identifying the shapes in the grid.

Correctness: **False**
