You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Vladislav has a binary square grid of n \times n cells. A triangle or a square
is drawn on the grid with symbols \texttt{1} . As he is too busy being cool,
he asks you to tell him which shape is drawn on the grid.

  * A triangle is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has 2 \cdot i-1 consecutive characters \texttt{1} , and the central 1s are located in one column. An upside down triangle is also considered a valid triangle (but not rotated by 90 degrees).

Two left pictures contain examples of triangles: k=4 , k=3 . The two right
pictures don't contain triangles.

  * A square is a shape consisting of k (k>1 ) consecutive rows, where the i -th row has k consecutive characters \texttt{1} , which are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Examples of two squares: k=2 , k=4 .

For the given grid, determine the type of shape that is drawn on it.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq 10
) — the size of the grid.

The next n lines each contain n characters \texttt{0} or \texttt{1} .

The grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all
the \texttt{1} s in the grid. It is guaranteed that the size of the triangle
or square is greater than 1 (i.e., the shape cannot consist of exactly one 1).

Output

For each test case, output "SQUARE" if all the \texttt{1} s in the grid form a
square, and "TRIANGLE" otherwise (without quotes).

        k = []
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()

- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10; the grid is represented as a list of n strings, each string contains n characters which are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    for i in range(a):
        k = []
        
        for _ in range(int(input())):
            b = input()
            if '1' in b:
                k.append(b.count('1'))
        
        if k[0] == k[1]:
            print(k)
        
    #State: Output State: The grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all '1's. After the loop executes, if the count of '1's in the first two strings (k[0] and k[1]) are equal, it prints these counts. Otherwise, it does not print anything.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to identify whether a given grid contains a square or a triangle formed by '1's.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` takes no arguments but reads input from stdin.
   - It reads the number of test cases (`a`).
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid (`n`) and then reads `n` lines of input representing the grid.
   - It counts the number of '1's in each row and stores these counts in the list `k`.
   - If the first count in `k` is equal to the second count, it prints the counts.

3. **Logic Evaluation**:
   - The logic in the function does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a square or a triangle.
   - The function only checks if the first two counts of '1's in the rows are equal, which is insufficient to determine the shape.
   - For a square, all rows should have the same number of '1's, which would be `k` (where `k` is the side length of the square).
   - For a triangle, the counts of '1's in the rows should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...`, and the central '1's should align in one column.

4. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly identify the shape, we need to check the pattern of '1's in the rows.
   - For a square, the count of '1's in each row should be the same.
   - For a triangle, the count of '1's in each row should follow the pattern `1, 3, 5, ...`.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided function does not implement the correct logic to identify the shape.
   - Therefore, the function will not produce the correct output for the given problem.

### Correctness:
**False**

The function provided does not correctly identify whether the grid forms a square or a triangle based on the given problem description.
