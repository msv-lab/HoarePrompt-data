Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly identify whether the shape on the grid is a triangle or a square. The program attempts to count the number of '1's in each row but does not properly check for the specific patterns required to determine a triangle or a square. Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Logic for Identifying Shapes**: The program only checks if the first two rows have the same number of '1's, which is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square or a triangle.
2. **No Pattern Matching**: The program does not implement any logic to verify if the '1's form a triangular or square pattern as defined in the problem statement.
3. **Incomplete Output Handling**: The program prints `k` which is a list of counts of '1's in each row, instead of printing "SQUARE" or "TRIANGLE".

To correctly solve this problem, you need to implement logic to check for both the square and triangle patterns as specified in the problem description.
