Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10. Each string contains n characters which are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or exactly one square that contains all the '1's in the grid. The function returns whether the shape formed by '1's is a triangle or a square.**
