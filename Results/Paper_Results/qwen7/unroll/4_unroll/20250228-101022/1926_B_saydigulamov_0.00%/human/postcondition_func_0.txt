The function processes a grid represented as a list of n strings, where n is an integer between 2 and 10. Each string contains n characters that are either '0' or '1', and the grid contains exactly one triangle or one square that includes all the '1's. If the count of '1's in the first two strings of the grid is equal, it prints these counts. Otherwise, it does nothing. The function does not return any value.
