State right before the while loop, the variable `T` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\).

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop condition is `T`.
2. For the loop to execute the first time, `T` must be non-zero (i.e., `T > 0`).
3. Since `T` is already described as a positive integer, it inherently satisfies `T > 0`.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary because the condition `T` being non-zero is already met by the given description.

State: **`T` is an input integer, and it is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq T \leq 10^4\)**
