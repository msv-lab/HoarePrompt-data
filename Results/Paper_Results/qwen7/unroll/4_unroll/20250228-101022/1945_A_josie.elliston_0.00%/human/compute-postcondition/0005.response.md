Postcondition: `extroverts` and `universals` are non-negative integers. If the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts` modulo 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, then the minimum number of tents required cannot be determined. Otherwise, the minimum number of tents required is returned.
