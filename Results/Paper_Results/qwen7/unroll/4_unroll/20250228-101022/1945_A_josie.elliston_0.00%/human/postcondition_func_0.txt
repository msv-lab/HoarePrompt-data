The function accepts two parameters, `extroverts` and `universals`, both non-negative integers. It returns the minimum number of tents required for the extroverts and universals to be accommodated according to their preferences, or `None` if it is impossible to accommodate them. Specifically, if the number of `extroverts` is not divisible by 3 and the sum of `extroverts` modulo 3 and `universals` is greater than or equal to 3, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals)` divided by 3.
