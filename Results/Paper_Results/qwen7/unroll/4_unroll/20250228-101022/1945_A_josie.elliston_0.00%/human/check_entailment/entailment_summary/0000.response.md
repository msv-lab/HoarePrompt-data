### Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze how the functions `func_1` and `func_2` work together to solve the problem. Let's break down the logic step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` calculates the minimum number of tents required for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `extroverts` cannot form complete groups of 3 (i.e., `extroverts % 3 != 0`), it checks if adding `universals` can make up the difference to form at least one more group of 3. If not, it returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate everyone.
   - Otherwise, it returns the ceiling value of `(extroverts + universals) / 3`.

2. **Understanding `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` uses `func_1` to find out how many tents are needed for `extroverts` and `universals`.
   - If `func_1` returns `None`, indicating it's impossible to accommodate `extroverts` and `universals`, `func_2` returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, it adds the number of `introverts` to the result of `func_1` to get the total number of tents needed.

3. **Overall Logic:**
   - The program correctly handles the constraints for `introverts`, `extroverts`, and `universals`.
   - It ensures that `introverts` get their own tents.
   - It tries to maximize the use of `universals` to form groups of 3 with `extroverts`.
   - If it's impossible to form complete groups of 3 with `extroverts` and `universals`, it correctly returns `-1`.

Given the provided examples and the logic of the functions, the program appears to handle all edge cases and requirements as specified in the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution summaries of the functions.

### Correctness:
