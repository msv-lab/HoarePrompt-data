Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Input Validation**: It checks if the sum of the scores (`p_1`, `p_2`, `p_3`) is even. This is crucial because the total score must be even for the scores to be achievable through the described scoring system (since each game contributes either 2 points to one player or 2 points distributed between two players in case of a draw).
3. **Calculating Maximum Draws**: If the sum is even, it calculates the maximum number of draws using the formula `(v[0] + v[1] + v[2] - max(0, v[2] - v[0] - v[1])) // 2`. This formula accounts for the fact that each draw contributes 2 points in total (1 point to each player) and ensures that the scores are consistent with the described scoring rules.
4. **Output**: The program prints `-1` if the sum of the scores is odd, indicating an impossible scenario. Otherwise, it prints the calculated maximum number of draws.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program appears to handle all cases correctly as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
