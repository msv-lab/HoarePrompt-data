Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop condition is `l + 1 < r`.

2. **Determine the current state before the loop**:
   - `l` is 0.
   - `r` is the length of `arr`.

3. **Analyze the loop condition**:
   - For the loop to execute the first time, the condition `l + 1 < r` must be true.
   - Given `l = 0`, the condition simplifies to `1 < r`.

4. **Adjust the state**:
   - Since `l` is fixed at 0, we need to ensure that `r` is greater than 1 for the loop to execute the first time.
   - Therefore, `r` must be greater than 1.

5. **Final state before the loop**:
   - `l` is 0 (unchanged).
   - `r` must be greater than 1.

So, the final answer is:

State: **`l` is 0, `r` must be greater than 1**
