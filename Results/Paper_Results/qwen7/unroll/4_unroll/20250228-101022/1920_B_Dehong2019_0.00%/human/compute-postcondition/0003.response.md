Output State: The final value of `ans` after executing all iterations of the loop for each test case, where `t` test cases are processed. Each test case involves calculating `ans` based on the given values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a`, and then printing the maximum value between `ans1` and `ans2`.
