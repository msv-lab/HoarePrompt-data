Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; `b` is a string obtained from the input; `k` is an integer representing the number of times the condition `b[j] == a[i]` was true for all `i` in `range(n)` and before `j` reached `m`; `j` is an integer representing the position in string `b` after the loop has executed.
