Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer obtained from the first space-separated integer input; m is an integer obtained from the second space-separated integer input.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `m`, from the standard input using `input().split()`, which splits the input into two parts based on spaces. These values are then converted to integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigned to `n` and `m` respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.
