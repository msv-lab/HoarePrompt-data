Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1()` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` of string `a` that forms a subsequence of string `b`. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the lengths `n` and `m` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively, followed by the strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization**: It initializes `k` to 0 (which will store the length of the prefix) and `j` to 0 (which will traverse string `b`).

3. **Loop Through String `a`**: For each character in string `a`:
   - It uses a `while` loop to find the next occurrence of the current character of `a` in string `b`.
   - If the character is found (`b[j] == a[i]`), it increments both `k` and `j` to move to the next character in both strings.
   - If the character is not found, it breaks out of the loop since the rest of `a` cannot be a subsequence of `b`.

4. **Output**: Finally, it prints the value of `k`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the longest prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b` by checking each character of `a` in order and ensuring they appear in `b` in the same order.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, this implementation is correct.
