Functionality: **For each test case, the function reads integers \( n \) and \( m \), and two binary strings \( a \) and \( b \). It then counts the number of positions in string \( b \) where the characters match those in string \( a \) up to the current position in \( a \), without exceeding the length of \( b \). Finally, it prints the total count of such matching positions across all test cases.**
