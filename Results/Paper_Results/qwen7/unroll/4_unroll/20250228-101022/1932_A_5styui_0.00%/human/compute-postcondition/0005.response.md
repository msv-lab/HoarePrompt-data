Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input data consisting of a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and a string of length n consisting of '.', '@', and '*', where '.' represents an empty cell, '@' represents a cell with a coin, and '*' represents a cell with thorns. The function returns a specific output for each test case based on the given conditions: if the first cell is empty ('.'), and the string does not contain consecutive '*'s.**

Note: The actual output processing logic is not described here as per the instruction to only describe the parameters and return value without detailing the operation.
