Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is 0.**

The code initializes `s` to 0, which does not affect the values of `t` or `a`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `a`, while introducing `s` with the value 0.
