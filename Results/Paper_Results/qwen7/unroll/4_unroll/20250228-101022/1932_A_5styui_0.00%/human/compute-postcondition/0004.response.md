Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `a` is an input integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `s` is 0.

Explanation: The loop processes each value of `i` from 0 to `a-1`. For each iteration, it reads an integer `d` and a string `b`. It then iterates through each character of `b`, counting occurrences of the '@' character and breaking out of the inner loop under certain conditions. After processing `b`, it prints the count of '@' characters and resets `s` to 0 for the next iteration. Since `s` is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration, the final value of `s` will always be 0 regardless of the input. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state for `s`.
