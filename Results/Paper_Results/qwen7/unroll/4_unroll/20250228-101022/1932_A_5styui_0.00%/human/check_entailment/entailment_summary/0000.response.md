Reasoning:
- The problem requires finding the maximum number of coins (`@`) that can be collected starting from the leftmost cell while avoiding cells with thorns (`*`).
- The provided code attempts to count the number of coins (`@`) in the string `b` but has several issues:
  - It does not handle the movement constraints correctly.
  - It breaks out of the loop prematurely when it encounters a `*`.
  - It does not account for the possibility of skipping cells when a `*` is encountered.
  - It does not consider the optimal path to maximize the number of coins collected.

Given these issues, the current implementation does not solve the problem as intended.

Correctness: **False**
