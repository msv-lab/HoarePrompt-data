Reasoning:
1. The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
2. The annotated program defines a function `func()` which reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `x` and `y`.
3. Inside the loop, it correctly compares `x` and `y` and prints them in the required order (maximum first, then minimum).
4. The logic in the program ensures that for any pair of integers `x` and `y`, the larger one is printed first, followed by the smaller one.
5. Given the constraints (1 ≤ t ≤ 100 and 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9), the program should work correctly for all valid inputs.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
