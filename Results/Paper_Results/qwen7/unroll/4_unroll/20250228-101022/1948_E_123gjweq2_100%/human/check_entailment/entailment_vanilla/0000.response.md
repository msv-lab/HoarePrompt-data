Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` takes `n` and `k` as inputs.
   - It calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes arrays `arr` and `cliquess` of length `n`.
   - It calls `make_array` to fill the `arr` array and assigns the same clique index to all elements in the same segment.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function fills the array `arr` and `cliquess` based on the given `left`, `right`, and `clique` indices.
   - It splits the range `[left, right]` into two parts and assigns elements in a specific pattern:
     - The first half of the range is filled with smaller elements starting from `small_element`.
     - The second half of the range is filled with larger elements starting from `big_element`.

### Key Points to Check

1. **Assignment of Elements**:
   - The assignment of elements in `make_array` ensures that the condition \( |i - j| + |a_i - a_j| \le k \) is satisfied within each segment.
   - This is because elements within the same segment are either close in value or close in index, ensuring the condition holds.

2. **Partition into Cliques**:
   - The `cliquess` array correctly assigns each element to a specific clique.
   - Since the segments are defined by the `make_array` function, the resulting graph will naturally form cliques based on these segments.

3. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the required format: the values assigned to vertices, the number of cliques, and the partition of vertices into cliques.

### Verification

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to correctly generate a valid assignment of integers to vertices and partition the graph into the minimum possible number of cliques.

### Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement.

**Correctness: True**
