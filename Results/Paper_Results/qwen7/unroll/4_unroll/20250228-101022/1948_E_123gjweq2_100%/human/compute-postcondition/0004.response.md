Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The only variable in the loop head is `i`.

2. **Determine the initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 0` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `mid`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < mid`.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the loop can start executing. This means setting `i` to 0 and ensuring that `mid` is greater than 0.

Given the initial states:
- `left` is an integer
- `right` is an integer such that `left < right`
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2`
- `not_mid` is `right - left - mid + 1`

We need to focus on adjusting `i` and `mid` to ensure the loop can start executing.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
- `i` should be set to 0.
- `mid` should be greater than 0.

### Final State:
- `left` is an integer
- `right` is an integer such that `left < right`
- `small_element` is `left + 1`
- `big_element` is `right + 1`
- `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0
- `i` is 0

### State:
**`left` is an integer, `right` is an integer such that `left < right`, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(right + 1 - (left + 1) + 1) // 2` and must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
