### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, the program code, and the function summaries.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` calculates the number of cliques as `ceil(n / k)` and initializes two arrays: `arr` and `cliquess`, both of length `n`.

2. **Loop to Assign Values**:
   - The loop runs from `0` to `cliques - 1`.
   - For each iteration `i`, it calls the `make_array` function to fill the `arr` and `cliquess` arrays.
   - The `make_array` function fills the array in a specific pattern, ensuring that elements within the same segment (determined by `left` and `right`) are assigned different values but within the range `[1, n]`.

3. **Function `make_array`**:
   - This function takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as parameters.
   - It calculates `small_element` and `big_element` based on `left` and `right`.
   - It splits the range into two parts (`mid` and `not_mid`) and fills the array accordingly.
   - Elements in the first half are filled with smaller values starting from `small_element`, and elements in the second half are filled with larger values starting from `big_element`.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that:
1. The values in `arr` are distinct and within the range `[1, n]`.
2. The conditions for forming cliques are met: for every pair of vertices `(i, j)`, `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.
3. The partition into cliques is minimal.

#### Example Verification

Let's take the example from the problem statement:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 4`:
  - `cliques = ceil(5 / 4) = 2`
  - The expected output is:
    ```
    3 1 5 2 4
    2
    1 1 2 1 2
    ```

- Let's manually check the conditions:
  - Vertices 1 and 2: `|1-2| + |3-1| = 1 + 2 = 3 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 3: `|1-3| + |3-5| = 2 + 2 = 4 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 4: `|1-4| + |3-2| = 3 + 1 = 4 <= 4` (valid)
  - Vertices 1 and 5: `|1-5| + |3-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 > 4` (invalid, but they are in different cliques)
  - And so on...

- The partition ensures that vertices within the same clique satisfy the condition, and vertices in different cliques do not.

However, upon closer inspection, the `make_array` function does not guarantee that the values assigned to the vertices will always form valid cliques under the given condition. Specifically, the way the values are assigned might not always ensure that all pairs of vertices within the same clique satisfy the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k`.

For example, consider `n = 8` and `k = 16`:
- `cliques = ceil(8 / 16) = 1`
- The expected output is:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  1
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```

This output is trivially correct, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the program is correct for all cases. We need to ensure that the values assigned to the vertices always form valid cliques.

### Conclusion

Upon further analysis, the program does not guarantee that the values assigned to the vertices will always form valid cliques under the given condition. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Correctness: False**

Final: **False**
