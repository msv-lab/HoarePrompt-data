Reasoning:

1. The program correctly handles the case where \( n = k \). It prints "YES", 1, and 1, which is correct because Alice can buy exactly \( k \) jewels by buying one jewel from one stall, spending exactly \( k \) coins.

2. The program correctly handles the case where \( n < k \). It prints "NO", which is correct because Alice cannot buy any jewels if she doesn't have enough coins.

3. For the case where \( n \geq k \), the program attempts to find a way to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed.

   - The variable `h` is supposed to count the number of stalls needed, but the calculation of `h` is incorrect. Specifically, the code calculates `h` as the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`, which does not necessarily give the correct number of stalls.
   
   - The values of `costs` are set to `[n - k + 1, 1]`, but the logic to distribute the jewels among the stalls is incorrect. The program does not ensure that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels by setting the prices of the stalls.

4. The program does not guarantee that the number of stalls will be at most 60. The logic provided does not ensure that the number of stalls is minimized or even within the limit of 60.

Given these points, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, particularly when \( n \geq k \).

Correctness: **False**
