### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires setting up stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins. Alice buys greedily from each stall in sequence until she cannot afford any more jewels in the next stall.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k`.
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is defined to handle the logic for determining if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels.

3. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - If `n == k`, it prints "YES", 1, and 1. This is correct because if Alice has exactly `k` coins and each jewel costs 1 coin, she can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - If `n < k`, it prints "NO". This is also correct because if Alice has fewer coins than needed to buy even one jewel, it's impossible.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the cost array `costs` and checks if the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from these stalls is at least `k`. If so, it prints "YES" and the number of stalls and the cost array. If not, it prints "NO".

4. **Stall Setup and Pricing**:
   - The program attempts to use only 2 stalls, which might not always be sufficient. However, the problem statement allows for up to 60 stalls, but the solution only uses 2 stalls.
   - The logic to determine if it's possible to achieve `k` jewels with 2 stalls is correct, but it doesn't explore other potential solutions involving more stalls.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the basic cases correctly but does not cover all edge cases, especially when more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, if `n` is very large and `k` is close to `n`, the program might fail to find a solution with just 2 stalls.
   - The function summary indicates that the function should consider all possible stalls, but the implementation only uses 2 stalls. This means the function is incomplete and does not fully meet the problem requirements.

6. **Function Summary**:
   - The function summary states that the function should consider all possible stalls, but the implementation only uses 2 stalls. This discrepancy suggests that the function is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

### Conclusion:

The program is partially correct but incomplete. It only considers the simplest scenario of using 2 stalls and does not explore other possibilities. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem statement.

**Correctness:** False

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
