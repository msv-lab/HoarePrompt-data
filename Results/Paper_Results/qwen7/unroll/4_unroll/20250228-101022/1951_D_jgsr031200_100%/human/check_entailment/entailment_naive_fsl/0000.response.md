Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the program attempts to determine if it's possible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels, but it fails to handle the scenario where the number of stalls needed exceeds 60.

Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Stall Setup**: The program tries to set up at most 2 stalls (`print(2)`), which is insufficient to handle all cases where more than 2 stalls are needed. For example, if `n = 255` and `k = 8`, the program should set up 8 stalls with prices `[128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`. However, the program only sets up 2 stalls and prints the prices `[128, 1]`, which is incorrect.

2. **Logic for Determining Prices**: The logic used to determine the prices for the stalls is flawed. It does not ensure that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels across the stalls. Instead, it attempts to split the coins into two parts and determine how many jewels can be bought from each part, which does not guarantee that the total number of jewels bought will be exactly `k`.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:
- Input: `255 8`
- Expected Output: 
    ```
    YES
    8
    128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1
    ```

However, the program outputs:
- Output:
    ```
    YES
    2
    128 1
    ```

This output is incorrect because Alice would only buy 2 jewels (one from the first stall and one from the second stall), not 8.

Since the program does not correctly handle the scenario where more than 2 stalls are needed and does not guarantee that Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels, the program is incorrect.
