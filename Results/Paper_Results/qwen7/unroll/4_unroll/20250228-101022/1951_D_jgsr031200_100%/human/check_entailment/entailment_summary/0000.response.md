Reasoning:

1. **Case Analysis**:
   - When `n == k`, the program correctly prints "YES", 1, and 1.
   - When `n < k`, the program correctly prints "NO".
   - When `n >= k`, the program attempts to calculate the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from two different stalls and checks if this sum is at least `k`.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program calculates `curr = n // i` for `i = n - k + 1` and `i = 1`.
   - It then sums these values to get `h`.
   - If `h < k`, it prints "NO".
   - Otherwise, it prints "YES", 2, and the values of `costs`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - For `n == k`, the logic is correct because Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels if the price is set to 1.
   - For `n < k`, the logic is correct because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.
   - For `n >= k`, the logic should ensure that the sum of the number of jewels Alice can buy from the two stalls is at least `k`.

4. **Stall Prices**:
   - The prices are set to `n - k + 1` and 1, which ensures that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels in total.
   - The logic correctly handles the condition where the sum of jewels bought from both stalls is at least `k`.

5. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the required format for "YES" and "NO" cases.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

Correctness: **True**
