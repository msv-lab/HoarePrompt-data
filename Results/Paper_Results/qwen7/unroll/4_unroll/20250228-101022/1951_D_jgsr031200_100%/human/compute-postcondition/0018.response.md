Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is greater than or equal to `k`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - Since `n` is 0, let's evaluate the expression for `h`:
     - `n // (n - k + 1)`: When `n` is 0, the denominator `n - k + 1` becomes `-k + 1`. If `k` is 1 or more, this results in a division by a negative number or zero, leading to undefined behavior or a runtime error in most programming contexts. However, since we are focusing on the logical evaluation and assuming valid input, we need to consider the integer division rules.
     - `n // 1`: This is simply `0 // 1`, which equals 0.
   - Therefore, `h` would be `0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition `h >= k` must hold true. Given `h` is 0, `k` must be 0 or less for this condition to be true. However, if `k` is greater than 0, the condition fails. But since we are only concerned with the print statement and the initial state provided, we can proceed with the given condition.

4. **Print Statement**:
   - The print statement is `print('YES')`.

Given the above analysis, the print statement will execute and print the string `'YES'`.

Output: **YES**
