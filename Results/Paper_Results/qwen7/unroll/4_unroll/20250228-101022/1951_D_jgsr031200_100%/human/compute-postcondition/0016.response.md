Let's break down the initial state and the print statement step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is 0.
   - `h` is the sum of `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - `h` is less than `k`.

2. **Evaluate `h`:**
   - Since `n` is 0, we need to evaluate `n // (n - k + 1)` and `n // 1`.
   - For `n // (n - k + 1)`, since `n` is 0, the expression becomes `0 // (0 - k + 1)`, which simplifies to `0 // (-k + 1)`. This results in `0` because any number divided by a non-zero number (in this case, `-k + 1`) is 0 if the numerator is 0.
   - For `n // 1`, since `n` is 0, the expression becomes `0 // 1`, which also results in `0`.

   Therefore, `h = 0 + 0 = 0`.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - We are given that `h` is less than `k`. Since `h` is 0, this condition is satisfied for any positive value of `k`.

4. **Print Statement:**
   - The print statement is `print('NO')`.

Given the above steps, the print statement will output the string `'NO'`.

Output: **'NO'**
