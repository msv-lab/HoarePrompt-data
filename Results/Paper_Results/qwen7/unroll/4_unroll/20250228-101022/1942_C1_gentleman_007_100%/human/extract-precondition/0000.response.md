Precondition: **num is a non-negative integer.** 

However, based on the problem description and the function provided, the function `func_11` does not seem to be relevant to the problem of maximizing the number of triangular pieces of cake. The function appears to be related to finding prime numbers up to a certain limit, which is not directly connected to the cake cutting problem described. Therefore, the precondition provided here is for the function `func_11` and not for the cake cutting problem itself.

For the cake cutting problem, the precondition should be as follows:

Precondition: **t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases; n is a positive integer representing the number of sides of the polygon (4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9); x is a positive integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen (2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5)); y is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number of additional vertices you can choose (y = 0).**
