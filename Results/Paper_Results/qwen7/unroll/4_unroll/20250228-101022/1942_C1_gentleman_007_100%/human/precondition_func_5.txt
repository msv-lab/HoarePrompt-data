n is an integer representing the number of sides of the polygon, m is an integer representing the number of vertices Bessie has chosen, and the function `func_1()` returns two integers x and y which represent the vertices Bessie has chosen such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ n and x ≠ y. Additionally, 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ m ≤ min(n, 2 * 10^5), and m is the length of the list returned by `func_1()`.
