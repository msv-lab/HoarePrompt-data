Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are initially set to True; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes `Highest_Prime` as a list of length `num + 1` with all elements set to 0. This does not affect the values of `num` or the `prime` list, which remain as described in the initial state.
