The function reads input from the user, which includes multiple test cases. For each test case, it processes integers representing the number of vertices (n), the range limit for vertex selection (x), and an initial value (y). It then returns a list of integers, where each integer represents a unique vertex chosen by Bessie within the specified range for each test case.
