Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer; `prime[0]` is False, `prime[1]` is False; `Highest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0; `Lowest_Prime` is a list of length `num + 1` where all elements are 0.**

Explanation: The code sets `prime[0]` and `prime[1]` to `False`. All other elements in the `prime`, `Highest_Prime`, and `Lowest_Prime` lists remain unchanged, as they were initially set to `True`, 0, and 0 respectively.
