The function reads input data consisting of t, n, x, and y from standard input. It processes this input where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and the minimum of n or 2 * 10^5, and y is always 0. After processing, the function returns three values: t, n, and x.
