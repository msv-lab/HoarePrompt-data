Reasoning:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the allowed operations. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all input at once and splits it into a list of strings. This is efficient for handling multiple test cases.
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n, a)` is defined to check if it's possible to equalize the water levels.
   - **Initialization**: It calculates the total amount of water (`total_water`) and checks if it's divisible by `n`. If not, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because the sum of water must be divisible by `n` for it to be possible to equalize the water levels.
   - **Target Calculation**: It calculates the target amount of water per container (`target`), which is `total_water // n`.
   - **Redistribution Check**: It iterates through the list of water amounts and accumulates the difference between each container's water amount and the target. If at any point the accumulated difference becomes negative, it means it's impossible to redistribute the water without some container having less than zero water, so it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Given the logic and the constraints, the function correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
