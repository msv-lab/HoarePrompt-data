Postcondition: **`total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, and `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container. The sum of all integers in the list is divisible by `n`, and `total_water % n == 0`**
