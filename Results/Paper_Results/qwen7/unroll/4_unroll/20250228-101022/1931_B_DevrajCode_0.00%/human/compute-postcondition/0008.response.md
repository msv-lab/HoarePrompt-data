Output State: `total_water` is the sum of all integers in list `a`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer represents the amount of water in the corresponding container, `target` is `total_water // n`, `container` is the sum of `(water - target)` for each `water` in list `a`. If any `(water - target)` makes `container` negative during the loop, the loop returns 'No'.
