Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the operations described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program constructs a matrix `mat` where each row is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, but it does not actually perform the required operations to maximize the sum of the matrix elements as specified.

According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix. However, the current implementation simply initializes the matrix with a sequence of numbers and calculates a sum based on a formula, which does not reflect the actual operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

To illustrate, consider a simple 2x2 matrix:

- Initial matrix after initialization:
```
1 2
3 4
```
- Sum: \(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\)

However, according to the problem, we can perform operations to maximize the sum. For example, performing a Type 1 operation on the first row and a Type 2 operation on the first column could result in:
```
4 3
2 1
```
- Sum: \(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\)

This shows that the current implementation does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum, hence it is incorrect.
