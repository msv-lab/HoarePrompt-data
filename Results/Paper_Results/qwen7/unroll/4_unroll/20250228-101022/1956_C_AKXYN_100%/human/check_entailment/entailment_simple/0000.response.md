Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the sum of all elements in an \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations.
2. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
3. The provided solution initializes the matrix with the identity permutation and then performs a series of operations to achieve the desired result.
4. The solution calculates the expected sum of the matrix, which is the sum of the first \(n\) odd numbers multiplied by \(n\). This is derived from the fact that the sum of the first \(k\) odd numbers is \(k^2\).
5. The solution then performs \(n\) Type 1 operations and \(n\) Type 2 operations to ensure every element in the matrix is set to its corresponding position in the sequence from 1 to \(n\).

Given the problem constraints and the provided solution, let's verify the correctness:

- The initial matrix is correctly initialized to the identity permutation.
- The sum calculation is correct as it sums up the first \(n\) odd numbers multiplied by \(n\).
- The operations performed ensure that each element in the matrix is set to its correct value, thus achieving the maximum possible sum.
- The number of operations (2n) is within the allowed limit.

Based on the above reasoning, the provided solution meets all the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
