Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the one used in the loop, which is `_` (a placeholder typically used when the loop variable is not needed).
   - However, the loop's condition depends on the value returned by `int(input())`, which we'll call `t`.

2. **Understand the Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer.
   - Given the constraints, `t` must be within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

3. **Adjust the State:**
   - Since the loop's execution depends on the input value `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within the specified range.
   - The initial state mentions that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is simply ensuring that `t` is within the given range.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500**
