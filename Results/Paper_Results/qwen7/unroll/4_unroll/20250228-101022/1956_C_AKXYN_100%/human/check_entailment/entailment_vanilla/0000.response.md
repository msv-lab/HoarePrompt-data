Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.
2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes an \( n \times n \) matrix `mat` where each element \( a_{i, j} \) is set to \( j \). This ensures that the first column of the matrix is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It calculates the sum of the matrix as \( \sum_{i=1}^{n} (i + 1) \times (2i + 1) \). This sum is derived from the fact that the maximum possible sum is achieved when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - It prints the calculated sum and the number of operations required, which is \( 2n \).
   - It performs \( n \) operations of type 1 (permuting rows) and \( n \) operations of type 2 (permuting columns) to achieve the desired permutations.

3. **Verification**:
   - The sum calculation is correct because each element \( a_{i, j} \) will eventually be part of the sum, and the sum is maximized when each row and column is a permutation of \( 1, 2, \ldots, n \).
   - The number of operations is \( 2n \), which satisfies the constraint.
   - The operations performed ensure that each row and column is a permutation, thus maximizing the sum.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix and uses no more than \( 2n \) operations.

Correctness: **True**
