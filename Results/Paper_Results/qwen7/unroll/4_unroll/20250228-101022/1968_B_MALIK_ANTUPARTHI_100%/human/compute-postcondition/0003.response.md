Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer obtained from input, each iteration of the outer loop modifies variable `k` based on the conditions provided within the nested loop. After all iterations of the outer loop have finished, `k` will hold the final value determined by the last execution of the inner loop for each `i` in the range of `a`. The exact value of `k` depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the outer loop.
