Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, a is an integer obtained from input.**

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `t` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. The precondition that `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) is still valid. The variable `a` now holds the integer value input by the user.
