### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the program and the function summary against the problem description and the provided examples.

#### Problem Description Recap
- We have \( n \) cubes, each showing a value between 1 and 100.
- The cubes are sorted in non-increasing order.
- The first \( k \) cubes are removed.
- We need to determine if the favorite cube (initially at position \( f \)) is among the removed cubes.

#### Program Analysis
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( f \), and \( k \), and the list of values \( a \).

2. **Adjusting Indexes:**
   - The favorite cube index \( f \) and the number of removed cubes \( k \) are adjusted by subtracting 1 to match Python's zero-based indexing.

3. **Sorting the Values:**
   - The values \( a \) are sorted in non-increasing order using `a.sort(reverse=True)`.

4. **Comparing Values:**
   - The value of the favorite cube after sorting is stored in `x`.
   - The value of the \( k \)-th cube after sorting is compared with `x`:
     - If `a[k] > x`, the favorite cube is not removed, so the program prints `'NO'`.
     - If `a[k] < x`, the favorite cube is definitely removed, so the program prints `'YES'`.
     - If `a[k] == x`, the program checks further conditions:
       - If `k` is the last index (`n - 1`), the favorite cube is definitely removed, so the program prints `'YES'`.
       - Otherwise, the program checks if the `(k + 1)`-th cube is less than `x`. If true, the favorite cube is removed, so the program prints `'YES'`. Otherwise, it prints `'MAYBE'`.

#### Verification Against Examples

Let's verify the logic with some examples from the provided test cases:

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `5 2 2`
   - `a = [4, 3, 3, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`
   - `x = 3` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[1] = 3` (second cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[1] == x`, we need to check further:
     - `k = 1` (not the last index, and `a[2] = 3` which is not less than `x`)
     - Output: `MAYBE`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `5 5 3`
   - `a = [4, 2, 1, 3, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[2] = 3` (third cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[2] > x`, Output: `NO`

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `5 5 2`
   - `a = [5, 2, 4, 1, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[1] = 4` (second cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[1] > x`, Output: `NO`

4. **Example 4:**
   - Input: `5 5 5`
   - `a = [1, 2, 5, 4, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[4] = 1` (fifth cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[4] == x` and `k` is the last index, Output: `YES`

5. **Example 5:**
   - Input: `5 5 4`
   - `a = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[3] = 2` (fourth cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[3] > x`, Output: `NO`

6. **Example 6:**
   - Input: `5 5 5`
   - `a = [4, 3, 2, 1, 5]`
   - Sorted: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[4] = 1` (fifth cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[4] == x` and `k` is the last index, Output: `YES`

7. **Example 7:**
   - Input: `6 5 3`
   - `a = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1]`
   - `x = 3` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[2] = 3` (third cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[2] == x`, we need to check further:
     - `k = 2` (not the last index, and `a[3] = 3` which is not less than `x`)
     - Output: `MAYBE`

8. **Example 8:**
   - Input: `10 1 1`
   - `a = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - Sorted: `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
   - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[0] = 1` (first cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[0] == x`, Output: `YES`

9. **Example 9:**
   - Input: `1 1 1`
   - `a = [42]`
   - Sorted: `[42]`
   - `x = 42` (value of the favorite cube)
   - `a[0] = 42` (first cube after sorting)
   - Since `a[0] == x`, Output: `YES`

    - Input: `5 2 3`
    - `a = [2, 2, 1, 1, 2]`
    - Sorted: `[2, 2, 2, 1, 1]`
    - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
    - `a[2] = 2` (third cube after sorting)
    - Since `a[2] > x`, Output: `NO`

    - Input: `2 1 1`
    - `a = [2, 1]`
    - Sorted: `[2, 1]`
    - `x = 1` (value of the favorite cube)
    - `a[0] = 2` (first cube after sorting)
    - Since `a[0] > x`, Output: `NO`

12. **Example 12:**
    - Input: `5 3 1`
    - `a = [3, 3, 2, 3, 2]`
    - Sorted: `[3, 3, 3, 2, 2]`
    - `x = 2` (value of the favorite cube)
    - `a[0] = 3` (first cube after sorting)
