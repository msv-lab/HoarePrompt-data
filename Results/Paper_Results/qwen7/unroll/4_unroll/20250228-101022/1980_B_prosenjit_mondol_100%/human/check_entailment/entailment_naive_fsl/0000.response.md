Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the favorite cube is removed but the next cube in the sorted order has the same value as the favorite cube. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  5 2 2
  4 3 3 2 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  MAYBE
  ```

However, the program outputs `NO` because it checks if the k-th cube is greater than the favorite cube's value. In this case, the sorted array is `[4, 3, 3, 3, 2]`, and the second cube (k=1) is `3`, which is not greater than the favorite cube's value `3`. However, the favorite cube is still removed because the next cube in the sorted order (`3`) is equal to the favorite cube's value.

The program should check if the k-th cube is greater than or equal to the favorite cube's value and also consider the case where the k-th cube is equal to the favorite cube's value but the (k+1)-th cube is less than the favorite cube's value. This is not handled correctly in the current implementation.
