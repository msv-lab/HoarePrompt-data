Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. According to the problem description, Bob wins if the bitwise XOR of the remaining numbers is zero. However, the program simply calculates the sum of half the occurrences of each number plus an additional term based on the parity of the sum of the occurrences of the numbers. This approach does not take into account the actual bitwise XOR operation among the numbers.

For example, consider the input `1 1 1 0`. The correct output should be `1` because if Eve removes one '1', the remaining sequence will have a bitwise XOR of `1 ^ 1 ^ 0 = 0`, resulting in a win for Bob. However, the program incorrectly outputs `1` for this case, which is correct but does not handle more complex scenarios properly.

A correct solution would involve simulating the removal of numbers and checking the bitwise XOR of the remaining sequence to determine the optimal strategy for Bob. The current implementation does not achieve this.
