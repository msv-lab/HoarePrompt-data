Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading four integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - For each test case, the program calculates the number of times Bob can win by summing up the quotients of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s when divided by 2 (`a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2`).
   - It also adds 1 if the sum of the remainders of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s when divided by 2 is exactly 3 (`int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 3)`).

3. **Output**: The program prints the result for each test case, which matches the required output format.

Given the problem description, the logic in the program aligns with the requirement to maximize the number of times Bob can win. The formula used correctly accounts for the optimal removal strategy by Eve to minimize the number of times Alice can win.

Correctness: **True**
