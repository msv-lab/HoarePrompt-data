State: **`t` must be an integer within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, _ is not a variable and does not need to be adjusted**.

Explanation:
- The loop variable `_` is a wildcard that typically represents an unused iterator. It does not affect the loop's execution condition.
- The variable `t` is the only state that needs to be considered because the loop's condition depends on the value of `t`. For the loop to execute, `t` must be an integer within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is within the valid range for the loop to execute.
