Output State: **t is an input integer, 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), after executing the code, `t` is still within this range, and it is now specifically an input integer. The other conditions and constraints remain unchanged.
