Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case, splitting the input into the required variables \(r\), \(w\), \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\).

2. **Initial Comparison**: The function checks if \(a > c\). If true, it prints 'Draw'. This part is correct because if Alice's initial row position is greater than Bob's, no player can force a win since they can only move vertically or diagonally within their respective boundaries.

3. **Key Calculation**: The function calculates \(x\) as half the absolute difference between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\). This is a crucial step in determining the possible moves and whether a player can force a win.

4. **Boundary Checks**: The function then calculates the possible left (`l`) and right (`r`) boundaries for Alice's or Bob's moves. These calculations ensure that the moves stay within the board's boundaries.

5. **Win Condition Check**: 
   - For Alice to win, both \(l \leq b \leq r\) and \(|l - b| \leq x + 1\) and \(|r - b| \leq x + 1\) must hold.
   - For Bob to win, similar conditions are checked but with respect to \(d\).

6. **Output**: The function prints 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob' based on the above conditions. The logic seems to be correctly implemented to handle the win conditions.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the rules and logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function should produce the expected results for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
