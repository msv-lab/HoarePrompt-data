Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of six positive integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. The function returns a result based on the conditions specified for these integers.**

This means the function takes a series of test cases as input, each containing six integers (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b), and processes them according to the given constraints. The function does not return different cases but rather a single output based on the conditions provided for the integers in each test case.
