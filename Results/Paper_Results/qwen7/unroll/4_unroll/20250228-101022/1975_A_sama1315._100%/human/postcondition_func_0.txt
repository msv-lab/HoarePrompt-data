The function accepts a list of positive integers and checks if any substring of the concatenated list (the original list appended to itself) has the same length as the sorted version of the original list. If such a substring is found, it returns 'Yes'; otherwise, it returns 'No'. Given the return postconditions, the function will always return 'No'.
