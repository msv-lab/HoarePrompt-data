### Reasoning

The original assessment correctly identified that the provided `func_1` implementation is flawed. The function does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array to check if the array can be made non-decreasing. Instead, it checks if any part of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, which is not the intended operation.

The suggested corrected version of `func_1` is as follows:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[:i] <= a[i:]:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'
```

This function iterates through all possible split points and checks if the left part of the array is less than or equal to the right part. If such a split point exists, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping. Otherwise, it returns 'No'.

The `func_2` function correctly reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1`.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program is indeed incorrect due to the flawed implementation of `func_1`.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **False**

The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic to determine if the array can be made non-decreasing by splitting and swapping parts.
