You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Mocha likes arrays, so before her departure, Bazoka gave her an array a
consisting of n positive integers as a gift.

Now Mocha wants to know whether array a could become sorted in non-decreasing
order after performing the following operation some (possibly, zero) times:

  * Split the array into two parts — a prefix and a suffix, then swap these two parts. In other words, let a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y+x . Here + denotes the array concatenation operation. 

For example, if a=[3,1,4,1,5] , we can choose x=[3,1] and y=[4,1,5] ,
satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a:= y + x = [4,1,5,3,1] . We can also
choose x=[3,1,4,1,5] and y=[\,] , satisfying a=x+y . Then, we can set a := y+x
= [3,1,4,1,5] . Note that we are not allowed to choose x=[3,1,1] and y=[4,5] ,
neither are we allowed to choose x=[1,3] and y=[5,1,4] , as both these choices
do not satisfy a=x+y .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\leq t\leq 1000 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2\leq n\leq 50 )
— the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n
(1\leq a_i \leq 10^6 ) — the elements of array a .

Output

For each test case, output "Yes" if a could become non-decreasing after
performing the operation any number of times, and output "No" if not.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes",
"Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive response).

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1 1 4 5 1 4
    
    5
    
    7 9 2 2 3
    
    3
    
    1 2 3

Output

    No
    Yes
    Yes
    
Note

In the first test case, it can be proven that a cannot become non-decreasing
after performing the operation any number of times.

In the second test case, we can perform the following operations to make a
sorted in non-decreasing order:

  * Split the array into two parts: x=[7] and y=[9,2,2,3] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x = [9,2,2,3,7] . 
  * Split the array into two parts: x=[9] and y=[2,2,3,7] , then swap these two parts. The array will become y+x=[2,2,3,7,9] , which is non-decreasing.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1` Analysis
1. **Purpose**: This function checks if the array `a` can be made non-decreasing by splitting it into two parts and swapping them.
2. **Steps**:
   - Calculate the length of the array `n`.
   - Create a sorted version of the array `sorted_a`.
   - Concatenate the original array with itself to form `concatenated_a`.
   - Iterate through all possible splits of `concatenated_a` and check if any split matches `sorted_a`.

**Issue**:
- The logic in `func_1` is flawed. It does not correctly simulate the operation of splitting and swapping parts of the array. Instead, it checks if any part of the concatenated array matches the sorted array, which is not the intended operation.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis
1. **Purpose**: This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
2. **Steps**:
   - Read all input at once using `sys.stdin.read`.
   - Parse the input to extract the number of test cases `t`, the size of each array `n`, and the elements of each array.
   - For each test case, call `func_1` and store the result.
   - Print the results for all test cases.

**Issue**:
- While the input parsing logic in `func_2` is correct, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented to solve the problem as described.

### Correct Solution
To correctly solve the problem, we need to check if the array can be split and swapped to become non-decreasing. A correct approach would involve checking if there exists a split point such that the left part is non-decreasing and the right part is non-decreasing, and the right part is greater than or equal to the left part at the split point.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func_1(a):
    n = len(a)
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[:i] <= a[i:]:
            return 'Yes'
    return 'No'

def func_2():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    idx = 0
    t = int(data[idx])
    idx += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        result = func_1(a)
        results.append(result)
    print('\n'.join(results))

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    func_2()
```

### Conclusion
The given program is incorrect because `func_1` does not correctly implement the required logic. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
