t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; each constraint is represented by a pair of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9; there is at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2; no two constraints are the same.
