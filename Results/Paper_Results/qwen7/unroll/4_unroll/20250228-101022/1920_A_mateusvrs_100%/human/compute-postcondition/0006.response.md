Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but processes a set of constraints defined within its scope. It returns a result based on the constraints provided, which include an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of test cases, an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of constraints, and n pairs of integers (a, x) where a can be 1, 2, or 3, and x ranges from 1 to 10^9. The function evaluates these constraints to determine a specific outcome.**
