Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 500\). Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjust the state**: Since the only variable in the loop head is `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0. Given the constraints, `t` can be any value from 1 to 500, which inherently means it is greater than 0.

4. **Consider other states**: The other variables (`n` and `r`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `t` being greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
