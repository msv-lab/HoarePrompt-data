Reasoning:
The provided program appears to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the steps and their correctness:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct and aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Processing Constraints**:
   - It initializes `ax` to a large value (`1000000007`) and `bx` to `-1`.
   - For each constraint, it updates `bx` for type 1 constraints (where `k` must be greater than or equal to `x`) and `ax` for type 2 constraints (where `k` must be less than or equal to `x`).
   - It adds values for type 3 constraints (where `k` must not equal `x`) to a set `cx`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - If `bx` is greater than `ax`, it means there is no overlap between the ranges, so the answer is `0`. This is correct.
   - Otherwise, it counts how many values in `cx` fall within the range `[bx, ax]` and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range `[ax - bx + 1]`. This ensures that only the valid integers are counted.

4. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list `r` and printed at the end. This is correct and matches the problem requirements.

Given the detailed explanation and the alignment with the problem statement, the program should work correctly under the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
