You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's break down the solution step-by-step to verify its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store results for each test case.
   - `cx` is a set to store values of `x` where `k` must not be equal to `x`.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (10^9 + 7) to ensure any valid lower bound will update it.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to ensure any valid upper bound will update it.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of constraints.
   - We iterate over each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, we update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`. This ensures `k` is at least `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, we update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. This ensures `k` is at most `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, we add `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures `k` cannot be `x`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, we check if `bx > ax`. If so, it means there is no feasible `k`, and we append `0` to `r`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - `ax - bx + 1` gives the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.
     - We subtract the count of elements in `cx` that lie within this range from `ax - bx + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, we print the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values.
- The use of sets to store `cx` ensures unique values are considered.
- The checks for feasibility (`bx > ax`) are correctly implemented.
- The calculation of valid `k` values is accurate.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
