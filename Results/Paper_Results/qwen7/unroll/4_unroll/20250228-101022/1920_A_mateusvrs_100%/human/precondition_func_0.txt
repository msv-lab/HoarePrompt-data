t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The following n lines contain pairs of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, representing the constraints on the integer k. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same.
