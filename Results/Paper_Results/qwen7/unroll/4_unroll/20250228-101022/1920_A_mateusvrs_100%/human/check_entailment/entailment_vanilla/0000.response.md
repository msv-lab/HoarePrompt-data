Let's break down the solution step-by-step to verify its correctness:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `t` is the number of test cases.
   - `r` is initialized as an empty list to store results for each test case.
   - `cx` is a set to store values of `x` where `k` must not be equal to `x`.
   - `ax` is initialized to a large value (10^9 + 7) to ensure any valid lower bound will update it.
   - `bx` is initialized to -1 to ensure any valid upper bound will update it.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, `n` is the number of constraints.
   - We iterate over each constraint:
     - If `a == 1`, we update `bx` to be the maximum of `x` and `bx`. This ensures `k` is at least `x`.
     - If `a == 2`, we update `ax` to be the minimum of `x` and `ax`. This ensures `k` is at most `x`.
     - If `a == 3`, we add `x` to the set `cx`. This ensures `k` cannot be `x`.

3. **Checking Feasibility**:
   - After processing all constraints, we check if `bx > ax`. If so, it means there is no feasible `k`, and we append `0` to `r`.
   - Otherwise, we calculate the number of valid `k` values:
     - `ax - bx + 1` gives the total number of integers between `bx` and `ax` inclusive.
     - We subtract the count of elements in `cx` that lie within this range from `ax - bx + 1`.

4. **Output**:
   - Finally, we print the results for each test case.

### Analysis:

- The logic correctly handles the constraints and calculates the number of valid `k` values.
- The use of sets to store `cx` ensures unique values are considered.
- The checks for feasibility (`bx > ax`) are correctly implemented.
- The calculation of valid `k` values is accurate.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the provided solution appears to be correct.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
