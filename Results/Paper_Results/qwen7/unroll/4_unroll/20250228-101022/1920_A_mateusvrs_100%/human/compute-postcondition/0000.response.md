Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The following n lines contain pairs of integers (a, x) where a ∈ {1, 2, 3} and 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9, representing the constraints on the integer k. There is at least one constraint of type 1 and one constraint of type 2, and no two constraints are the same; `t` is now set to the integer input value.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. The conditions for `t` remain the same, and the value of `n` and the subsequent constraints are yet to be determined by the input.
