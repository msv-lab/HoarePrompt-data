Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' printed based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. Specifically, for each pair (a, b) entered, if either a or b is odd and both are odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, the output will be 'NO'. Otherwise, the output will be 'YES'. The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the input pairs provided during the loop's execution.
