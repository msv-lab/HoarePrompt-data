The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \( n \) and \( k \) (with \( 1 \leq k \leq n \leq 10^9 \)). It then calculates and prints a specific value based on these inputs. The function outputs \( t \) values, one for each test case provided, following the specified conditions.
