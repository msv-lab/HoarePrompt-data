Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `m`**: The variable `m` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is not used correctly in the context of the problem. This calculation is not relevant to the logic needed to solve the problem.

2. **Missing Logic to Track Cards**: The program does not properly track which cards are laid down in the specified order. It seems to be trying to simulate the process but fails to do so correctly.

3. **Incorrect Use of `L` and `tot`**: The list `L` is never populated with any values, and the variables `tot` and `pow` are not used correctly to determine the k-th card.

4. **Break Condition in Loop**: The loop that tries to find the k-th card is flawed because it does not correctly handle the order in which cards are laid down.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while count < k:
            if i % 2 == 1:  # Check if the number is odd
                count += 1
                if count == k:
                    print(i)
            i += 1
            # Add multiples of 2, 3, 4, etc. of odd numbers
            j = 2
            while True:
                multiple = j * i
                if multiple > n:
                    break
                count += 1
                if count == k:
                    print(multiple)
                j += 1

func()
```

This corrected version properly simulates the process of laying down the cards according to the rules provided.
