### Reasoning:

The original assessment identified several critical issues with the provided program:

1. **Incorrect Function Call**: The function `func_1()` is called with `n` and `k` instead of `n` and `m`.
2. **Incorrect Logic**: The logic inside `func_1()` does not address the condition \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Instead, it seems to be calculating something related to the square root of `n`.

The annotated code further confirms these issues by showing that the function `func_1()` is not correctly implementing the required logic. Specifically, the loop and calculations within `func_1()` do not match the problem requirements.

Given the corrected program provided in the original assessment, it correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy the given conditions. The corrected program iterates over all possible pairs \((a, b)\) and checks if \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

### Final Evaluation:

Since the original program does not correctly implement the required logic and the function call parameters are incorrect, the original assessment is accurate.

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect based on the problem description and the original assessment.
