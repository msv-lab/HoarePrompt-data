Reasoning:
1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m` from the input.
3. The function `func_1()` is called with `n` and `m` as arguments, but the function definition only takes one argument `n`. This means that `func_1()` should be modified to take two arguments, `n` and `m`.
4. The function calculates `ans` using the formula \( n + \sum_{i=2}^{\sqrt{n}} \left\lfloor \frac{n + i}{i^2} \right\rfloor \). However, the problem statement requires checking pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
5. The current implementation does not consider the second integer `m` and the condition involving `b`. Therefore, the function does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
