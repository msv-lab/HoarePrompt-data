Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the given problem. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not account for the second parameter `m` and the condition that \(a + b\) must be a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\). Here's a brief breakdown of why it's incorrect:

1. The function `func_1` only takes one integer `k` as input, but the problem requires taking two integers `n` and `m`.
2. The logic inside the function does not check the condition \(a + b\) being a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).
3. The calculation of `ans` does not follow the problem's requirements.

To fix this, you need to:
- Modify the function to accept two parameters `n` and `m`.
- Implement the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and \(a + b\) is a multiple of \(b \cdot \gcd(a, b)\).

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * math.gcd(a, b)) == 0:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```

This version correctly implements the logic to count the valid pairs \((a, b)\) according to the given conditions.
