Reasoning:
1. The provided code does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The main issue lies in the logic used to calculate the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

2. The problem requires calculating the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. 

3. The current implementation only considers the case where `a` is a perfect square and calculates `ans` based on this assumption, which is incorrect. This approach does not cover all possible valid pairs `(a, b)`.

4. The provided code snippet does not include the necessary logic to compute `gcd(a, b)` and check the condition `a + b` being a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` for all valid pairs.

5. The example outputs provided do not match the expected results for the given test cases, indicating that the current implementation is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
