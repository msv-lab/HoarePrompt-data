Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^6, k is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^6**.

Explanation: The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the first and second integers entered by the user, respectively. The variable `t` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it. Therefore, `t` still holds its original value within the specified range, while `n` and `k` are now specific integers read from the input.
