### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases, but it seems to be designed to handle only one test case at a time.
   - It reads `n` (the number of friends) and then reads a list `l` where `l[i]` represents the best friend of the `(i+1)`-th friend.
   - It then iterates over the list `l` to check if there exists a pair `(i, l[i])` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` because these two friends will come to the party.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to check for a pair `(i, l[i])` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is flawed. This condition does not necessarily mean that both friends will come to the party.
   - For example, consider the input `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. The code would incorrectly identify that friends 2 and 4 should be invited (since `l[2-1] = l[1] = 3` and `l[3-1] = l[2] = 2`), but this is not the correct approach.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this correctly, we need to find cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle of length 2, we can invite both friends in the cycle. Otherwise, we need to invite all friends in a cycle of length greater than 2.
   - We can use a union-find data structure or simply track visited friends to detect cycles.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def find_best_friend_cycle(n, p):
    # Initialize a list to keep track of visited friends
    visited = [False] * n
    # Initialize a list to store the cycle
    cycle = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            current = i
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = p[current - 1] - 1
                cycle.append(current + 1)
            
            # Check if the cycle has length 2
            if len(cycle) == 2:
                return 2
            else:
                # Reset for next cycle
                cycle.clear()
    
    # If no cycle of length 2 is found, we need to invite all friends in a cycle of length > 2
    return len(cycle)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        print(find_best_friend_cycle(n, p))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
