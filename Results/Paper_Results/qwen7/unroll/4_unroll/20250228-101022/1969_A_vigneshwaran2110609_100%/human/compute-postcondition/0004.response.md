Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by three values: `t`, `n`, and `p`. `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive, does not equal its index, and all integers in the list are distinct. The function returns information based on the given test case.**

This means the function takes a test case defined by the values of `t`, `n`, and `p` (where `p` is a list), and processes this information according to the specified constraints. It then returns some form of result or information derived from these inputs.
