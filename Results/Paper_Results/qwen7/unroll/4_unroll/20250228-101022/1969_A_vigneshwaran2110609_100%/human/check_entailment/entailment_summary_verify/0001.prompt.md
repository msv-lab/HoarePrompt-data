You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        x = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        for i in range(0, x):
            if l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1:
                flag = True
                print(2)
                break
        else:
            print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by an integer `n`, a list `l` of `n` integers, and implicitly by `t` (which is not used within the function). For each test case, it reads `n` and `l`, then checks if any element `l[i]` in the list satisfies the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such an element is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop. If no such element is found, it prints `3`. The function does not modify the input values and only prints `2` or `3` for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of invitations required so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - A friend will come to the party if both the friend and their best friend (given by `p_i`) receive an invitation.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code:**
   - The code reads multiple test cases, but it seems to be designed to handle only one test case at a time.
   - It reads `n` (the number of friends) and then reads a list `l` where `l[i]` represents the best friend of the `(i+1)`-th friend.
   - It then iterates over the list `l` to check if there exists a pair `(i, l[i])` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1`. If such a pair exists, it prints `2` because these two friends will come to the party.
   - If no such pair exists, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The logic to check for a pair `(i, l[i])` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == i + 1` is flawed. This condition does not necessarily mean that both friends will come to the party.
   - For example, consider the input `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`. The code would incorrectly identify that friends 2 and 4 should be invited (since `l[2-1] = l[1] = 3` and `l[3-1] = l[2] = 2`), but this is not the correct approach.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To solve this correctly, we need to find cycles in the best friend relationships. If there is a cycle of length 2, we can invite both friends in the cycle. Otherwise, we need to invite all friends in a cycle of length greater than 2.
   - We can use a union-find data structure or simply track visited friends to detect cycles.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def find_best_friend_cycle(n, p):
    # Initialize a list to keep track of visited friends
    visited = [False] * n
    # Initialize a list to store the cycle
    cycle = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            current = i
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = p[current - 1] - 1
                cycle.append(current + 1)
            
            # Check if the cycle has length 2
            if len(cycle) == 2:
                return 2
            else:
                # Reset for next cycle
                cycle.clear()
    
    # If no cycle of length 2 is found, we need to invite all friends in a cycle of length > 2
    return len(cycle)

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        print(find_best_friend_cycle(n, p))

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the answer is:
