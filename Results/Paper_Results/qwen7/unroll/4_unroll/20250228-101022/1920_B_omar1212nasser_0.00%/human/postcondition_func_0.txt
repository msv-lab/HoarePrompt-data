The function processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads three integers \( n \), \( k \), and \( x \), and a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. It sorts the list \( a \) and then calls another function `func_2(k, x, a)` to compute a product value based on the sorted list and the given integers. Finally, it prints the computed product for each test case on a new line.
