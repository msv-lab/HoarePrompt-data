You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a 2 \times n grid filled with zeros and ones. Let the number at
the intersection of the i -th row and the j -th column be a_{ij} .

There is a grasshopper at the top-left cell (1, 1) that can only jump one cell
right or downwards. It wants to reach the bottom-right cell (2, n) . Consider
the binary string of length n+1 consisting of numbers written in cells of the
path without changing their order.

Your goal is to:

  1. Find the lexicographically smallest^\dagger string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. Find the number of paths that yield this lexicographically smallest string. 

^\dagger If two strings s and t have the same length, then s is
lexicographically smaller than t if and only if in the first position where s
and t differ, the string s has a smaller element than the corresponding
element in t .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a_{11} a_{12}
\ldots a_{1n} (a_{1i} is either 0 or 1 ).

The third line of each test case contains a binary string a_{21} a_{22} \ldots
a_{2n} (a_{2i} is either 0 or 1 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output two lines:

  1. The lexicographically smallest string you can attain by choosing any available path; 
  2. The number of paths that yield this string.

Note

In the first test case, the lexicographically smallest string is \mathtt{000}
. There are two paths that yield this string:

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n` and the binary strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
   - The program initializes an empty string `ans` to store the result.
   - It uses a boolean variable `work` to switch between appending characters from `a` and `b`.
   - The loop iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If `work` is `True`, it appends the current character from `a` to `ans`.
       - If the next character in `a` is greater than the next character in `b` (when they exist), it switches to `b`.
       - Otherwise, it continues appending from `a`.
     - If `work` is `False`, it appends the current character from `b` to `ans`.
   - This logic ensures that the resulting string is lexicographically smallest by preferring `a` when possible.

3. **Counting Paths:**
   - After generating the lexicographically smallest string, the program counts the number of paths that produce this string.
   - It initializes a counter `counter` to 1.
   - It iterates through the characters of `a` and `b`:
     - If the next character in `a` is the same as the previous character in `b`, it increments the counter.
     - If the next character in `a` is '0' and the previous character in `b` is '1', it resets the counter to 1.
     - Otherwise, it breaks the loop.
   - The counter represents the number of paths that yield the lexicographically smallest string.

### Correctness Check

- **Generating the Lexicographically Smallest String:**
  - The logic correctly ensures that the string is built in a way that minimizes lexicographical order by preferring `a` when possible.
  - The switching logic handles the transition between `a` and `b` correctly.

- **Counting Paths:**
  - The counting logic correctly identifies paths that produce the lexicographically smallest string by tracking the transitions between `a` and `b`.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
