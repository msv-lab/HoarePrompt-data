Output State: t is an integer read from input, within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and remains unchanged; two binary strings `ans`, `a`, and `b` are generated after processing each test case; `counter` is an integer representing the count of consecutive positions where `a[j+1]` equals `b[j]` for each test case.
