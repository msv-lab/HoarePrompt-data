Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of n empty lists representing the adjacency list of the tree**.

Explanation: The code initializes `u2vs` as a list containing `n` empty lists. Each of these empty lists corresponds to the adjacency list for each vertex in the tree. The value of `n` remains unchanged from its initial state, but `u2vs` is now a list of `n` empty lists, indicating that initially, no edges have been added to the tree.
