Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of vertices in the tree, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^3. u2vs is a list of lists representing the adjacency list of the tree, where u2vs[i] is a list of vertices adjacent to vertex i. The input is read from standard input, and the output is printed to standard output.**
