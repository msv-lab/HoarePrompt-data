Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the shortest path distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices, `previous` is a list indicating the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex 0 to each vertex, `n` vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge, `_` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the function `bfs(a)` has been called with `a` as the starting point, which returns two values: `d` (shortest path distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices) and `previous` (a list indicating the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex 0 to each vertex). The values of `n`, `u2vs`, and `_` remain unchanged from the initial state.
