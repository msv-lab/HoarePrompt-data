Output State: **`a` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `b` is the result of `func_1(d)`, `d` is the shortest path distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices, `previous` is a list indicating the previous vertex in the shortest path from vertex 0 to each vertex, `n` vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge, `_` remains unchanged.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `func_1(d)` to both `a` and `b`. The function `func_1(d)` is applied to the same variable `d`, which is the shortest path distances from vertex 0 to all other vertices. All other variables remain unchanged.
