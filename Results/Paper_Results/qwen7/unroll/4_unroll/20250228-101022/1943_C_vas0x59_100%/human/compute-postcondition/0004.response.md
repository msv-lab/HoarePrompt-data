Output State: `n` vertices in the tree, `u2vs` is a list of `n` lists where each list contains the indices of the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex by an edge. The edges are added bidirectionally, meaning if there is an edge between vertex `u` and vertex `v`, both `u2vs[u]` and `u2vs[v]` will include each other.
