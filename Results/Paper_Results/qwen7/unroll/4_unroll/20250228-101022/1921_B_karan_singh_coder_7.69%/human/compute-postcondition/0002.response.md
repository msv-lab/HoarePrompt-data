Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5. After executing the loop, the output is determined based on the conditions within the loop. If the counts of '1's in s and t are equal, the output is the count of differing positions if it is non-zero, otherwise 0. If the counts of '1's are different, the output is half the count of differing positions adjusted by the absolute difference in the counts of '1's.
