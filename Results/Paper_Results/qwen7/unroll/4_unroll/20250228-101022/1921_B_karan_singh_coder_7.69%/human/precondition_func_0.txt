t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, and s and f are strings of length n consisting of '0' and '1', representing the initial and desired positions of the cats in the boxes, respectively. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
