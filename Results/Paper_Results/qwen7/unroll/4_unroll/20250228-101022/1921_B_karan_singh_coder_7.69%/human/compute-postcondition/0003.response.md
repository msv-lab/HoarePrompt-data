Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it receives multiple test cases, each containing a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), and for each t, it processes n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), two strings s and f of length n consisting of '0' and '1'. It returns the minimum number of moves required to transform the initial state represented by string s to the desired state represented by string f.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it takes an integer t indicating the number of test cases, followed by n, the length of the strings s and f, and these strings represent the initial and desired positions of cats in boxes. The function calculates and returns the minimum number of moves needed to change the initial state to the desired state.
