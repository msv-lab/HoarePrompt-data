Reasoning:
The annotated program does not fully capture the logic required to solve the problem correctly. Specifically, the program fails to account for the fact that the maximum number of draws can be calculated based on the scores of the players. Hereâ€™s the detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the initial input `t` and processes each test case.
2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of the scores is even. This is a necessary condition but not sufficient. For instance, if the sum is even but the distribution of points among the players is not possible through valid games, the output should still be `-1`.
3. **Calculation of Maximum Draws**: The program calculates the minimum value between `(a + b + c) // 2` and `a + b`. However, this approach does not accurately determine the maximum number of draws. The correct approach involves checking the feasibility of the scores and calculating the maximum number of draws based on the scores of the players.

To determine the maximum number of draws, we need to consider the following:
- The total points must be even.
- The maximum number of draws is constrained by the scores of the players.
- We need to check if the scores can be achieved through valid games and calculate the maximum number of draws accordingly.

Given these considerations, the annotated program does not correctly implement the solution. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
