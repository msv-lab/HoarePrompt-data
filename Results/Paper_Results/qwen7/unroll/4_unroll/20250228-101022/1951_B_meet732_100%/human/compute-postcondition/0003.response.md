Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 in the `range(n)` function.
   - `n` is the number of iterations the loop will perform.

3. **Understand the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1 (since `i` starts at 0).

4. **Adjust the states of the relevant variables**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0, we don't need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

5. **Consider the other given variables (`ind`, `a`, `c`, and `x`)**:
   - These variables are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Based on this analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` must be greater than 0.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
