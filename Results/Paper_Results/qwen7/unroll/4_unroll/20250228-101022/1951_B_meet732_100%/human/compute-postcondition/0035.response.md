Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of n distinct integers. Based on certain conditions, it returns either n - 1, the value of the k-1th element in the list a, one less than the index stored in `ind[0]`, the value of k, the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` decreased by 1 and the index `k` decreased by 1, or the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]).**

- If the function returns n - 1, it means the length of the list `a` minus one.
- If the function returns the value of x minus 1, it means the value of the k-1th element in the list a.
- If the function returns an integer which is one less than the index stored in `ind[0]`, it means the index stored in `ind[0]` minus one.
- If the function returns the value of k, it means the value of the x-th element in the list a.
- If the function returns the minimum value between the second element of list `ind` decreased by 1 and the index `k` decreased by 1, it means the smaller of the two values.
- If the function returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (ind[1] - ind[0]), given that ind[0] is not 0 and k (the element at index ind[1]) is greater than ind[1], it means the larger of the two values under specific conditions.
- If the function returns the maximum value between (ind[0] - 1) and (k - ind[0]), it means the larger of the two values.
