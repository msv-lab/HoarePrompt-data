Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` with an initial 0 added at the beginning, `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s1` plus one, `totalOne` is the number of elements in the list `pre`.**

Explanation: The code `preOne = list(accumulate(pre, initial=0))` creates a new list `preOne` where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in `pre` starting from 0. The initial state includes that `pre` contains the indices of all '>' characters in `s1` plus one, and `totalOne` is the number of elements in `pre`. The strings `s1` and the list `pre` remain unchanged.
