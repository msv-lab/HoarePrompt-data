Output State: **`preOne` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the corresponding elements in `pre` with an initial 0 added at the beginning, `s1` is a string consisting of characters '<' and '>', `pre` is a list containing the indices of all '>' characters in `s1` plus one, `totalOne` is the number of elements in the list `pre`, `suffZero` is `[0]`**.

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `suffZero` with the value `[0]`. This does not affect the values of `preOne`, `s1`, `pre`, or `totalOne`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
