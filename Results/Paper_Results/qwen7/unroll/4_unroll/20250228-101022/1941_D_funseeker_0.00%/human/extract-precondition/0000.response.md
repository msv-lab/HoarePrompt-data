Precondition: **n is an integer representing the number of players (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000), m is an integer representing the number of throws made (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000), x is an integer representing the initial player who has the ball (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and ans is a set initialized with the player x. The function func_1() returns a string containing the distance r and direction c for each throw, and func_3() returns a tuple (n, m, x).**
