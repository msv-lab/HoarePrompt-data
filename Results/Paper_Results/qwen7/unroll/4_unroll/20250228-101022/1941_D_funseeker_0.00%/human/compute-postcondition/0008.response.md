Based on the initial state, `ans` is a set of integers. The value of `ans` depends on whether `0` is present in it. If `0` is in `ans`, then `n` is added to `ans`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

To determine what will be printed, we need to consider two cases:

1. **Case 1**: If `0` is in `ans`, then `n` is added to `ans`. In this case, the length of `ans` will be 1 more than its original length.
2. **Case 2**: If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged. In this case, the length of `ans` will be the same as its original length.

Since the initial state does not specify whether `0` is in `ans` or the value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact length of `ans`. However, we can describe the possible outcomes.

Output: **len(ans) (where len(ans) is the number of elements in the set ans, which could be the original length if 0 is not in ans, or one more than the original length if 0 is in ans)**
