t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, n, m, and x are integers where 2 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= m <= 1000, and 1 <= x <= n. Each subsequent line contains an integer r_i (1 <= r_i <= n - 1) and a character c_i ('0', '1', or '?') representing the distance and direction of the throw, respectively.
