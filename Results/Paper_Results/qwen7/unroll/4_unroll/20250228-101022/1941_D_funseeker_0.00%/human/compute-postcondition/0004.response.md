Postcondition: **`ans` is a set of integers resulting from applying the operations defined by `c` within the inner loop for `m` iterations, starting with the initial elements in `ans`. Each element in `ans` is updated based on adding or subtracting `r` modulo `n` depending on the value of `c`. The operations are applied repeatedly for each element in `ans` during each iteration of the outer loop. The current value of `0` is present in the set `ans`.**
