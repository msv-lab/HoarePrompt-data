Let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is a set of integers.
   - If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` includes `n`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given this, we need to determine what `ans` will contain after the initial state conditions are applied.

- The initial state does not specify any particular value for `n` or explicitly state whether `0` is in `ans`.
- Therefore, we must consider both possibilities:
  - If `0` is in `ans`, then `ans` will include `n`.
  - If `0` is not in `ans`, then `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact value of `n` is not specified, we cannot provide a specific numerical value for `ans`. However, we can describe the contents of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output: **0 and n (if 0 is in ans), or just n (if 0 is not in ans)**
