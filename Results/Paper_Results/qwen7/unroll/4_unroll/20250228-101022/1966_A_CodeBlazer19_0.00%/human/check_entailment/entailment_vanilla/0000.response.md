Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`.
   - It then reads a list of `n` integers representing the numbers on the cards.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - The program only prints `k - 1` for each test case without considering the actual numbers on the cards or performing any operations as specified in the problem statement.

3. **Problem Description Recap:**
   - The goal is to minimize the number of cards by exchanging groups of `k` identical cards for `k-1` new cards.
   - The program should consider the frequency of each card number and perform exchanges optimally to achieve the minimum number of cards.

4. **Checking the Given Program:**
   - The program does not account for the actual values of the cards or their frequencies.
   - It simply prints `k - 1` for every test case, which is not a correct approach according to the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. It always outputs `k - 1`, regardless of the input values, which is not the intended behavior.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
