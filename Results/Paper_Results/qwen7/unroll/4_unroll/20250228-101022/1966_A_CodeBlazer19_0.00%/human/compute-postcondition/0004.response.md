Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes a series of test cases. Each test case includes an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500), followed by pairs of integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ k ≤ 100), and a list of n integers (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 100). For each test case, it returns a result based on the given parameters.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters and a list of numbers. It processes these inputs according to certain rules but does not return a single value directly; instead, it provides results for each test case individually.
