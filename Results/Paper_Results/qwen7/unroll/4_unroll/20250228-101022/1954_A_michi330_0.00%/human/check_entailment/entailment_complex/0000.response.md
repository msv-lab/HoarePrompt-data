Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. The program checks two conditions:
   - `n <= k`: If the total number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, then Bob can always repaint all parts to the same color, so Alice cannot prevent this. Therefore, the program prints 'NO'.
   - `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k`: This condition checks if the number of parts that need to be painted differently to ensure Bob cannot make all parts the same color is less than `k`. If this is true, Alice can achieve her goal, so the program prints 'YES'.
4. The logic in the program is consistent with the problem statement and the examples provided.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
