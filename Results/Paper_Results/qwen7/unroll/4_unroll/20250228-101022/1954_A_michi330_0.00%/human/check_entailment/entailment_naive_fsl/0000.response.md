Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `m` (the number of colors) is greater than `k` (the number of parts Bob can repaint). According to the problem description, if `m > k`, Alice can always paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. However, the current implementation checks if `n <= k` or `n - math.ceil(n / m) < k` to determine if Alice can achieve her goal. This logic is incorrect because it does not account for the scenario where `m > k`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
3
5 3 2
5 4 2
5 5 2
```

- For the first test case `(5, 3, 2)`, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' because `5 - math.ceil(5 / 3) = 2`, which is not less than `2`. However, since `m = 3 > k = 2`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- For the second test case `(5, 4, 2)`, the program incorrectly prints 'NO' because `5 - math.ceil(5 / 4) = 2`, which is not less than `2`. However, since `m = 4 > k = 2`, Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.
- For the third test case `(5, 5, 2)`, the program correctly prints 'YES' because `m = 5 > k = 2`.

To fix this, the condition should be adjusted to check if `m > k` directly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for itest in range(0, t, 1):
        (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
        if m > k:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
```

This corrected version ensures that the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.
