Output State: **The program returns 1000000001**

Explanation: Based on the initial state, `tmp` is given as 1000000000. The code snippet `return tmp + 1` calculates the value of `tmp + 1`, which results in 1000000001. Since no other operations affect `tmp` or modify its value before the return statement, the program returns this calculated value.
