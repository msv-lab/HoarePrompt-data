The function `func_13` accepts two non-negative integer parameters `a` and `b`, with specific constraints. Depending on the value of `b`, it either returns `x` as 1, `y` as 0, and `a` within the range of 1 to `n`, or it returns `y`, `x - a // b * y`, and `g`, where `y`, `x`, and `g` are the results from a recursive call to `func_13(b, a % b)`.
