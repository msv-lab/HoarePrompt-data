Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6 and 1 ≤ i ≤ m and i^2 ≤ n + i after calling `func_7()` which assigns new values to `n` and `m`.**

Explanation: The code initializes `i` to 1. Since `n` and `m` were positive integers before the execution of this line and the condition `1 ≤ i ≤ m and i^2 ≤ n + i` must hold after calling `func_7()`, these conditions remain valid. The value of `i` is now explicitly set to 1.
