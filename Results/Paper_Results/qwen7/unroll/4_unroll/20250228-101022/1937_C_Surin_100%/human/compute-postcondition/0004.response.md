Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after all iterations, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after all iterations. These values are determined based on the comparisons made within the loop and the responses received from the input.

In the loop, `v1` is updated when the response is '<', and `prev` is updated when the response is '>'. If both `v1` and `prev` are equal at any point, the loop continues until the final comparison where the value of `prev` and `v1` are printed as the output.
