You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
This is an interactive problem.

There is a secret sequence p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} , which is a permutation
of \\{0,1,\ldots,n-1\\} .

You need to find any two indices i and j such that p_i \oplus p_j is
maximized, where \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

To do this, you can ask queries. Each query has the following form: you pick arbitrary indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d < n ). Next, the jury calculates x = (p_a \mid p_b) and y = (p_c \mid p_d) , where | denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR). Finally, you receive the result of comparison between x and y . In other words, you are told if x < y , x > y , or x = y .

Please find any two indices i and j (0 \le i,j < n ) such that p_i \oplus p_j
is maximum among all such pairs, using at most 3n queries. If there are
multiple pairs of indices satisfying the condition, you may output any one of
them.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The description of the test cases follows.

Interaction

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).
At this moment, the permutation p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_{n-1} is chosen. The
interactor in this task is not adaptive. In other words, the sequence p is
fixed in every test case and does not change during the interaction.

To ask a query, you need to pick four indices a , b , c , and d (0 \le a,b,c,d
< n ) and print the line of the following form:

  * "? a b c d" 

After that, you receive:

  * "<" if (p_a \mid p_b) < (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * "=" if (p_a \mid p_b) = (p_c \mid p_d) ; 
  * ">" if (p_a \mid p_b) > (p_c \mid p_d) . 

You can make at most 3n queries of this form.

Next, if your program has found a pair of indices i and j (0 \le i, j < n )
such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized, print the line of the following form:

  * "! i j" 

Note that this line is not considered a query and is not taken into account
when counting the number of queries asked.

After this, proceed to the next test case.

If you make more than 3n queries during an interaction, your program must
terminate immediately, and you will receive the Wrong Answer verdict.
Otherwise, you can get an arbitrary verdict because your solution will
continue to read from a closed stream.

After printing a query or the answer for a test case, do not forget to output
the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get the verdict
Idleness Limit Exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^4 .

Hacks

To hack, follow the test format below.

The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^3 ). The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 10^4 ).

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_{n-1} ,
which represent a permutation of integers from 0 to n - 1 .

The sum of n over all test cases should not exceed 10^4 .

Example

Input

    2
    4
    
    <
    
    =
    
    >
    
    2
    
Output

    ? 0 2 3 1
    
    ? 1 1 2 3
    
    ? 1 2 0 3
    
    ! 3 2
    
    ! 0 1
    
Note

In the first test case, the hidden permutation is p=[0,3,1,2] .

For the query "? 0 2 3 1", the jury return "<" because (p_0 \mid p_2) = (0
\mid 1) =1 < (p_3 \mid p_1) = (2 \mid 3) = 3 .

For the query "? 1 1 2 3", the jury return "=" because (p_1 \mid p_1) = (3\mid
3)= 3 = (p_2 \mid p_3) = (1 \mid 2)=3 .

For the query "? 1 2 0 3", the jury return ">" because (p_1 \mid p_2) = (3
\mid 1) = 3 > (p_0 \mid p_3) = (0\mid 2)=2 .

The answer i = 3 and j = 2 is valid: (p_3 \oplus p_2) = (2 \oplus 1) = 3 is
indeed equal to the maximum possible value of p_i \oplus p_j . Another valid
answer would be i=0 and j=1 . As the number of queries does not exceed 3n=12 ,
the answer is considered correct.

In the second test case, n = 2 , so p is either [0, 1] or [1, 0] . In any
case, p_0 \oplus p_1 = 1 is maximum possible.

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of two integers separated by a space. The first integer represents the value of `prev` after all iterations, and the second integer represents the value of `v1` after all iterations. These values are determined based on the comparisons made within the loop and the responses received from the input.
    #
    #In the loop, `v1` is updated when the response is '<', and `prev` is updated when the response is '>'. If both `v1` and `prev` are equal at any point, the loop continues until the final comparison where the value of `prev` and `v1` are printed as the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function performs a series of queries to determine the relative order of elements in an unknown permutation of numbers from 0 to n-1. It iteratively updates two variables, `v1` and `prev`, based on the responses received from these queries. After completing the iterations, it prints the final values of `prev` and `v1`. The function does not accept any parameters and returns no value.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided program to determine if it correctly solves the problem according to the given specifications.

### Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find two indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized.
   - We can query the interactor with four indices \(a, b, c, d\) and get a comparison result between \((p_a \mid p_b)\) and \((p_c \mid p_d)\).
   - We have at most \(3n\) queries to achieve this.

2. **Program Structure:**
   - The program uses a function `func()` to handle the interaction.
   - It reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables and performs queries to identify the optimal pair of indices.

3. **Query Strategy:**
   - The program starts by comparing pairs of indices \((v1, v1)\) and \((v2, v2)\) for \(v1 = 0\) and \(v2 = i\) for \(i = 1\) to \(n-1\).
   - This helps in identifying a candidate index \(v1\) that might lead to a high XOR value.
   - Then, it compares \(v1\) with other indices to find a potential second index \(prev\) that maximizes the XOR value.
   - Finally, it prints the indices \(prev\) and \(v1\) as the answer.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Initialization and First Query Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\), comparing \((v1, v1)\) and \((i, i)\) for each \(i\).
   - If the result is `<`, it updates \(v1 = i\). This step seems to be an attempt to find an index that might maximize the XOR value when combined with another index.

2. **Second Query Loop:**
   - The loop iterates from 1 to \(n-1\) again, comparing \(v1\) with each index \(i\).
   - If the result is `>`, it updates \(prev = i\). This step aims to find an index \(prev\) that, when combined with \(v1\), gives a higher XOR value.
   - If the result is `=`, it performs an additional check to ensure correctness.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The program prints the indices \(prev\) and \(v1\) as the final answer.

### Issues and Correctness:

1. **Query Strategy:**
   - The strategy of comparing \((v1, v1)\) and \((i, i)\) for each \(i\) is flawed. It does not necessarily help in finding the optimal pair of indices.
   - The logic of updating \(v1\) and \(prev\) based on the results of these comparisons is also problematic. It does not guarantee that the final pair \((prev, v1)\) will maximize the XOR value.

2. **Number of Queries:**
   - The program makes \(2(n-1)\) queries in the first loop and up to \(n-1\) queries in the second loop, totaling \(3n-3\) queries. This is close but not guaranteed to be within the \(3n\) limit.

3. **Correctness:**
   - The program does not correctly implement the strategy to find the optimal pair of indices that maximizes the XOR value. It relies on a flawed heuristic that does not guarantee the correct result.

### Conclusion:

Given the issues in the query strategy and the potential for exceeding the query limit, the provided program is **incorrect**.

**Correctness: **False**
