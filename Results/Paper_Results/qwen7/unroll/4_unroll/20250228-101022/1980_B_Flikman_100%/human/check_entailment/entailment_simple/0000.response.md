Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `f`, and `k`.
3. It then reads the list of integers `a` representing the values on the cubes.
4. The program sorts the list `a` in non-increasing order.
5. It counts how many times the favorite value appears in the sorted list.
6. It also counts how many times the favorite value is removed in the first `k` positions of the sorted list.
7. Based on these counts, it determines whether the favorite cube will be removed, not removed, or if it might be either.
8. The logic for determining the output is correct:
   - If the number of times the favorite value is removed equals the total count of the favorite value, it prints 'YES'.
   - If the favorite value is never removed, it prints 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'MAYBE'.

Given the above reasoning, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
