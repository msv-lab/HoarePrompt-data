Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the favorite cube is not among the first `k` cubes after sorting but is still removed because it appears later in the sorted list more than once. Specifically, the program checks if the number of times the favorite value appears in the first `k` cubes is equal to the total number of times it appears in the sorted list. However, this logic is flawed because it does not account for the possibility that the favorite cube might be removed even if it appears fewer times than its total occurrences in the sorted list.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5 2 2
4 3 3 2 3
```
- Expected Output: `YES` (since the favorite cube with value 3 ends up in the second position and will be removed)
- Program Output: `NO` (because the program incorrectly counts the occurrences and does not correctly determine if the favorite cube will be removed)

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not handle all potential cases correctly, hence the correctness is **False**.
