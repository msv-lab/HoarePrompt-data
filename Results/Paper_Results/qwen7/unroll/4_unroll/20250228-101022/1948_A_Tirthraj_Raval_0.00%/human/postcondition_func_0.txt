The function reads a positive integer `t` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads another positive integer `n`. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is even, it prints 'YES' followed by a pattern consisting of alternating 'A' and 'B' characters repeated `n//2` times. The function does not return any value.
