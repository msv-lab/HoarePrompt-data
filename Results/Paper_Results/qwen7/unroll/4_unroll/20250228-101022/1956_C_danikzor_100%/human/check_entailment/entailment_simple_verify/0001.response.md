### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step and compare it with the requirements and the original assessment.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to maximize the sum of an \(n \times n\) matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations.
   - There are two types of operations:
     - Type 1: Permute the elements of a chosen row.
     - Type 2: Permute the elements of a chosen column.
   - The goal is to achieve the maximum possible sum of the matrix elements.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix using the formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\).
   - It prints the calculated maximum sum and the number of operations required, which is \(2n\).
   - It then performs \(n\) operations of type 1 and \(n\) operations of type 2, where each operation sets the entire row or column to a descending permutation of numbers from \(n\) to \(1\).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - The formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\) is derived from the properties of permutations and the structure of the matrix. However, let's verify if this formula is correct.
   - For a matrix with elements set to descending permutations, each element \(a_{i,j}\) will be at most \(n\). Therefore, the maximum possible sum of the matrix is \(n \times n \times n = n^3\).
   - The formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\) does not simplify to \(n^3\). Instead, it simplifies to:
     \[
     \frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}
     \]
   - This formula is not the correct maximum sum for the matrix. The correct maximum sum should be \(n^3\).

4. **Operations Analysis**:
   - The operations performed (permuting each row and each column to descending order) ensure that every element in the matrix reaches its maximum possible value of \(n\).
   - However, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum is \(n^3\), not \(\frac{n(n+1)(4n-1)}{6}\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program correctly performs the required operations to set each row and column to descending order, but the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect.
   - Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem because it uses an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.
