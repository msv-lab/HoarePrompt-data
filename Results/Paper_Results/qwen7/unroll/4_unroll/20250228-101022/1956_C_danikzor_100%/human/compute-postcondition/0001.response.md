Output: **(n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6, 2 * n)**

Explanation:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, but it is not used in the print statement.
- `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 500.
- The expression `n * (n + 1) * (4 * n - 1) // 6` calculates a specific mathematical formula involving `n`.
- The expression `2 * n` simply doubles the value of `n`.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the mathematical formula and the doubled value of `n` in the specified format.
