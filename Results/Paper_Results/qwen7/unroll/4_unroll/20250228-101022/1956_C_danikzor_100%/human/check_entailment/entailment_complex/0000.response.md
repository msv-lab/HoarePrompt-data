Reasoning:
- The problem requires maximizing the sum of the elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
- The provided program attempts to achieve this by performing \( 2n \) operations, each setting the entire row or column to a specific permutation.
- Specifically, for each row \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), it performs two operations:
  - A Type 1 operation that sets the entire row \( i \) to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
  - A Type 2 operation that sets the entire column \( i \) to the permutation \([n, n-1, \ldots, 1]\).
- The sum of the matrix after these operations will be maximized because each element \( a_{i,j} \) will be set to its maximum possible value of \( n \) (since each position will be filled with the largest available number from 1 to \( n \)).
- The formula \( \frac{n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1)}{6} \) is derived from the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers repeated \( n \) times (once for each row and column), which is indeed the maximum possible sum for an \( n \times n \) matrix under these constraints.
- The program correctly outputs the maximum sum and the required number of operations, which is \( 2n \).

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
