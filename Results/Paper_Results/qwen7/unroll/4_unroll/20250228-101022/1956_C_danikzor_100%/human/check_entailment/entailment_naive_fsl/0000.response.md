Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. According to the problem description, the goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in the \(n \times n\) matrix using at most \(2n\) operations. The program attempts to achieve this by performing \(2n\) operations, but the way it assigns values to the matrix does not necessarily lead to the maximum possible sum.

Let's analyze the program:
- The program calculates the sum as \(n \cdot (n + 1) \cdot (4n - 1) // 6\) and prints \(2n\) operations.
- In each operation, it sets both rows and columns to a descending sequence from \(n\) to \(1\).

However, this approach does not guarantee that the sum will be maximized. For example, consider a \(2 \times 2\) matrix:
- If we set both rows and columns to \([2, 1]\), the resulting matrix would be:
  ```
  2 1
  2 1
  ```
  The sum of this matrix is \(2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6\).

But the maximum possible sum for a \(2 \times 2\) matrix is actually \(4\) if we set the matrix to:
  ```
  2 2
  2 2
  ```
  This can be achieved by setting both rows and columns to \([2, 2]\).

The program's approach of setting each row and column to a descending sequence does not ensure that the maximum sum is achieved. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
