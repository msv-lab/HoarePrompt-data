### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of the matrix \(a\) using at most \(2n\) operations, where each operation can either permute the rows or columns.
   - The maximum sum of the matrix can be achieved by setting each element \(a_{i,j}\) to its maximum possible value, which is \(n\).

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The solution starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the matrix `n`.
   - It then calculates the maximum possible sum of the matrix and prints it along with the number of operations required.
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum sum \(s\) is \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\).
   - It also prints \(2n\) operations, which are of type 1 and type 2, respectively, where each operation sets the entire row or column to a descending permutation of numbers from \(n\) to \(1\).

3. **Checking the Correctness**:
   - The formula \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\) is derived from the properties of permutations and the structure of the matrix. However, this formula is incorrect for calculating the maximum sum of the matrix. The correct formula for the maximum sum is simply \(n^2 \times n = n^3\), because each of the \(n^2\) elements can be set to \(n\).
   - The operations performed (permuting each row and each column to descending order) ensure that every element in the matrix reaches its maximum possible value, which is \(n\). This is correct.
   - However, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. The correct maximum sum is \(n^3\), not \(n \times (n + 1) \times (4n - 1) / 6\).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - While the operations performed are correct and adhere to the requirement of using no more than \(2n\) operations, the formula used to calculate the maximum sum is incorrect. Therefore, the overall correctness of the program is affected by this error.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect due to the use of an incorrect formula to calculate the maximum sum of the matrix.
