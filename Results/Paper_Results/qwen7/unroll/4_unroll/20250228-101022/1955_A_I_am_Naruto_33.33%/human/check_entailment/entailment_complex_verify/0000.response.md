### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the annotated code step-by-step to determine if the original assessment is accurate.

#### Given Program:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if n > 1:
            ans1 = a * n
            ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2
            print(min(ans1, ans2))
        else:
            print(a)
```

#### Annotated Code:
The annotated code correctly describes the behavior of the given function. It processes each test case by splitting the input into `n`, `a`, and `b`. Then, it calculates two possible costs:
1. `ans1 = a * n`: The cost if each yogurt is bought individually.
2. `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: The cost if pairs of yogurts are bought using the promotion price, and any remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.

Finally, it prints the minimum of these two costs.

#### Original Assessment:
The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more beneficial than buying individually. Specifically, it mentions that in the third test case (3 5 11), the program incorrectly calculates the cost as 16 burles instead of 15 burles.

However, upon closer inspection, the given program actually does handle the case correctly. Let's break down the calculation for the third test case (3 5 11):

- `n = 3`
- `a = 5`
- `b = 11`

1. Calculate `ans1`:
   \[
   ans1 = a \times n = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

2. Calculate `ans2`:
   - Number of pairs: `n // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1`
   - Remaining single yogurt: `n % 2 = 3 % 2 = 1`
   \[
   ans2 = b \times (n // 2) + a \times (n % 2) = 11 \times 1 + 5 \times 1 = 11 + 5 = 16
   \]

3. Print the minimum of `ans1` and `ans2`:
   \[
   \min(15, 16) = 15
   \]

Thus, the program correctly outputs 15 burles for the third test case.

The original assessment is incorrect because the program does handle the case where buying in pairs using the promotion price is more beneficial than buying individually.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
