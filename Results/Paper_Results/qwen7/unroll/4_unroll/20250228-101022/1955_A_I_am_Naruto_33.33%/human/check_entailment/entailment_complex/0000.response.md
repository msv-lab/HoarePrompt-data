Reasoning:
- The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
- If `n` is greater than 1, the program calculates two possible costs:
  - `ans1 = a * n`: the cost if each yogurt is bought at the regular price.
  - `ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`: the cost if the maximum number of pairs of yogurts are bought at the promotional price, and the remaining single yogurt is bought at the regular price.
- The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated values.
- If `n` is 1, the program simply prints the cost of buying one yogurt at the regular price (`a`).

Given the problem statement and the provided annotated program, the logic implemented in the function appears to be correct. The program handles all edge cases (e.g., when `n` is 1) and computes the minimum cost accurately for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
