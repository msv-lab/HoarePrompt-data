Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum cost for Maxim to buy exactly `n` yogurts considering both the regular price and the promotional price for two yogurts. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases and then processes each test case individually.
2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the cost if all yogurts were bought at the regular price (`ans1 = a * n`).
   - It also calculates the cost if the maximum number of pairs (of two yogurts) are bought at the promotional price and any remaining single yogurt at the regular price (`ans2 = b * n // 2 + a * n % 2`).
3. **Output**: The program prints the minimum of these two calculated costs.

The logic ensures that Maxim gets the best deal by either buying all yogurts at the regular price or taking advantage of the promotion where applicable. This approach covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct minimum cost for each test case.
