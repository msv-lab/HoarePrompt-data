Postcondition: `tree` is a defaultdict where each key is a node (an integer from 1 to n) and the corresponding value is a list containing all the nodes it is connected to through the edges specified in the `edges` list; `leaves` is a list containing all the nodes which have only one connection through; `dist1` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[0]` using BFS; `dist2` is the distance from `start` to `leaves[1]` using BFS; **both `dist1` and `dist2` are odd numbers**.
