The only variable in the loop head is the `queue`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, the loop will continue as long as `queue` is non-empty. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0). For the loop to execute the first time, `queue` must contain at least one element.

Since the initial state of `queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), this means that `queue` already contains at least one element, which is the tuple (`start`, 0). Therefore, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0)**
