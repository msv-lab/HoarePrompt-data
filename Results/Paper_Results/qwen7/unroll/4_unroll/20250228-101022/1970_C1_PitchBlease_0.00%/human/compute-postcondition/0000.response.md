Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, and `tree` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where the keys are node indices and the values are lists of neighboring nodes.**

The code initializes a queue with a single element, which is a tuple containing the starting node (`start`) and a distance of 0. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
