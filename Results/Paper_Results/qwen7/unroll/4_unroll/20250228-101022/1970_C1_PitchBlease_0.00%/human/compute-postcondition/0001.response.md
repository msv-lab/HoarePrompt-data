Output State: **`queue` is a deque containing the tuple (`start`, 0), `start` is an integer representing the starting node where the stone is initially placed, `target` is an integer representing one of the leaves of the tree, `tree` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree where the keys are node indices and the values are lists of neighboring nodes, `visited` is a set containing the element `start`.**

In this step, the code initializes a set called `visited` and adds the starting node (`start`) to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
