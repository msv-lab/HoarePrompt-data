### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be made into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of removals needed to break this property. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of identical numbers (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers found (`minn`).
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` as necessary.
   - After processing the array, it checks if `minn` is still `inf` or equals the length of the array, indicating it was never possible to break the beauty condition, and prints `-1` in such cases. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic for tracking sequences of identical numbers seems correct.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in the implementation. The variable `num` is updated incorrectly within the loop. Specifically, `num` should be updated only when a new segment of different numbers starts, but the current implementation updates `num` inside the `else` block, which means `num` is always set to the next element in the array, regardless of whether it matches the previous segment or not.
   - This incorrect update of `num` leads to incorrect values for `same` and `minn`, especially in cases where the array has multiple segments of the same number.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code correctly describes the state transitions and the overall logic, but it does not highlight the critical error in the implementation of `num`.
   - The state transitions and the final output state are correctly described, but the internal logic for calculating `same` and `minn` is flawed due to the incorrect update of `num`.

### Conclusion:
The given code does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The critical flaw in the implementation of `num` leads to incorrect results for many test cases.

**Correctness: False**

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
