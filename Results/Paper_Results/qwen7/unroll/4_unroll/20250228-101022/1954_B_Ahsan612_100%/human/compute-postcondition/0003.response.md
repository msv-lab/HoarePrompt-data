Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it accepts an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5), and a list `a` of `n` integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n). The function determines if the array `a` is beautiful for each test case and returns a result based on the beauty condition.**

Note: The actual logic for determining if the array is beautiful is not described here, only the parameters and expected behavior in terms of what the function is supposed to accept and return.
