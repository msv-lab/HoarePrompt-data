Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. After executing the loop, minn is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array a, or -1 if no such segment exists. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
