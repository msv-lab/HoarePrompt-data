Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. Specifically, the logic for determining the minimum number of elements to remove is flawed. The program attempts to find the smallest segment of consecutive identical elements and uses this to determine the minimum number of removals needed. However, this approach does not always yield the correct result.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 1 2 1
```

The program will output `1`, suggesting that removing one element is sufficient to make the array non-beautiful. However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the third element (which is `1`) will result in the array `[1, 2, 2, 1]`. This array is not beautiful because the middle two elements (`2` and `2`) do not satisfy the condition for the array to be beautiful.

The program fails to handle cases where multiple segments of identical elements exist and needs to find the optimal way to remove elements to break the beauty condition. The current implementation only considers the smallest segment of identical elements, which may not be the optimal solution in all cases.
