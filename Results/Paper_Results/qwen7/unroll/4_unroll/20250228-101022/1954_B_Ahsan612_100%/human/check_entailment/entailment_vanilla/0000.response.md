### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing an element \(a_i\) with \(a_{i-1}\) where \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The array is initially beautiful, meaning there are sequences of repeated elements where the condition \(a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}\) holds.
   - To break the beauty of the array, we need to remove enough elements such that no such sequence exists anymore.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func` reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence length (`same`), the number to which the sequence is currently aligned (`num`), and the minimum sequence length found (`minn`).
   - It iterates through the array, updating the sequence length and tracking the minimum sequence length.
   - After processing the array, it checks if the minimum sequence length is infinite (`inf`) or equal to the length of the array (`len(ar)`). If so, it prints `-1` indicating it's impossible to break the beauty. Otherwise, it prints the minimum sequence length.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic for identifying the minimum sequence length is correct. It correctly identifies the longest sequence of consecutive elements that could potentially be reduced to a single value.
   - However, the program does not account for the actual removal of elements to break the beauty. Instead, it just finds the minimum sequence length, which is not sufficient to determine the minimum number of elements to remove.
   - The program should identify the longest sequence and calculate the number of elements needed to break this sequence, rather than just finding the minimum sequence length.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It only finds the minimum sequence length but does not compute the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty of the array.

**Correctness: False**
