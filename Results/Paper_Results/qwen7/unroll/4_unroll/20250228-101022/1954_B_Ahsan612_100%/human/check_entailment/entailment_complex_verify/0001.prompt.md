You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Let's call an array a beautiful if you can make all its elements the same by
using the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero):

  * choose an index i (2 \le i \le |a| - 1 ) such that a_{i - 1} = a_{i + 1} , and replace a_i with a_{i - 1} . 

You are given a beautiful array a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n . What is the minimum
number of elements you have to remove from it in order for it to stop being
beautiful? Swapping elements is prohibited. If it is impossible to do so, then
output -1.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ).

Additional constraints on the input:

  * in every test case, the given array a is beautiful; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of elements
you have to remove from the array a in order for it to stop being beautiful.
If it is impossible, then output -1.

Example

Input

    4
    
    3
    
    2 2 2
    
    5
    
    1 2 1 2 1
    
    1
    
    1
    
    7
    
    3 3 3 5 3 3 3

Output

    -1
    1
    -1
    3
    
Note

In the first testcase, it is impossible to modify the array in such a way that
it stops being beautiful. An array consisting of identical numbers will remain
beautiful no matter how many numbers we remove from it.

In the second testcase, you can remove the number at the index 5 , for
example.

The resulting array will be [1, 2, 1, 2] . Let's check if it is beautiful. Two
operations are available:

  * Choose i = 2 : the array becomes [1, 1, 1, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it, and the numbers are not all the same. 
  * Choose i = 3 instead: the array becomes [1, 2, 2, 2] . No more operations can be applied to it either, and the numbers are still not all the same. 

Thus, the array [1, 2, 1, 2] is not beautiful.

In the fourth testcase, you can remove the first three elements, for example.
The resulting array [5, 3, 3, 3] is not beautiful.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and the array a is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and the given array a is beautiful. After executing the loop, minn is an integer representing the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array a, or -1 if no such segment exists. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `n`, followed by a list `ar` of `n` integers. It then finds the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same value in the array `ar`. If such segments exist, it prints the minimum length; otherwise, it prints -1.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if it can be made into an array with all identical elements by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The operation involves choosing an index `i` (where `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) such that `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}` and replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}`.
   - The goal is to find the minimum number of removals needed to break this property. If it's impossible, return `-1`.

3. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each one individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It initializes variables to track the current sequence of identical numbers (`same`), the number currently being tracked (`num`), and the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers found (`minn`).
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `same` and `minn` as necessary.
   - After processing the array, it checks if `minn` is still `inf` or equals the length of the array, indicating it was never possible to break the beauty condition, and prints `-1` in such cases. Otherwise, it prints `minn`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic for tracking sequences of identical numbers seems correct.
   - The approach of finding the minimum length of any sequence of identical numbers is sound, as removing fewer than this length would still leave the array beautiful.
   - The handling of edge cases (like when `minn` remains `inf` or equals the length of the array) is appropriate.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the solution to the problem as described. It accurately identifies the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful or returns `-1` if it's impossible.
