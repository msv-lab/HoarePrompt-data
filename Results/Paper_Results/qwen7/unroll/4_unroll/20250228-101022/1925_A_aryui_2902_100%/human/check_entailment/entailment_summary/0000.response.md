Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program's function `func_1` generates a string consisting of the first `k` characters of the alphabet, repeated `n` times. However, this approach does not ensure that all possible strings of length `n` that can be formed using the first `k` lowercase English alphabets occur as a subsequence of the generated string. The provided execution summary also indicates that the function does not take any parameters, which is incorrect according to the problem statement.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to construct a string that contains all possible subsequences of length `n` using the first `k` characters. The provided examples show that the solution requires a more complex construction than simply repeating the first `k` characters `n` times.

Correctness: **False**
