You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Three friends gathered to play a few games of chess together.

In every game, two of them play against each other. The winner gets 2 points
while the loser gets 0 , and in case of a draw, both players get 1 point each.
Note that the same pair of players could have played any non-negative number
of times (possibly zero). It is also possible that no games were played at
all.

You've been told that their scores after all the games were played were p_1 ,
p_2 and p_3 . Additionally, it is guaranteed that p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 holds.

Find the maximum number of draws that could have happened and print it. If
there isn't any way to obtain p_1 , p_2 and p_3 as a result of a non-negative
number of games between the three players, print -1 instead.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 500 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers p_1 , p_2 and p_3 (0
\leq p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3 \leq 30 ) — the scores of the three players, sorted
non-decreasingly.

Output

For each testcase, print one number — the maximum possible number of draws
that could've happened, or -1 if the scores aren't consistent with any valid
set of games and results.

Example

Input

    7
    
    0 0 0
    
    0 1 1
    
    1 1 1
    
    1 1 2
    
    3 3 3
    
    3 4 5
    
    1 1 10

Output

    0
    1
    -1
    2
    -1
    6
    2
    
Note

In the first example, no games were played at all, so no draws could occur
either.

For the second example, exactly one game occurred between the second and the
third player and it ended in draw, so the answer is 1 .

It's easy to see that there's no set of games achieving the scores in third
example, so the answer for it is -1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (p1, p2, p3) = map(int, input().split())
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:
                    print(p1 - x + p3)
                    break
                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and for each test case, p_1, p_2, and p_3 are integers satisfying 0 ≤ p_1 ≤ p_2 ≤ p_3 ≤ 30.

    t = int(input())

        p1, p2, p3 = map(int, input().split())
        
        if (p1 + p2 + p3) % 2 != 0:
            print(-1)
            continue
        
        if p3 >= p1 + p2:
            print(p1 + p2)
        else:
            x = 0
            y = p3
            while y >= x:
                if p1 - x <= p2 - y:

                else:
                    x += 1
                    y -= 1
            else:
                print(p3)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` will be printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p1 + p2` will be printed. Otherwise, a value calculated from `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be printed through a specific algorithm involving a while loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Score Validation**: 
   - The program checks if the sum of the scores (`p1 + p2 + p3`) is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even (since each game contributes either 2 points to the winners or 2 points in total if it's a draw).
   - This check is necessary because the sum of the scores must be even for the scores to be achievable.
3. **Score Consistency Check**:
   - The program then checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to `p1 + p2`. If this condition is true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is the maximum possible number of draws. This is because if `p3` is at least as large as the sum of the other two scores, it means all games could have been draws.
4. **Detailed Calculation**:
   - If the above conditions fail, the program enters a loop where it tries to find the maximum number of draws by adjusting the values of `x` and `y` (representing the differences from `p1` and `p2` to `p3`).
   - The loop ensures that the difference between `p1 - x` and `p2 - y` does not exceed the possible scores given the constraints.
   - If a valid combination is found, it prints the number of draws as `p1 - x + p3`.

### Analysis:
- The logic correctly identifies when the scores are inconsistent (when the sum is odd or `p3` is less than `p1 + p2`).
- The detailed calculation within the loop aims to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are consistent.
- The approach handles all given examples correctly.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of draws or return `-1` if the scores are inconsistent.

### Correctness:
**True**
