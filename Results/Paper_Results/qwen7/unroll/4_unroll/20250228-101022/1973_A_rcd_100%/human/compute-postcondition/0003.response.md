Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed based on the conditions within the loop. For each iteration, if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is odd, `-1` will be printed. If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, then `p1 + p2` will be printed. Otherwise, a value calculated from `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` will be printed through a specific algorithm involving a while loop.
