Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.

2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If not, it prints `-1` because the total score must be even since each game contributes either 2 points (to the winner) or 2 points distributed (in case of a draw).

3. **Condition for No Draws**: If `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program directly prints `p1 + p2`. This condition ensures that the highest score (`p3`) can be achieved without any draws, which is a necessary condition for the scores to be consistent.

4. **Draw Calculation**: In the else block, the program attempts to calculate the maximum number of draws. It uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws that could have happened. However, this part of the logic seems flawed. The logic inside the while loop does not accurately calculate the maximum number of draws. Specifically, the conditions `if p1 - x <= p2 - y:` and the increment/decrement of `x` and `y` do not correctly reflect the scoring rules of the game.

5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated number of draws or `-1` based on the conditions checked.

Given the above analysis, the logic for calculating the maximum number of draws is incorrect. Therefore, the program does not always produce the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
