Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by reading the scores `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`.
2. **Sum Check**: The program checks if the sum of `p1`, `p2`, and `p3` is even. If the sum is odd, it correctly prints `-1`, which is the right approach since an odd sum cannot be achieved with the given scoring rules.
3. **Score Validation**: The program checks if `p3` is greater than or equal to the sum of `p1` and `p2`. If true, it prints `p1 + p2`, which is a valid scenario.
4. **Draw Calculation**: For cases where `p3` is less than the sum of `p1` and `p2`, the program uses a while loop to find the maximum number of draws. The logic inside the loop seems to adjust the values of `x` and `y` to maximize the number of draws while ensuring the scores are achievable. The formula `p1 - x + p3` is used to calculate the maximum possible number of draws, which appears to be correct based on the problem statement.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to handle all edge cases correctly and produce the expected outputs as per the examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
