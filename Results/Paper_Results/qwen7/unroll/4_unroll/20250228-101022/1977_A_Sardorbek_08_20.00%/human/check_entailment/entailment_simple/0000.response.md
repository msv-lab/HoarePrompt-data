### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `a` and processes each test case individually. This part is correct.

2. **Test Case Processing**:
   - For each test case, the program reads two integers `b` and `c`, representing the number of moves and the desired number of cubes, respectively.
   - The program checks several conditions to determine if it's possible to end up with `c` cubes after `b` moves:
     - If `b == c`, it prints "YES". This condition is correct because if the number of moves equals the desired number of cubes, it means Nikita can simply add one cube per move to achieve the desired result.
     - If `b < c`, it prints "NO". This condition is correct because it's impossible to have more cubes than moves allow when each move can only add or remove one cube.
     - The condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:` is incorrect. This condition should not be used here because `a` is the number of test cases, not the number of moves `b`. The parity of `b` (number of moves) should be checked instead of `a`.
     - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "No". This part is correct but redundant since the previous conditions cover all possibilities.

3. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs "YES" or "NO" without quotes, which is acceptable according to the problem statement. However, the use of "Yes" and "No" (with lowercase) in the code is inconsistent with the required format ("YES", "NO", "Yes", "No"). This inconsistency might lead to incorrect outputs, but the logic itself is correct.

### Conclusion:
The core logic of the program is correct, but there is an error in the condition `if a % 2 == b % 2:` which should be `if b % 2 == 0:` or `if b % 2 == 1:` depending on the intended logic. Additionally, the output format should be consistent with the required format.

Given these points, the program is mostly correct but needs minor adjustments.

### Correctness:
**False**
