Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `a` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then enters a loop to process each test case.

2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `b` and `c` using `map(int, input().split())`.
   - It stores these values in a tuple `q = (b, c)`.

3. **Checking Conditions:**
   - The program checks if `b` (number of moves) is equal to `c` (desired number of cubes).
     - If `b == c`, it prints 'YES'.
   - If `b` is less than `c`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to end up with more cubes than moves allow.
   - If `b` is greater than `c`, it further checks if `b % 2 == c % 2`.
     - If this condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Case 1: `b == c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is exactly equal to the desired number of cubes (`c`), Nikita can simply add one cube per move, ending up with `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'YES'.

2. **Case 2: `b < c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is less than the desired number of cubes (`c`), it's impossible to end up with more cubes than the number of moves. This is correctly handled by printing 'NO'.

3. **Case 3: `b > c`:**
   - If the number of moves (`b`) is greater than the desired number of cubes (`c`), we need to check if the parity (odd/even nature) of the number of moves matches the parity of the desired number of cubes.
     - If `b % 2 == c % 2`, it means the number of additions and removals can balance out to result in `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'Yes'.
     - If `b % 2 != c % 2`, it means the parity does not match, making it impossible to end up with `c` cubes. This is correctly handled by printing 'No'.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
