Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `a` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `a = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `a`. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was part of the initial state and was not affected by the code execution.
