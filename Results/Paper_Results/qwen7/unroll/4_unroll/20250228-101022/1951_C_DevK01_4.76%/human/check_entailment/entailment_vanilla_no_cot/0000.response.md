To determine if the provided solution is correct, let's analyze the logic and the approach taken in the function `func`.

### Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and the array `M` which represents the ticket prices for each day.

2. **Sorting Prices:**
   - The prices are sorted in ascending order, which helps in minimizing the cost when buying tickets. This is a good optimization step.

3. **Calculating Minimum Cost:**
   - The code calculates the number of days required to buy `k` tickets (`q = int(math.ceil(k / m))`).
   - It then selects the first `q` elements from the sorted list `M` and calculates the cost.
   - If the total number of tickets bought using the selected days equals `k`, it calculates the cost directly.
   - Otherwise, it adjusts the cost calculation by considering the additional tickets bought beyond the full days.

4. **Cost Calculation:**
   - The cost is calculated based on the sum of the ticket prices for the selected days and the additional cost due to the increase in price for subsequent days.

### Correctness Check

Let's verify the correctness of the logic through the provided examples:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  4 2 3
  8 6 4 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  10
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The optimal way to buy 3 tickets is:
    - Day 3: Buy 1 ticket for 4.
    - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets for 6.
  - Total cost = 4 + 6 + 6 - 4 (since the price on day 4 increases by 1 after buying 2 tickets on day 4) = 10.

#### Example 2:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  4 2 8
  8 6 4 2
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  64
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The optimal way to buy 8 tickets is:
    - Day 1: Buy 2 tickets for 16.
    - Day 2: Buy 2 tickets for 16.
    - Day 3: Buy 2 tickets for 16.
    - Day 4: Buy 2 tickets for 16.
  - Total cost = 16 + 16 + 16 + 16 = 64.

#### Example 3:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  5 100 1
  10000 1 100 10 1000
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The optimal way to buy 1 ticket is:
    - Day 1: Buy 1 ticket for 10000.
  - Total cost = 10000.

#### Example 4:
- **Input:**
  ```
  4
  6 3 9
  5 5 5 5 5 5
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  72
  ```

- **Explanation:**
  - The optimal way to buy 9 tickets is:
    - Day 1: Buy 3 tickets for 15.
    - Day 2: Buy 3 tickets for 15.
    - Day 3: Buy 3 tickets for 15.
  - Total cost = 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 = 90 - 18 (since the price increases by 3 after buying 3 tickets on each day) = 72.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the examples and the logic, the provided solution seems to correctly calculate the minimum cost to buy `k` tickets under the given constraints. Therefore, the provided program is correct.

**Correctness: True**
