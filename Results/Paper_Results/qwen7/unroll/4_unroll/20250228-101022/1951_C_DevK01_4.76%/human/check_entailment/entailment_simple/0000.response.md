Reasoning:
1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list of ticket prices `M`.
2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list of ticket prices `M`, which is necessary to minimize the cost by buying tickets at the lowest possible prices first.
3. **Calculation of Cost**:
   - The program calculates the number of days (`q`) required to buy `k` tickets by dividing `k` by `m` and rounding up.
   - It then extracts the relevant portion of the sorted list `M` into `N` and calculates the cost based on the number of tickets that can be bought in full days (`n * m`) and any remaining tickets.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the total number of tickets that can be bought in full days equals `k`, it calculates the cost directly.
   - Otherwise, it handles the remaining tickets separately and adds the cost accordingly.
5. **Output**: The program prints the calculated cost for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, it appears to correctly calculate the minimum cost to purchase `k` tickets under the given conditions.

Correctness: **True**
