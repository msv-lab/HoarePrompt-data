You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 10^9, and 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n⋅m, 10^9); a is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for all i in range n.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        L = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        M = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        n, m, k = L[0], L[1], L[2]
        
        m = min(m, k)
        
        M.sort()
        
        q = int(math.ceil(k / m))
        
        N = M[:q]
        
        n = len(N)
        
        if n * m == k:
            cost = m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * n // 2)
        else:
            w = N.pop()
            mu = k - (n - 1) * m
            cost = mu * w
            n = len(N)
            cost += m * sum(N) + m * m * ((n - 1) * (n - 2) // 2) + n * m * mu
        
        print(cost)
        
        continue
        
    #State: Output State: The final value of `t` will be the same as the initial value of `t`. For each iteration of the loop, the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` will be updated based on the input lists `L` and `M`. The variable `cost` will be calculated differently depending on the values of `n` and `m`, and printed at the end of each iteration. After all iterations, the final state of `t`, along with all the `cost` values printed during each iteration, will be the output state.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, m, k, and a. For each test case, it checks if t is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and if n, m, and k are integers within their specified ranges. It also verifies that a is a list of n integers, each between 1 and 10^9. The function then returns a result based on the processed test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
