Output State: **`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state.**

This means that `t` now holds the integer value entered by the user, constrained between 1 and 10^4, while `n`, `m`, `k`, and the list `a` retain their original values from the initial state.
