Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a value based on predefined conditions involving an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100) and two integers `x` and `y` (where 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 9).**

This means the function does not directly accept any parameters but seems to use some internal or external values for `t`, `x`, and `y` to determine its output. However, based on the given format, we can only describe the parameters it indirectly uses and the nature of the output.
