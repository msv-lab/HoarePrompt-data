Reasoning:

1. The problem statement specifies that there will be `t` test cases, and each test case involves two integers `x` and `y`.
2. The annotated program incorrectly initializes `x` and `y` as lists with 10 elements each, even though the number of test cases `t` can vary between 1 and 100. This means the program will always try to process exactly 10 pairs of numbers, regardless of the actual number of test cases.
3. The program reads `t` (the number of test cases) correctly, but it then proceeds to read `t` pairs of numbers, which is fine. However, the subsequent loop runs 10 times regardless of `t`, which is incorrect.
4. To fix this, the loop should run `t` times instead of a fixed 10 times.

Given these points, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the varying number of test cases.

Correctness: **False**
