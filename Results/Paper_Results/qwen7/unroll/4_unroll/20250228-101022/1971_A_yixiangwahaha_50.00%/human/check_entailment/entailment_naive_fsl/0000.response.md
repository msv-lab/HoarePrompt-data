Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the input format specified in the problem description. The problem states that the first line contains the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` lines each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. However, the program reads `t` from the first line but then attempts to read 10 pairs of integers regardless of the value of `t`. This will lead to incorrect behavior for inputs where `t` is not equal to 10.

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 9
8 4
1 4
3 4
2 0
```
The program will incorrectly process 10 pairs of integers instead of just 5, leading to wrong outputs for the additional 5 pairs that do not exist in the input.
