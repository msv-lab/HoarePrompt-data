Output State: **`t` is an input integer within the range 1 to 100; `x` is an empty list; `y` is an empty list.**

The code initializes `y` as an empty list, which does not affect the values of `t` or `x`. Therefore, the output state retains the initial conditions for `t` and `x`, while adding that `y` is also an empty list.
