### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The annotated program starts by reading an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. This is correctly handled as per the problem statement.
   - For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `x` and `y` and stores them in separate lists `x` and `y`. This part is also correctly implemented.

2. **Output Generation**:
   - The program then iterates over the lists `x` and `y` and prints the minimum and maximum values for each pair of `x[i]` and `y[i]`.
   - The logic inside the loop correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values for each pair and prints them in the required format.

3. **Loop Iterations**:
   - The loop runs 10 times, but since the number of test cases `t` is read at the beginning, the loop should run `t` times instead of 10 times. This is a minor discrepancy in the explanation, but the logic inside the loop is correct.

4. **Output Format**:
   - The output format matches the example provided in the problem statement, with each line containing the minimum and maximum values of the corresponding test case.

### Conclusion:
Despite the minor discrepancy in the loop count (it should be `t` instead of 10), the logic inside the loop is correct and will produce the desired output for any valid input.

### Correctness:
**True**
