You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Alice and Bob gathered in the evening to play an exciting game on a sequence
of n integers, each integer of the sequence doesn't exceed 4 . The rules of
the game are too complex to describe, so let's just describe the winning
condition — Alice wins if the [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
all the numbers in the sequence is non-zero; otherwise, Bob wins.

The guys invited Eve to act as a judge. Initially, Alice and Bob play with n
numbers. After one game, Eve removes one of the numbers from the sequence,
then Alice and Bob play with n-1 numbers. Eve removes one number again, after
which Alice and Bob play with n - 2 numbers. This continues until the sequence
of numbers is empty.

Eve seems to think that in such a game, Alice almost always wins, so she wants
Bob to win as many times as possible. Determine the maximum number of times
Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains four integers p_i (0 \le
p_i \le 200 ) — the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence at
the beginning of the game.

Output

For each test case, print the maximum number of times Bob will win in a
separate line, if Eve removes the numbers optimally.

Example

Input

    5
    
    1 1 1 0
    
    1 0 1 2
    
    2 2 2 0
    
    3 3 2 0
    
    0 9 9 9

Output

    1
    1
    3
    3
    12
    
Note

In the first example, Bob wins when Eve has not removed any numbers yet.

In the second example, Bob wins if Eve removes one one and one three.

- Program:
import math

def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt = 0
        if a[0] % 2 == a[1] % 2 == a[2] % 2 == 1:
            cnt += 1
        for x in a:
            cnt += math.floor(x / 2)
        print(cnt)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. For each test case, it increments a counter by 1 if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, and then adds half of each count to the counter. Finally, it prints the computed counter value for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem involves determining the maximum number of times Bob can win based on the initial counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in the sequence.
   - Alice wins if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, otherwise Bob wins.
   - Eve removes numbers optimally to maximize Bob's wins.

2. **Analyzing the Given Program:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - For each test case, it reads the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s into a list `a`.
   - It initializes a counter `cnt` to 0.
   - The program checks if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd. If they are, it increments `cnt` by 1.
   - Then, it iterates through the list `a` and adds the floor division of each element by 2 to `cnt`.

3. **Correctness Analysis:**
   - The logic for checking if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd is incorrect. This condition does not directly relate to the optimal strategy for maximizing Bob's wins.
   - The addition of `math.floor(x / 2)` for each element in the list `a` is also incorrect. This operation does not contribute to the correct solution.

4. **Correct Solution:**
   - To solve this problem correctly, we need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.
   - The key insight is that Bob wins if the total count of 1s, 2s, and 3s is even, because removing one of these numbers (which are odd) will make the count odd, allowing Alice to win.
   - Therefore, the maximum number of times Bob can win is equal to the minimum of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s.

### Corrected Program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        # Calculate the minimum of the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s
        cnt = min(a[0], a[1], a[2])
        print(cnt)

func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect because it does not follow the correct logic to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win. Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**
