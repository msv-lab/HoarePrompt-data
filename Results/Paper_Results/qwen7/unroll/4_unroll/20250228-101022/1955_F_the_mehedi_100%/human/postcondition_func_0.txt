The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s. For each test case, it increments a counter by 1 if the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, and then adds half of each count to the counter. Finally, it prints the computed counter value for each test case.
