Functionality: The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of four non-negative integers representing the counts of 1s, 2s, 3s, and 4s in an initial sequence. For each test case, it calculates a value `cnt` by incrementing it by 1 for each set of counts (p_i, q_i, r_i) where the counts of 1s, 2s, and 3s are all odd, and then adding half of each count in the list. Finally, it prints the calculated value `cnt` for each test case.
