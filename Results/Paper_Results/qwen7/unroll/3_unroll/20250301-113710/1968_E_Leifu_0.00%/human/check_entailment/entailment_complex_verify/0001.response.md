### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the value of \( n \).
   - It always prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), which will always be part of the solution.
   - If \( n \) is 3, it additionally prints \((2, 3)\). This is a valid configuration for \( n=3 \) as it maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For \( n > 3 \), it prints \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 4)\), and then for each subsequent row from 4 to \( n \), it prints \((j, j)\).

3. **Verification**:
   - For \( n=2 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\), resulting in Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n=3 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and \((2, 3)\), resulting in Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\). This is correct.
   - For \( n=4 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((4, 4)\), \((3, 3)\), \((5, 5)\), etc., which results in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. However, this configuration does not necessarily maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For example, placing \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 4)\) might not be optimal for maximizing the set of distinct distances.
   - For \( n=5 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), etc., which is a valid configuration but may not be optimal.
   - For \( n=6 \): The solution prints \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), \((1, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), and then \((4, 4)\), \((5, 5)\), \((6, 6)\), etc., which is also a valid configuration but may not be optimal.

Upon closer inspection, the provided solution does not always maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances. Specifically, for \( n > 3 \), the placement of \((1, 4)\) and \((2, 4)\) might not be the best choice to maximize the set of distinct distances. A better approach would be to distribute the points more evenly across the grid to ensure a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment is inaccurate because the provided solution does not guarantee the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances for all \( n \). Therefore, the final evaluation should be:

**Final: False**
