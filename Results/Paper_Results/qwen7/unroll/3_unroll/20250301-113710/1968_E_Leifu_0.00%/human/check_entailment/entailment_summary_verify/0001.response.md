Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to place `n` cells in an `n x n` grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Provided Solution**:
   - The function starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.
   - It always prints the coordinates `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which will always be part of the solution.
   - If `n` is 3, it additionally prints `(2, 3)`. This is a valid configuration for `n=3` as it maximizes the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For `n > 3`, it prints `(1, 4)` and `(2, 4)`, and then for each subsequent row from 4 to `n`, it prints `(j, j)`.

3. **Verification**:
   - For `n=2`: The solution prints `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, resulting in Manhattan distances `{0, 1}`. This is correct.
   - For `n=3`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`, resulting in Manhattan distances `{0, 1, 2, 3}`. This is correct.
   - For `n=4`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, but it should print `(3, 4)` instead of `(4, 4)` and `(3, 3)` to ensure the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances. The current solution only prints up to `(2, 4)` and then prints `(4, 4)` repeatedly, which does not maximize the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
   - For `n=5`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, but similar to `n=4`, it should print `(3, 4)` and `(4, 5)` to ensure the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances. The current solution does not cover all possible distinct distances.
   - For `n=6`: The solution prints `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 4)`, and then `(4, 4)`, `(5, 5)`, `(6, 6)`, but again, it should print `(3, 4)`, `(4, 5)`, and `(5, 6)` to ensure the maximum set of distinct Manhattan distances. The current solution does not cover all possible distinct distances.

Given the analysis, the provided solution does not correctly maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for all tested values of `n`. Specifically, for `n > 3`, the solution does not ensure that all possible distinct Manhattan distances are covered.

Final: **False**
