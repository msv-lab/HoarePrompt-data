### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step using the provided annotations and the problem description.

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.

2. **Output Generation:**
   - The program always starts by printing the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`.
   - If `n == 3`, it prints the additional point `(2, 3)`.
   - For other values of `n`, it prints the additional point `(2, 4)` followed by pairs of integers from `4` to `n` each paired with themselves.

Now let's evaluate the correctness of the program against the examples provided in the problem statement:

- **For \( n = 2 \):**
  - The program prints:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    ```
  - The Manhattan distances are:
    - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
    - \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \)
    - \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \)
  - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1\}\).
  - This is correct as it achieves the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

- **For \( n = 3 \):**
  - The program prints:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    2 3
    ```
  - The Manhattan distances are:
    - \( |1-1| + |1-1| = 0 \)
    - \( |1-1| + |2-2| = 0 \)
    - \( |1-1| + |3-3| = 0 \)
    - \( |1-2| + |1-1| = 1 \)
    - \( |1-2| + |2-3| = 2 \)
    - \( |1-2| + |3-3| = 1 \)
    - \( |2-1| + |1-1| = 1 \)
    - \( |2-1| + |2-2| = 1 \)
    - \( |2-1| + |3-3| = 1 \)
    - \( |2-2| + |1-1| = 1 \)
    - \( |2-2| + |2-2| = 0 \)
    - \( |2-2| + |3-3| = 0 \)
    - \( |3-1| + |1-1| = 2 \)
    - \( |3-1| + |2-2| = 2 \)
    - \( |3-1| + |3-3| = 2 \)
  - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2\}\).
  - This is incorrect because the optimal set should include distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) as shown in the example.

- **For \( n = 4 \):**
  - The program prints:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    2 4
    4 4
    4 4
    5 5
    6 6
    ...
    ```
  - The Manhattan distances include:
    - Distances involving points \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) are already covered.
    - Additional distances are generated by points \((2, 4)\) and \((4, 4)\).
  - The set of distinct Manhattan distances is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\).
  - This is incorrect because the optimal set should include distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\) as shown in the example.

From the above analysis, we can see that the program does not generate the optimal set of points for \( n = 3 \) and \( n = 4 \). Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) in all cases.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
