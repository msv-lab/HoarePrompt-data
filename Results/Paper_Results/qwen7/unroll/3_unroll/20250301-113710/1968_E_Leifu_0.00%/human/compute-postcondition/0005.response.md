Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer \( t \) (1 to 50) and an integer \( n \) (2 to 10^3). For each test case, it prints specific pairs of integers starting with '1 1' and '1 2'. If \( n \) equals 3, it prints '2 3'; otherwise, it prints '2 4' followed by pairs of integers from 4 to \( n \), each pair being the integer with itself (e.g., '4 4', '5 5'). The function does not return any value.**
