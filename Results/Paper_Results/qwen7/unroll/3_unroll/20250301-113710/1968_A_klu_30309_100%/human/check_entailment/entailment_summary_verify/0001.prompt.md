You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
test_cases = [int(input()) for _ in range(t)]
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for x in test_cases:
        max_sum = 0
        best_y = 1
        for y in range(x - 1, 0, -1):
            gcd_val = math.gcd(x, y)
            current_sum = gcd_val + y
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                best_y = y
                break
        results.append(best_y)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `test_cases`, a list of positive integers between 2 and 1000. For each `x` in `test_cases`, it finds the best `y` value that maximizes the sum of the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` plus `y`. It then returns a list named 'results' containing these best `y` values for each `x` in `test_cases`.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and the values for each test case `x`.

2. **Function Call**: The program calls the function `func_1` with the appropriate arguments and stores the results in a list.

3. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates over each test case.
   - For each test case `x`, it initializes `max_sum` to 0 and `best_y` to 1.
   - It then iterates over all possible values of `y` from `x-1` down to 1.
   - For each `y`, it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using `math.gcd`.
   - It computes the sum `gcd_val + y`.
   - If this sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `best_y` to the current value of `y`, then breaks out of the loop to avoid unnecessary checks.

4. **Output**: The function appends the `best_y` to the results list and returns it.

5. **Output Printing**: The program prints each result from the `results` list.

### Analysis:

- The logic in the function `func_1` is correct. It correctly identifies the value of `y` that maximizes the sum `gcd(x, y) + y`.
- The loop structure ensures that the first `y` that gives the maximum sum is chosen, and the loop stops early once this value is found.
- The constraints (1 ≤ y < x) are properly handled.
- The use of `math.gcd` is appropriate for calculating the greatest common divisor.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
