Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the decoding logic. The function `func_1` is designed to map each character in the `encoded` string back to a unique character in the alphabet, but it does not actually decode the string as intended. Instead of constructing the original string `s`, the function creates a list of all lowercase Latin letters from 'a' to 'z' in order and returns them as a string. This is not the correct approach for decoding the string.

To correctly decode the string, we need to follow these steps:
1. Construct the auxiliary string `r` which consists of all distinct characters of the `encoded` string in alphabetical order.
2. Create a mapping from each character in `r` to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.
3. Decode the `encoded` string using this mapping.

Let's correct the function to properly decode the string:

```python
def func_1(encoded):
    # Step 1: Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded)))
    
    # Step 2: Create a mapping from each character in r to its symmetric counterpart
    mapping = {r[i]: r[-(i+1)] for i in range(len(r))}
    
    # Step 3: Decode the encoded string using the mapping
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

With this corrected function, the program should correctly decode the encoded strings.

Correctness: **False**
