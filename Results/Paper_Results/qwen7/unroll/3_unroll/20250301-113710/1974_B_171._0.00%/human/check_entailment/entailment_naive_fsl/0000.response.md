Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the program generates a mapping for each character in the encoded string without considering the reverse symmetry required for decoding. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the encoded string `encoded = "serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, and the decoding process should replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding symmetric character from `r`.

However, the current implementation of `func_1` does not generate the correct mapping. It simply appends characters to the `decoded` list without ensuring that the mapping is symmetric. For instance, in the given example, the character `'s'` in the encoded string should map to `'c'` in the decoded string, but the program incorrectly maps it to `'f'`.

To fix this, the program needs to construct the auxiliary string `r` and then create a symmetric mapping. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the program:

```python
import sys
from typing import List

input = sys.stdin.readline

if __name__ == '__main__':
    num_cases = int(input().strip())
    for _ in range(num_cases):
        n = int(input().strip())
        encoded = input().strip()
        decoded = func_1(encoded)
        print(decoded)

def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Create the auxiliary string r
    r = ''.join(sorted(set(encoded), key=encoded.index))
    
    # Create the symmetric mapping
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
```

This corrected version ensures that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed correctly and that the symmetric mapping is properly established, thus correctly decoding the encoded string.
