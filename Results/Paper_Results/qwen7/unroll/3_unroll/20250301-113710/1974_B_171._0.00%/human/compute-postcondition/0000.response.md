Output State: **`encoded` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and its length n satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `mapping` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `mapping`. This dictionary will be used later to store the mapping between characters in the original string and the encoded string, but currently, it is empty. All other variables and their conditions remain unchanged from the initial state.
