### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the lexicographically smallest 3-letter word that can be encoded to a given integer `n`.
   - The encoding is the sum of the positions of the letters in the alphabet.
   - The word must consist of exactly 3 lowercase Latin letters.

2. **Analyzing the Provided Code:**
   - The code reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the encoded integer `lex`.
   - It then tries to construct the word by appending letters to the list `arr` based on certain conditions:
     - If `lex` is less than or equal to 26, it appends 'a' (position 1).
     - If `lex` is between 27 and 51, it appends 'z' (position 26).
     - Otherwise, it appends 'z' again.
   - After constructing the list `arr`, it sorts it and prints the corresponding letters.

3. **Issues with the Code:**
   - The logic for constructing the word is flawed. It does not correctly handle the encoding process.
   - The code does not ensure that the constructed word is the lexicographically smallest possible word for the given encoded value.
   - The sorting step is unnecessary and incorrect since it does not reflect the actual encoding process.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To find the lexicographically smallest word, we should start from the smallest possible letters and adjust the remaining value accordingly.
   - We should subtract the largest possible values first to minimize the letters used.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotated code suggests that the code constructs the word by repeatedly appending 'a' or 'z' based on the value of `lex`. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not account for the correct distribution of the encoded value across the three letters.
   - The sorted list `arr` is then printed, which is not relevant to the encoding process.

6. **Correct Solution:**
   - The correct solution involves starting with the smallest possible letters ('a') and adjusting the remaining value by subtracting the largest possible values (26) until the value is exhausted.
   - The corrected code provided in the original assessment is more accurate and ensures that the lexicographically smallest word is constructed.

### Conclusion:
The provided code is incorrect because it does not correctly construct the lexicographically smallest word for the given encoded value. The original assessment was accurate in identifying the issues and providing a corrected solution.

**Final: False**
