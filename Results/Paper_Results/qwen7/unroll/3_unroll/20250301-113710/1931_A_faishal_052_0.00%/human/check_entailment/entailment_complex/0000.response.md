Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Handling of `lex`**: The program incorrectly processes `lex` in the inner loop. It attempts to break down `lex` into parts, but this approach is flawed. The program should consider all possible combinations of three letters to find the smallest one that sums up to `lex`.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Letters**: The program always appends `arr.append(lex)` at the end of the loop, which means it is not correctly calculating the individual letters. Instead, it should calculate each letter based on the remaining value of `lex` after subtracting the contributions of the previous letters.

3. **Sorting and Reversing**: The program sorts the array `arr` and then prints the characters, which is unnecessary and incorrect for finding the lexicographically smallest word.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should:
- Iterate over all possible combinations of three letters (from 'aaa' to 'zzz').
- Check if the sum of the positions of these letters equals the given `n`.
- Return the lexicographically smallest combination that matches the sum.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    cases = int(input())
    for _ in range(cases):
        n = int(input())
        min_word = 'zzz'
        for i in range(1, 27):
            for j in range(1, 27):
                for k in range(1, 27):
                    if i + j + k == n:
                        current_word = chr(i + 96) + chr(j + 96) + chr(k + 96)
                        if current_word < min_word:
                            min_word = current_word
        print(min_word)

# Example usage
func()
```

Given this analysis, the original program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
