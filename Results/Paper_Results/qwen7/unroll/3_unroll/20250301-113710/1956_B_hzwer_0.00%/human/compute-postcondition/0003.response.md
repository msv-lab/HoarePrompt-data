Output State: **`dp[n - 1][0]` is set to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list `cards` contains integers from the input split by spaces, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), where each element is initialized to 0.**

The code sets the value of `dp[n - 1][0]` to 0. All other variables and their initial conditions remain unchanged.
