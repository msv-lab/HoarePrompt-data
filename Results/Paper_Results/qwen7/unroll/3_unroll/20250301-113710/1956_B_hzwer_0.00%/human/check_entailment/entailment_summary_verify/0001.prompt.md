You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You and Nene are playing a card game. The deck with 2n cards is used to play
this game. Each card has an integer from 1 to n on it, and each of integers 1
through n appears exactly on 2 cards. Additionally, there is a table where
cards are placed during the game (initially, the table is empty).

In the beginning of the game, these 2n cards are distributed between you and
Nene so that each player receives n cards.

After it, you and Nene alternatively take 2n turns, i.e. each person takes n
turns, starting with you. On each turn:

  * The player whose turn is it selects one of the cards in his hand. Let x be the number on it. 
  * The player whose turn is it receives 1 point if there is already a card with the integer x on the table (otherwise, he receives no points). After it, he places the selected card with the integer x on the table. 

Note that turns are made publicly: each player can see all the cards on the
table at each moment.

Nene is very smart so she always selects cards optimally in order to maximize
her score in the end of the game (after 2n rounds). If she has several optimal
moves, she selects the move that minimizes your score in the end of the game.

More formally, Nene always takes turns optimally in order to maximize her
score in the end of the game in the first place and to minimize your score in
the end of the game in the second place.

Assuming that the cards are already distributed and cards in your hand have
integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n written on them, what is the maximum number of
points you can get by taking your turns optimally?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ). The description of test cases follows.

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of cards you and Nene receive in the beginning of the game.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le n ) —
the integers on the cards in your hand. It is guaranteed that each integer
from 1 through n appears in the sequence a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n at most 2
times.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer: the maximum number of points you can
get.

Note

In the first test case, the integers written on your cards are 1 , 1 , 2 and 3
. The integers written on Nene's cards are 2 , 3 , 4 and 4 . The game may
proceed as follows:

  1. You select one of the cards with an integer 1 written on it and place it on the table. 
  2. Nene selects one of the cards with an integer 4 written on it and places it on the table. 
  3. You select the card with an integer 1 written on it, receive 1 point, and place the selected card on the table. 
  4. Nene selects the card with an integer 4 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  5. You select the card with an integer 2 written on it and place it on the table. 
  6. Nene selects the card with an integer 2 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 
  7. You select the card with an integer 3 written on it and place it on the table. 
  8. Nene selects the card with an integer 3 written on it, receive 1 point, and places the selected card on the table. 

At the end of the game, you scored 1 point, and Nene scored 3 . It can be
shown that you cannot score more than 1 point if Nene plays optimally, so the
answer is 1 .

In the second test case, if both players play optimally, you score 2 points
and Nene scores 6 points.

- Program:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    cards = list(map(int, input().split()))
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[n - 1][0] = 0
    dp[n - 2][0] = 0
    for i in range(n - 3, -1, -1):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if cards.count(j + 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j]
            elif cards.count(j + 1) == 1:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1)
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i + 2][j - 1] + 1, dp[i + 1][j + 1])
    return dp[0][0]



- Function Summary: 
The function calculates and returns the maximum value obtained by a given logic involving dynamic programming. This logic iterates over a list of integers, considering specific constraints on the values of `t` and `n`. The function does not accept any parameters directly but uses input values for `n` and a list of integers `cards`. It constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` to find the maximum value based on the count of each integer in the list and updates this table in reverse order. The final result, stored in `dp[0][0]`, represents the maximum value achievable under the given conditions.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a two-player card game where each player receives `n` cards out of a total of `2n` cards. The goal is to maximize the number of points a player can score by optimally choosing which card to play on their turn. Nene, the opponent, always plays optimally to maximize her score and minimize the player's score.

2. **Analyzing the Given Code**:
   - The code uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to solve the problem.
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score the current player can achieve with `i` remaining cards in their hand and `j` points already scored.
   - The loop iterates backward through the number of remaining cards and the number of points scored.
   - For each state, the code checks the count of each card in the player's hand and updates the `dp` table accordingly.

3. **Checking the Logic**:
   - **Base Cases**: The base cases `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` are correctly initialized to 0.
   - **Transition Logic**:
     - If a card `j+1` is not present in the player's hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 0`), the player cannot score any points with this card, so the value is carried forward from the next state.
     - If a card `j+1` is present once in the player's hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 1`), the player can either choose to play this card and score 1 point or skip it and carry forward the points.
     - If a card `j+1` is present twice in the player's hand (`cards.count(j + 1) == 2`), the player has three choices: play one card and score 1 point, play both cards and score 2 points, or skip both cards and carry forward the points.

4. **Correctness of the Solution**:
   - The logic correctly handles all possible scenarios for each card in the player's hand.
   - The dynamic programming approach ensures that the solution considers all possible moves and their outcomes.
   - The code correctly returns the maximum score the player can achieve by the end of the game.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem.
