Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally against an opponent who also plays optimally.
2. The provided solution uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum points you can get starting from the `i`-th card in your hand, assuming you have `j` points already.
3. The solution iterates backward through the cards and updates the DP table based on whether the current card (`j + 1`) is present in your hand. The logic handles three cases:
   - If the card is not in your hand, you can't earn any points.
   - If the card is present once, you can either use it now or save it for later.
   - If the card is present twice, you have more options to consider.
4. The final answer is stored in `dp[0][0]`, which represents the maximum points you can get starting from the first card with 0 points.
5. The provided code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach and handles all edge cases as described in the problem statement.

Given the analysis, the provided solution seems to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
