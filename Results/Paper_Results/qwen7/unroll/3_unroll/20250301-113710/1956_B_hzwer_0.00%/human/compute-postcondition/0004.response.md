Output State: **`dp[n - 1][0]` is set to 0, `dp[n - 2][0]` is set to 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, and the list `cards` contains integers from the input split by spaces, representing the integers on the cards in your hand, where each integer from 1 through n appears at most twice.**

In this step, the code sets `dp[n - 2][0]` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
