You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000; for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50; p is a list of n integers where each p_i is an integer such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if (n == 2) :
        print(2)
        #This is printed: 2
    else :
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
            
        #State: The value printed is either 2 or nothing, depending on whether the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`. If the condition is met for at least one `i`, then 2 is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.
        print(3)
        #This is printed: 3
    #State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n` is 2, `p` is a list of 2 integers where each `p_i` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ 2, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct; `v` is a list of length 3 where each element is an integer read from input and the first element is 0. If `n` is 2, then `t` remains unchanged. If `n` is not 2, the value printed is either 2 or nothing, depending on whether the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`. If the condition is met for at least one `i`, then 2 is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a predefined set of inputs (t, n, p) where t is an integer between 1 and 5000, n is an integer between 2 and 50, and p is a list of n integers. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for t, n, and p.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
