You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

- Program:
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    func_1()

def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    v = [0] * (n + 1)
    v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    if n == 2:
        print(2)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if v[v[v[i]]] == i:
                print(2)
                return
        print(3)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes predefined inputs \( t \), \( n \), and \( p \) where \( t \) is an integer between 1 and 5000, \( n \) is an integer between 2 and 50, and \( p \) is a list of \( n \) integers. It initializes a list \( v \) based on the input and checks if a specific condition is met. Depending on the outcome, it prints either 2 or 3 and returns nothing. If \( n \) is 2, it always prints 2. Otherwise, it iterates through the list \( v \) and checks if \( v[v[v[i]]] == i \) for any \( i \) in the range 1 to \( n \). If the condition is met for any \( i \), it prints 2; otherwise, it prints 3.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `t = int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using `for i in range(t):`.

2. **Defining `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the number of friends `n` using `n = int(input())`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it to include the best friend indices using `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **Handling Small Case:**
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints `2` immediately, which is correct because both friends need to be invited to ensure both come to the party.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, which is correct because inviting both friends in this pair ensures both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`. This logic is not entirely correct. According to the problem statement, we need to find the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party. Inviting 3 friends might not always be the minimum.

### Example Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples provided:

- **Example 1:** `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - If we invite friends `[4, 5]`, both come to the party. This is correct and the minimum number of invitations is `2`.
  - However, the program incorrectly prints `3` because it does not check for the pair `[4, 5]`.

- **Example 2:** `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - If we invite friends `[1, 2, 3]`, friends `[1, 2]` come to the party. This is correct and the minimum number of invitations is `3`.
  - The program correctly prints `3`.

- **Example 3:** `p = [2, 1]`
  - If we invite friends `[1, 2]`, both come to the party. This is correct and the minimum number of invitations is `2`.
  - The program incorrectly prints `2` because it does not check for the pair `[1, 2]`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and thus does not always provide the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the program should be modified to correctly handle all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
