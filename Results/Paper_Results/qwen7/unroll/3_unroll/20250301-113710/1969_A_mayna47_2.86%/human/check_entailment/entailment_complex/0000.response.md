Reasoning:
- The annotated program correctly handles the input format and constraints as specified in the problem statement.
- For \( n = 2 \), the program correctly prints 2, which is the minimum number of invitations needed because both friends are best friends with each other.
- For \( n > 2 \), the program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are best friends with each other and also have their best friends invited. If such a pair exists, it prints 2, which is the minimum number of invitations required. This is because inviting both members of this pair ensures that at least 2 friends come to the party.
- If no such pair exists, the program prints 3, which is the next minimum number of invitations required. This is because inviting any single friend would not ensure that at least 2 friends come to the party, but inviting three friends might be necessary to meet the requirement.

Given the logic and the examples provided, the program appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
