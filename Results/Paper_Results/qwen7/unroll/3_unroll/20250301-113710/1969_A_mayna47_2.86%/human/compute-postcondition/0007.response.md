Output State: `v` is a list of length `n + 1` with the first element being 0, and the rest of the elements are integers read from input. The value printed is either 2 or nothing, depending on whether the condition `v[v[v[i]]] == i` is met for any `i` in the range 1 to `n`. If the condition is met for any `i`, then 2 is printed; otherwise, nothing is printed.
