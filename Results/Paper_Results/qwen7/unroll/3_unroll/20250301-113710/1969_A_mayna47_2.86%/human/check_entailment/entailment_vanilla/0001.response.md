Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Test Cases:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` using `t = int(input())`.
   - It then iterates over each test case using `for i in range(t):`.

2. **Defining `func_1`:**
   - The function `func_1` is defined to handle each test case.
   - Inside `func_1`, it reads the number of friends `n` using `n = int(input())`.
   - It initializes a list `v` with zeros and updates it to include the best friend indices using `v = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))`.

3. **Handling Small Case:**
   - If `n == 2`, the program prints `2` immediately, which is correct because both friends need to be invited to ensure both come to the party.

4. **Main Logic:**
   - The program checks if there exists a pair of friends who are each other's best friends (`v[v[v[i]]] == i`). If such a pair is found, it prints `2` and returns, which is correct because inviting both friends in this pair ensures both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, the program prints `3`. This logic is not entirely correct. According to the problem statement, we need to find the minimum number of invitations such that at least 2 friends come to the party. Inviting 3 friends might not always be the minimum.

### Example Analysis

Let's re-examine the examples provided:

- **Example 1:** `p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
  - If we invite friends `[4, 5]`, both come to the party. This is correct and the minimum number of invitations is `2`.
  - However, the program incorrectly prints `3` because it does not check for the pair `[4, 5]`.

- **Example 2:** `p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
  - If we invite friends `[1, 2, 3]`, friends `[1, 2]` come to the party. This is correct and the minimum number of invitations is `3`.
  - The program correctly prints `3`.

- **Example 3:** `p = [2, 1]`
  - If we invite friends `[1, 2]`, both come to the party. This is correct and the minimum number of invitations is `2`.
  - The program incorrectly prints `2` because it does not check for the pair `[1, 2]`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly identify pairs of friends who are each other's best friends and thus does not always provide the minimum number of invitations needed. Therefore, the program should be modified to correctly handle all cases.

### Correctness: **False**
