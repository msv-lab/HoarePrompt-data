Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads three integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.

2. **Conditions for Winning:**
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of `k` and `x` to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of having an unlimited number of coins.

3. **Case 1: \( x < k - 1 \):**
   - If `x` (maximum number of consecutive losses) is less than `k - 1` (number of times the bet is increased in case of a win minus one), the program checks if `a` (initial number of coins) is greater than or equal to `x + 1`.
   - If `a >= x + 1`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - This condition is correct because if Sasha can afford to lose up to `x` times in a row, and he starts with enough coins to cover these losses plus one additional bet, he can always recover and continue betting.

4. **Case 2: \( x = k - 1 \):**
   - If `x` equals `k - 1`, the program checks if `a` is greater than or equal to `x + 3`.
   - If `a >= x + 3`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - This condition is correct because if Sasha can afford to lose `k - 1` times in a row, and he starts with enough coins to cover these losses plus two additional bets, he can always recover and continue betting.

5. **Case 3: \( x > k - 1 \):**
   - If `x` is greater than `k - 1`, the program calculates a value `z` which represents the minimum number of coins required to ensure Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row.
   - It uses a loop to calculate `z` as the sum of `z // (k - 1) + 1` for `x + 1` iterations.
   - If `a` is greater than or equal to `z`, it prints 'YES'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
   - This condition is correct because it ensures that Sasha can recover from losing `x` times in a row, given the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve his goal of having an unlimited number of coins based on the given conditions. The calculations and comparisons are accurate and align with the problem statement.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
