Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the logic for determining whether Sasha can achieve any number of coins is flawed. Let's consider the following test case:

**Test Case:**
- \( k = 2 \)
- \( x = 1 \)
- \( a = 1 \)

According to the problem description, Sasha can only place a bet of 1 coin initially. If he loses, he cannot place any more bets because he would not have enough coins to place a valid bet (which must be a positive integer and cannot exceed his current number of coins). Therefore, Sasha cannot guarantee having any number of coins greater than 1, which contradicts the output of the program.

The program incorrectly prints "YES" for this case, as it does not account for the fact that Sasha cannot place a bet after losing, making it impossible to accumulate more coins. Thus, the program is incorrect.
