Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
2. It handles the different cases based on the values of \( k \) and \( x \):
   - If \( x < k - 1 \), it checks if \( a \geq x + 1 \).
   - If \( x = k - 1 \), it checks if \( a \geq x + 3 \).
   - If \( x > k - 1 \), it calculates a threshold value \( z \) using the formula \( z = 0 \) and iteratively updates it until it reaches a value that ensures \( a \geq z \).
3. The logic for calculating \( z \) ensures that Sasha can always achieve a sufficient number of coins to win any number of coins, as long as the conditions are met.
4. The program correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions specified in the problem.

Given the detailed analysis, the annotated program accurately reflects the problem requirements and correctly determines the output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
