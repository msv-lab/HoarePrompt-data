Output State: The output state depends on the inputs provided during each iteration of the loop. For each iteration, the values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are used to determine whether the output will be 'YES' or 'NO'. The value of `t` specifies the number of iterations. After all iterations, the final output will consist of 'YES' or 'NO' printed for each iteration, based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
