Reasoning:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling**: The code correctly reads the number of test cases and iterates through each test case. It also correctly handles the input for `na_frente` (number of people in front of Kirill) and `pos_final` (maximum allowable final position).

2. **Cost Arrays**: The code correctly initializes the arrays `custo_pra_trocar_a` and `custo_pra_passar_b` from the input.

3. **Loop Logic**: 
   - The loop iterates backward from `na_frente` to 0, which is appropriate for calculating the minimum cost.
   - The logic for updating `best` and `total` is correct. It checks whether it's cheaper to swap positions with the current person or to pass through them, and updates the total cost accordingly.
   - The condition `if v <= pos_final:` ensures that only relevant positions are considered for swapping, which aligns with the problem statement.

4. **Output**: The code prints the minimum cost for each test case, which is the expected output format.

Given the above analysis, the provided code appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**
