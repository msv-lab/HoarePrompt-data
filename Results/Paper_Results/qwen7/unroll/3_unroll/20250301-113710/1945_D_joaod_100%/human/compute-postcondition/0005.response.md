Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each case, it calculates the minimum cost required to move from position `na_frente` to position `pos_final`. It considers two options for moving: either by changing the value at the current position (with a cost from the `custo_pra_trocar_a` list) or by passing to the next position (with a cost from the `custo_pra_passar_b` list). The function outputs the minimum cost for each test case.**
