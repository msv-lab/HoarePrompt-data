Functionality: **The function processes a series of queries on an input array `nums`. It first identifies segments within the array where consecutive elements are identical, storing the start and end indices of these segments along with the value. Then, for each query defined by a pair of indices `(l, r)`, it determines whether the interval `[l, r)` falls entirely within any of the identified segments. If so, it prints the start and end indices of the segment; otherwise, it prints `-1, -1`. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.**
