Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer with an additional element `-1` appended, `s` is an integer representing the start index of segments, `e` is an integer representing the end index of segments, `num` is the last element of the list `nums` before the loop ends, `arr` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains three elements: the start index (`1 + s`), the end index (`i`), and the segment value (`num`).
