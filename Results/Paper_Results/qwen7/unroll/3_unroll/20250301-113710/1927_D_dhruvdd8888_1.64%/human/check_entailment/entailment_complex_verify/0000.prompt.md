You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of n integers, and q queries.

Each query is represented by two integers l and r (1 \le l \le r \le n ). Your
task is to find, for each query, two indices i and j (or determine that they
do not exist) such that:

  * l \le i \le r ; 
  * l \le j \le r ; 
  * a_i \ne a_j . 

In other words, for each query, you need to find a pair of different elements
among a_l, a_{l+1}, \dots, a_r , or report that such a pair does not exist.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the elements of the array a .

The third line of each test case contains a single integer q (1 \le q \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of queries.

The next q lines contain two integers each, l and r (1 \le l < r \le n ) — the
boundaries of the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of the
values of q across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each query, output two integers separated by space: i and j (l \le i, j
\le r ), for which a_i \ne a_j . If such a pair does not exist, output i=-1
and j=-1 .

You may separate the outputs for the test cases with empty lines. This is not
a mandatory requirement.

    #State: The output state will depend on the inputs provided during the execution of the loop. The loop processes pairs of integers (l, r) and prints intervals based on the conditions specified within the loop body. Specifically, it uses binary search to find relevant segments in the `arr` list and prints intervals or -1 based on the comparison between the segment boundaries and the input values l and r. Since the exact inputs (l, r) are not given, the output cannot be precisely determined but will consist of pairs of integers or -1 for each input pair processed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of queries on an input array `nums`. It first identifies segments within the array where consecutive elements are identical, storing the start and end indices of these segments along with the value. Then, for each query defined by a pair of indices `(l, r)`, it determines whether the interval `[l, r)` falls entirely within any of the identified segments. If so, it prints the start and end indices of the segment; otherwise, it prints `-1, -1`. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each query.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to consider the case where the subarray from `l` to `r` contains only one unique element. In such cases, the program incorrectly prints `-1 -1` instead of indicating that no such pair exists.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input:
```
5
3
1 1 1
1
1 3
```

The program will output:
```
-1 -1
```

However, according to the problem description, since there is no pair of different elements within the subarray `[1, 1, 1]`, the correct output should be `-1 -1`. But the program does not handle this edge case properly.

Additionally, the program uses `bisect_left` to find the relevant segment in the `arr` list, but it does not ensure that the segment boundaries are within the query range `[l, r]`. This could lead to incorrect results if the segment boundaries are outside the query range.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the segment boundaries are within the query range and handle the case where the subarray contains only one unique element.
