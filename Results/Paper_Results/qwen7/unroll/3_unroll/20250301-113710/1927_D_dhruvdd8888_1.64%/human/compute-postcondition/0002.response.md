Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `nums` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `nums = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input from `sys.stdin.readline`, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in the list `nums`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q` remain unchanged.
