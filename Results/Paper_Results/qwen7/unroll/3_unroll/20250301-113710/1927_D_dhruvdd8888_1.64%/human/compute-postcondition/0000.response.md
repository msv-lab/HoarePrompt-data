Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element a_i is an integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^6, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, and `input` is set to `sys.stdin.readline`**.

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply assigns the function `sys.stdin.readline` to the variable `input`. This does not change the values of any variables or the conditions they satisfy. It only updates which function is referenced by the variable `input`.
