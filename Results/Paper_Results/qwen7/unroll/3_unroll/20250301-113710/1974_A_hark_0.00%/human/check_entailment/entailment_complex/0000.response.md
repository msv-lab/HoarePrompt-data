Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly returns the smaller value between `a` and `b`. However, this function is not directly used in the main logic of the program. Therefore, we can consider it as a utility function and focus on `func_2()` and `func_3()` for the correctness check.

2. **Function `func_2()`**: This function is crucial for calculating the minimum number of screens needed. Let's break down its logic:
   - If both `x` and `y` are greater than 0, it calculates the number of 2x2 icons needed (`bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)`), updates `x` by subtracting the equivalent number of 1x1 icons that would fit into the 2x2 icons (`x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`), and then calculates the remaining 1x1 icons needed (`bxsfory1 = math.ceil(x / 15) + 1`).
   - If only `y` is greater than 0, it directly calculates the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
   - If only `x` is greater than 0, it calculates the number of screens needed for 1x1 icons (`math.ceil(x / 15)`).
   - If both `x` and `y` are 0, it prints `0`.

3. **Function `func_3()`**: This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_2()`. The logic here is correct and ensures that each test case is processed independently.

Given the problem statement and the provided examples, the logic in `func_2()` appears to correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for the given number of 1x1 and 2x2 icons. The function handles all edge cases appropriately, and the overall structure of the program is sound.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
