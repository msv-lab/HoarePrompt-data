You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and for each test case, x and y are integers such that 0 ≤ x, y ≤ 99.
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, and it has been used to control the number of iterations in the loop. After the loop executes all the iterations, no other variables are affected by the loop, so their states remain unchanged. The loop itself does not change any variable's value; it only calls `func_2()` for `t` times.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It processes a test case where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For each test case, x and y are integers between 0 and 99 inclusive. The function does not return any specific value but seems to process these test cases based on given constraints.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
