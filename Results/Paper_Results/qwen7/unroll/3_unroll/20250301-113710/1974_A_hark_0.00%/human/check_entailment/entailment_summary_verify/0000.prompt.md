You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Little Rosie has a phone with a desktop (or launcher, as it is also called).
The desktop can consist of several screens. Each screen is represented as a
grid of size 5 \times 3 , i.e., five rows and three columns.

There are x applications with an icon size of 1 \times 1 cells; such an icon
occupies only one cell of the screen. There are also y applications with an
icon size of 2 \times 2 cells; such an icon occupies a square of 4 cells on
the screen. Each cell of each screen can be occupied by no more than one icon.

Rosie wants to place the application icons on the minimum number of screens.
Help her find the minimum number of screens needed.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0
\leq x, y \leq 99 ) — the number of applications with a 1 \times 1 icon and
the number of applications with a 2 \times 2 icon, respectively.

Output

For each test case, output the minimal number of required screens on a
separate line.

Blue squares represent empty spaces for icons, green squares represent 1
\times 1 icons, red squares represent 2 \times 2 icons

The solution for the third test case can look as follows:

- Program:
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a < b else b

#Function 2:
def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if x > 0 and y > 0:
        bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)
        x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4
        bxsfory1 = 0 if x <= 0 else math.ceil(x / 15) + 1
        print(bxsfory1 + bxsfory)
    elif x == 0 and y > 0:
        print(math.ceil(y / 2))
    elif x > 0 and y == 0:
        print(math.ceil(x / 15))
    else:
        print(0)

#Function 3:
def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 3 : The function processes a series of test cases defined by an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4). For each test case, it calls another function `func_2()`. After processing all test cases, the function does not return any specific value and leaves the original variables (x and y) unchanged.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of screens needed for placing the icons. Specifically, the logic in `func_2` is flawed. Let's analyze the issue:

1. **Incorrect Calculation for Mixed Icons**: The formula used to calculate the number of screens is incorrect. For instance, when there are both 1x1 and 2x2 icons, the current logic does not properly account for the space taken by 2x2 icons. 

   - The formula `bxsfory = math.ceil(y / 2)` calculates the number of 2x2 icons that can fit into the available space.
   - However, the subsequent calculation `x = x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4` is incorrect because it incorrectly adjusts the remaining space for 1x1 icons and does not ensure the minimum number of screens is used.

2. **Example Case Analysis**:
   - Consider the input `7 2`. According to the problem, we need to place 7 one-cell icons and 2 four-cell icons. The correct solution would be to use 2 screens: one screen for the 2 four-cell icons and another for the remaining 3 one-cell icons.
   - However, the current implementation might not correctly handle this scenario, leading to an incorrect number of screens.

Here is a corrected approach:
- Calculate the number of screens needed for 2x2 icons (`math.ceil(y / 2)`).
- Calculate the remaining space after placing the 2x2 icons.
- Determine how many additional screens are needed for the remaining 1x1 icons.

The corrected function could look like this:

```python
import math

def func_2():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    screens_for_2x2 = math.ceil(y / 2)
    remaining_space = 15 * screens_for_2x2 - 4 * y
    screens_for_1x1 = math.ceil(x / 15)
    if remaining_space >= x:
        total_screens = screens_for_2x2 + max(0, screens_for_1x1 - screens_for_2x2)
    else:
        total_screens = math.ceil((x + 4 * y) / 15)
    print(total_screens)

def func_3():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_2()
```

This corrected version ensures that the minimum number of screens is calculated accurately for any combination of 1x1 and 2x2 icons.
