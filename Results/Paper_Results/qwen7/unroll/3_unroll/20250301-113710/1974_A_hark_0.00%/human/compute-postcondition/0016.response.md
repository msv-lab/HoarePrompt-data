Postcondition: **`bxsfory1` and `bxsfory` are calculated based on the values of `x` and `y`. If `x > 0` and `y > 0`, then `bxsfory1` is `math.ceil(x / 15) + 1` if `x > 0` else 0, `bxsfory` is `math.ceil(y / 2)`, and `x` is updated to `x - bxsfory * 15 + y * 4`. If `x` is 0, then `y` represents the number of 2 × 2 icons (and `y > 0`). Otherwise, `x` and `y` represent the number of 1 × 1 and 2 × 2 icons, respectively, with at least one of them being non-zero.**
