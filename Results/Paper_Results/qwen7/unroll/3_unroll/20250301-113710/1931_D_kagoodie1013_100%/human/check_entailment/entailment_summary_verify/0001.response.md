### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input and processes them one by one.
   - It extracts the necessary parameters (`n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`) for each test case.

2. **Main Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
   - For each element in the array, it computes the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the occurrences of each unique pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - If a pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)` is found again, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Correctness of Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` ensures that `r_x` is non-negative and less than `x`. This is because `-num % x` effectively computes the remainder when `num` is subtracted from the next multiple of `x` that is greater than or equal to `num`.
   - The calculation of `r_y = num % y` is straightforward and correct.

4. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**:
   - The function correctly counts the number of beautiful pairs by checking if the pair `(r_x, r_y)` has been seen before in the `residue_map`.
   - Each time a new pair is encountered, its count is incremented in the `residue_map`.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case as required.

Given the above points, the program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The original assessment is accurate.
