Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions. It uses a residue map to efficiently count pairs that satisfy both conditions: \(a_i + a_j\) is divisible by \(x\) and \(a_i - a_j\) is divisible by \(y\). The program iterates through the array once and uses a dictionary to keep track of the residues, ensuring that the solution is efficient and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to meet the requirements.
