Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `test_cases`, which is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). For each tuple in `test_cases`, the function calculates the sum of counts of residue pairs (r_x, r_y) for the list of integers `arr`. The result is a list of integers called 'results', where each integer represents the total count of such residue pairs for each list in `test_cases`.**
