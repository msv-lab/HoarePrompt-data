Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n); `results` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variable `test_cases` remains unchanged from its initial state, which is a list of tuples containing three integers (n, x, y) followed by a list of n integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_n). The output state reflects these conditions.
