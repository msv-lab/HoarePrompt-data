Output State: `results` is a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of counts of occurrences of pairs of residues `(r_x, r_y)` for each list of integers `arr` in `test_cases`. Specifically, for each tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` in `test_cases`, the loop calculates how many times each pair of residues `(r_x, r_y)` appears, where `r_x = -num % x` and `r_y = num % y`, and then sums these counts to append to the `results` list.
