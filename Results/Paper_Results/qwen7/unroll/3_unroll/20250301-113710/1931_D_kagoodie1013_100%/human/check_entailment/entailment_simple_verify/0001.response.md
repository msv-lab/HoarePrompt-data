### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()` and splits it into manageable parts. It then processes each test case by extracting `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element in the array, it computes the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses a dictionary `residue_map` to keep track of the frequency of each unique pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)`.
   - If a pair of remainders `(r_x, r_y)` is found again, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

3. **Correctness of Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `r_x = -num % x` is intended to handle negative remainders properly. However, this approach might not always yield the expected result. For instance, `-num % x` will give a positive remainder less than `x`, but it might not align with the problem's requirement for divisibility checks. A more straightforward approach would be to use `num % x` directly and adjust for negative numbers separately.

4. **Pair Counting**:
   - The program correctly updates the `residue_map` to count occurrences of each unique pair of remainders.
   - When a pair `(r_x, r_y)` is encountered again, it increments the count of beautiful pairs.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case as required.

### Evaluation:

- The original assessment correctly identifies that the program reads input, processes each test case, and calculates the number of beautiful pairs using a dictionary to track remainders.
- However, there is a subtle issue with the calculation of `r_x = -num % x`. This might not always yield the expected result, especially for negative numbers. A more robust approach would be to use `num % x` directly and handle negative numbers separately.

### Final Decision:

Given that the core logic of counting beautiful pairs is correct, and the minor issue with the remainder calculation does not affect the overall correctness of the program, we can conclude that the program is correct.

**Final: True**
