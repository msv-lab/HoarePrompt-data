You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two distinct non-negative integers x and y . Consider two
infinite sequences a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots and b_1, b_2, b_3, \ldots , where

  * a_n = n \oplus x ; 
  * b_n = n \oplus y . 

Here, x \oplus y denotes the [bitwise
XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation of
integers x and y .

For example, with x = 6 , the first 8 elements of sequence a will look as
follows: [7, 4, 5, 2, 3, 0, 1, 14, \ldots] . Note that the indices of elements
start with 1 .

Your task is to find the length of the longest common subsegment^\dagger of
sequences a and b . In other words, find the maximum integer m such that a_i =
b_j, a_{i + 1} = b_{j + 1}, \ldots, a_{i + m - 1} = b_{j + m - 1} for some i,
j \ge 1 .

^\dagger A subsegment of sequence p is a sequence p_l,p_{l+1},\ldots,p_r ,
where 1 \le l \le r .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers x and y (0 \le x, y \le
10^9, x \neq y ) — the parameters of the sequences.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the length of the longest common
subsegment.

Example

Input

    4
    
    0 1
    
    12 4
    
    57 37
    
    316560849 14570961

Output

    1
    8
    4
    33554432
    
Note

In the first test case, the first 7 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,\ldots]

b = [0, 3, 2, 5, 4, 7, 6,\ldots]

It can be shown that there isn't a positive integer k such that the sequence
[k, k + 1] occurs in b as a subsegment. So the answer is 1 .

In the third test case, the first 20 elements of sequences a and b are as
follows:

a = [56, 59, 58, 61, 60, 63, 62, 49, 48, 51, 50, 53, 52, 55, 54, \textbf{41,
40, 43, 42}, 45, \ldots]

b = [36, 39, 38, 33, 32, 35, 34, 45, 44, 47, 46, \textbf{41, 40, 43, 42}, 53,
52, 55, 54, 49, \ldots]

It can be shown that one of the longest common subsegments is the subsegment
[41, 40, 43, 42] with a length of 4 .

    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed for each test case within the loop. For each test case, the value of `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) will determine the output:
    #
    #- If `k` is a power of 2, it will print `k`.
    #- If `k` is odd, it will print `1`.
    #- If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it will find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, subtract that power of 2 from `k`, and continue this process until `k` becomes a power of 2 or 1, then print the final value of `k`.
    #
    #Each line of output corresponds to the result of one test case.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length of the longest common subsegment between two sequences \(a\) and \(b\), where \(a_n = n \oplus x\) and \(b_n = n \oplus y\).
   - The key observation is that the length of the longest common subsegment depends on the binary representation of the difference \(k = |x - y|\).

2. **Key Insight:**
   - If \(k\) is a power of 2 (i.e., \(k = 2^m\)), then the longest common subsegment has a length of \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is not a power of 2 but is odd, the longest common subsegment has a length of 1.
   - For other cases, we need to find the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\).

3. **Program Analysis:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases and processes each pair of \(x\) and \(y\).
   - It calculates \(k = |x - y|\).
   - It checks if \(k\) is a power of 2 using the condition `k & k - 1 == 0`.
   - If \(k\) is a power of 2, it prints \(k\).
   - If \(k\) is odd, it prints 1.
   - For other cases, it finds the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\) and prints that value.

4. **Correctness Verification:**
   - The logic for checking if \(k\) is a power of 2 is correct.
   - The logic for handling odd \(k\) values is correct.
   - The process of finding the highest power of 2 that divides \(k\) is also correct.

Given the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem.
