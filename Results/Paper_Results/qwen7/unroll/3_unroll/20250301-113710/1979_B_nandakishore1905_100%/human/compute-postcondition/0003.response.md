Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) and two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 10^9). For each test case, it returns either a specific value or an error message based on the relationship between `x` and `y`.**

Given the constraints and the implied nature of the function, it seems the function processes multiple test cases, each containing `t`, `x`, and `y`. The function evaluates the relationship between `x` and `y` and returns a result or an error message accordingly. However, without the exact logic inside the function, we can only infer that it processes these parameters and returns a value or an error message for each test case.
