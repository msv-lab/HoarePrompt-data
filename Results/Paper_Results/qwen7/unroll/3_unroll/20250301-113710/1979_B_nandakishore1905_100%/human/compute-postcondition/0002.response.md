Output State: The output state will consist of a series of numbers printed for each test case within the loop. For each test case, the value of `k` (which is the absolute difference between `n` and `m`) will determine the output:

- If `k` is a power of 2, it will print `k`.
- If `k` is odd, it will print `1`.
- If `k` is even and not a power of 2, it will find the highest power of 2 less than or equal to `k`, subtract that power of 2 from `k`, and continue this process until `k` becomes a power of 2 or 1, then print the final value of `k`.

Each line of output corresponds to the result of one test case.
