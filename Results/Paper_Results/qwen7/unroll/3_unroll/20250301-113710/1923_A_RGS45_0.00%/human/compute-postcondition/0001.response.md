State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop uses `range(t)` to determine how many times it should iterate.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0.
3. The initial state of `t` being an input integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) ensures that `t` is within this range, but it does not guarantee that the loop will execute if `t` is 0.
4. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is that `t` must be greater than 0.
