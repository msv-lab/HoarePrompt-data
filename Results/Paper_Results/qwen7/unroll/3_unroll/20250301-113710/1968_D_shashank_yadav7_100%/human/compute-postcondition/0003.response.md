Output State: t is an input integer indicating the number of test cases. For each test case, the following variables are updated after the loop execution:

- n, k, b, s are integers representing the length of lists p and a, a starting index, and another starting index respectively.
- p and a are lists of integers.
- After the loop, bm and sm are updated based on the maximum values calculated during the iterations.
- The loop prints 'Bodya' if bm is greater than sm, 'Sasha' if bm is less than sm, and 'Draw' if bm equals sm.
