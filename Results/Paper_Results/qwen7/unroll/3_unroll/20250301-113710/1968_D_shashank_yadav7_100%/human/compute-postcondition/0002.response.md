Output State: t is an input integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the following variables are defined:
- n, k, b, s are integers.
- p is a list of integers.
- a is a list of integers.
After executing the loop, the program prints either 'Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw' based on the comparison between bm and sm. The values of b, s, p, and a are updated according to the rules within the loop, but their final states are not specified without knowing the input values.
