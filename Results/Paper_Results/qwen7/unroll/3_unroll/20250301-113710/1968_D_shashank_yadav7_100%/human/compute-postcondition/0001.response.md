State: **`t` is an input integer, `i` must be 0, `t` must be greater than 0** 

Explanation:
- The loop variable `i` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to start its first iteration.
- The value of `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once. If `t` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.
