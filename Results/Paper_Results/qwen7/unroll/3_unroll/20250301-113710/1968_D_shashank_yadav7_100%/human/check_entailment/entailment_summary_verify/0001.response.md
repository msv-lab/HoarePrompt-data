### Reasoning

Let's re-evaluate the provided program against the problem description and the function summary to ensure its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap
- The goal is to determine the winner of a game played by Bodya and Sasha.
- Both players start at specific positions in a permutation and take turns moving and scoring based on the values in an array.
- The game consists of `k` turns, and the player with the highest score after `k` turns wins.

#### Function Summary Recap
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- It calculates the maximum possible scores for both players and compares them to determine the winner.

#### Detailed Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b` (Bodya's starting position), and `s` (Sasha's starting position).
   - It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Adjusting Starting Positions:**
   - The starting positions `b` and `s` are adjusted by subtracting 1 because the indices start from 0 in Python.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation:**
   - The initial scores `sp` (Sasha's score) and `bp` (Bodya's score) are set to the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
   - The maximum possible scores `sm` (Sasha's maximum score) and `bm` (Bodya's maximum score) are initially set to `a[s] * k` and `a[b] * k`, respectively.

4. **Game Simulation:**
   - A loop runs up to `k` times (or until `k` becomes 0).
   - In each iteration:
     - The positions `b` and `s` are updated to their respective `p[b]` and `p[s]` positions.
     - The scores `sp` and `bp` are updated by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`, respectively.
     - The maximum possible scores `sm` and `bm` are updated by considering the new positions and the remaining number of turns `k`.

5. **Output Determination:**
   - After the loop, the program compares `bm` and `sm` to determine the winner.
   - If `bm > sm`, it prints "Bodya".
   - If `bm < sm`, it prints "Sasha".
   - If `bm == sm`, it prints "Draw".

#### Verification of Correctness

1. **Initialization:**
   - The initial scores `sp` and `bp` are correctly initialized to the starting values of `a[s]` and `a[b]`.

2. **Score Updates:**
   - The scores `sp` and `bp` are updated correctly by adding the values of `a[s]` and `a[b]` in each iteration.
   - The maximum possible scores `sm` and `bm` are updated correctly by considering the new positions and the remaining number of turns `k`.

3. **Position Updates:**
   - The positions `b` and `s` are updated correctly by moving to the positions specified by the permutation `p`.

4. **Final Comparison:**
   - The final comparison between `bm` and `sm` is done correctly to determine the winner.

#### Edge Cases
- The program handles the case where `k` is very large (up to \(10^9\)) by updating the scores and positions iteratively.
- The program correctly handles the case where the maximum possible scores are updated based on the remaining turns.

### Conclusion

After re-analyzing the program, it appears that the logic implemented in the function is correct according to the problem description. The program correctly simulates the game and determines the winner based on the given rules.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**

Final: **True**
