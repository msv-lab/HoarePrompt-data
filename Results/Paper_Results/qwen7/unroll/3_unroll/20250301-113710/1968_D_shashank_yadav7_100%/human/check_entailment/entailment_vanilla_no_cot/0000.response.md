Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given problem description. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. **Input Parsing**: For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, `b`, and `s` (the lengths of the permutation, duration of the game, and starting positions of Bodya and Sasha, respectively).
3. **Position and Score Initialization**: It initializes the starting scores for Bodya and Sasha using the values at their starting positions.
4. **Game Simulation**: The program simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores of both players based on the rules provided. It uses a loop to simulate each turn, updating the positions and scores accordingly.
5. **Decision Making**: After simulating the game, it compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha to determine the winner.

The logic for updating the scores and positions is correct, and the program handles all the necessary conditions to determine the outcome of the game. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided problem description.
