Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input for each test case, reading `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, and `P_S` for each test case. It then reads the permutation `p` and the array `a`.

2. **Index Adjustment**: The program correctly adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed.

3. **Score Calculation**: The program calculates the scores for both Bodya and Sasha over `k` turns. It uses the permutation `p` to determine the next position and updates the scores accordingly. The logic for updating the scores is correct:
   - The score is initially set to the value at the starting position.
   - For each turn, the score is updated by adding the value at the new position and considering the maximum possible score for the remaining turns.

4. **Comparison and Output**: The program correctly compares the final scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

5. **Loop Logic**: The loop logic is correct and ensures that the scores are updated correctly for each turn, considering the maximum possible score for the remaining turns.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
