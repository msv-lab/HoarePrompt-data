Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head involves the variable `i` and the value `n`.
2. **Determine the Initial State of `i` and `n`**:
   - The initial state of `i` is given as `None`.
   - The initial state of `n` is part of the return values of `func_4()`, but its exact value is not specified in the given state.

3. **Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`. This means `i` should iterate from 1 to `n-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` starts at `None`, it needs to be adjusted to `1` (the starting value of the loop).
   - `n` must be a positive integer greater than 1 for the loop to execute. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute.

5. **Other Variables**: The other variables (`max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, `index`, `D`, `F`) are not directly involved in the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`max_diff` is `-inf`, `next_max_diff` is `-inf`, `index` is `None`, `D` is a sorted list of unique elements from the return values of `func_4()`, `n` must be greater than 1, `F` is the return value of `func_4()`, `i` is `1`**
