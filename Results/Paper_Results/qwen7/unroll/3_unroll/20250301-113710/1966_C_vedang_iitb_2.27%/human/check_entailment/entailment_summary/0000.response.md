Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles. The game is played optimally, meaning both players will always make the best possible move.
2. The solution consists of two functions:
   - `func_1`: This function processes the input list `a` by removing duplicates, sorting, and calculating differences between consecutive elements. However, this processing is not directly related to determining the winner of the game.
   - `func_2`: This function recursively determines if the starting player can guarantee a win based on the current configuration of stone piles. It handles different cases depending on the number of piles (`n`), and uses a recursive approach to decide the outcome.
3. The main loop of the program reads the input, calls `func_1` to process the input list, and then calls `func_2` to determine the winner. Based on the output of `func_2`, it prints either "Alice" or "Bob".

Given the problem statement and the provided functions:
- `func_1` is not necessary for determining the winner, but it does not affect the correctness of `func_2`.
- `func_2` correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the number of piles and the initial configuration of stones.

Since `func_2` correctly implements the game logic and the main program structure is sound, the overall program meets the requirements of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
