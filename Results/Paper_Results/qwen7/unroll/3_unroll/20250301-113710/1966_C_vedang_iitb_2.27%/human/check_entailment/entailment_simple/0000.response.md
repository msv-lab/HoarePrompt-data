Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Game Logic**: 
   - The game involves multiple piles of stones, and on each turn, a player removes a positive integer \(k\) (where \(k \leq \text{min}(a_i)\)) from each non-empty pile simultaneously.
   - The player who cannot make a move (when all piles are empty) loses.
   - The key to solving this problem is to determine the Grundy number (or Nim-sum) for each pile and use the XOR operation to find the overall Grundy number. If the overall Grundy number is zero, the second player wins; otherwise, the first player wins.

2. **Analysis of Provided Code**:
   - The code does not correctly implement the logic for determining the winner. Specifically:
     - **Function `func_1`**:
       - This function sorts the unique elements of the list `a` and calculates differences between consecutive elements. However, this transformation does not help in determining the winner of the game.
     - **Function `func_2`**:
       - This function incorrectly handles the game logic. It does not compute the Grundy numbers or use the XOR operation to determine the winner. Instead, it makes decisions based on simple conditions that do not reflect the actual game rules.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To solve this problem correctly, we should calculate the Grundy number for each pile using the mex (minimum excluded value) function and then use the XOR operation on these Grundy numbers.
   - If the XOR of all Grundy numbers is zero, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Given that the provided code does not correctly implement the game logic and does not use the appropriate method to determine the winner, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
