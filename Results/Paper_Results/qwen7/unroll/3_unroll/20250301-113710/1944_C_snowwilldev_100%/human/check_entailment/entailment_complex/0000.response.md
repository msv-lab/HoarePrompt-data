Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Counting Logic**: The `cnt` dictionary is used to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. However, the subsequent logic to determine the MEX (Minimum Excludant) is flawed. The program checks if there is exactly one occurrence of any integer `i` in the range `[0, N]` and returns that integer. This approach does not account for the optimal strategy of both players.

2. **Optimal Strategy Not Considered**: The problem requires considering the optimal moves of both players. Alice aims to maximize the MEX, while Bob aims to minimize it. The current implementation does not simulate the optimal moves of both players. Instead, it simply counts occurrences and returns the first integer that meets the criteria, which is not a valid solution for the optimal game scenario.

3. **Return Value Issue**: The function returns `-1` if no integer meets the criteria within the loop. However, the problem specifies that the MEX should be calculated based on the final state of the array `c`, which is not reflected in the current implementation.

Given these issues, the provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
