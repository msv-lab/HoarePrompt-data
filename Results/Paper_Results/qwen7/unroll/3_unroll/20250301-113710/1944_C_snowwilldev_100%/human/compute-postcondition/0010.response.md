Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4), another positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list a of n non-negative integers (0 ≤ a_i < n). The function returns a result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing a value for t, n, and a list a. It processes these inputs and returns a specific result for each test case according to the provided constraints and relationships.
