Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `N`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of These Variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0.
   - `N` is given as an input integer.

3. **Determine the Condition for the Loop to Execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N + 1`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, it will start the loop.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `N + 1`.

Therefore, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `i` starts at 0 and `N` is an input integer, ensuring that the loop can execute at least once and continue until `i` reaches `N + 1`.

State: **`t` is 0, `N` is an input integer, `i` is 0**
