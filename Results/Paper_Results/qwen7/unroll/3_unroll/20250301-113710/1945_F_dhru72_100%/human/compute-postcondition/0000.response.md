Output State: **T is a TypeVar representing a type, `T` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `v` is a list of n positive integers such that 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and `p` is a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Additionally, the sum of the values of n over all test cases does not exceed 2·10^5.**

The code snippet `T = TypeVar('T')` defines a type variable `T` using the `TypeVar` function from the `typing` module. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the initial conditions for `t`, `n`, `v`, and `p` remain unchanged.
