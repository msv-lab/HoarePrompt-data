Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code `n_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds an integer value within the range 1 to 10^4.
