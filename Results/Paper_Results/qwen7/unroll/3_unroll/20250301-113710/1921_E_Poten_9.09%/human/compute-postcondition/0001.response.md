Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `answers` is an empty list.**

The code initializes an empty list named `answers`. The value of `test_cases` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) are also unaffected by this line of code.
