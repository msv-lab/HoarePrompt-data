Output State: **`test_cases` is an integer input within the range 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, and all other variables (h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b) are yet to be defined.**

This means that the variable `test_cases` has been assigned the value of an integer input from the user, which is constrained to be between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The other variables (`h`, `w`, `x_a`, `y_a`, `x_b`, `y_b`) have not yet been assigned any values and remain undefined.
