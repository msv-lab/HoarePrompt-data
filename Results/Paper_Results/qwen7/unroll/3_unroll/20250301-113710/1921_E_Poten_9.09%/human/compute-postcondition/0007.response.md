Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b where 1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6 and 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9. The function returns a value based on whether (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are distinct points and within the given ranges.**

This means the function is expected to validate the provided integers against specified constraints and determine if the points (x_a, y_a) and (x_b, y_b) are distinct and fall within the defined ranges for h and w. However, since the function definition itself does not appear in the provided code snippet, the exact return value (e.g., True/False or some other value) is not specified here.
