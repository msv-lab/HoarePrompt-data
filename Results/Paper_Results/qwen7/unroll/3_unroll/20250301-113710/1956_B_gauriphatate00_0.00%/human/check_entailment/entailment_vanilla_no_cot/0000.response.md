Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided solution correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each card value.
   - It then calculates the number of pairs (i.e., cards with the same value) and returns the minimum of this count and half the number of cards (`n // 2`). This ensures that the function returns the maximum possible points you can get while considering Nene's optimal strategy.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly handles the reading of multiple test cases and outputs the results for each case.

Given the problem constraints and the provided examples, the solution works as expected. The logic aligns with the problem statement, and the implementation is correct.
