### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the maximum number of points you can get in the game.
   - Nene will always play optimally to maximize her score and minimize your score.
   - You want to maximize your score under this condition.

2. **Analyzing `func_1`:**
   - This function calculates the minimum of two values:
     1. The number of pairs of cards in your hand (where a pair means two cards with the same number).
     2. Half of the total number of cards you have (`n // 2`).
   - The logic here is that Nene will always try to block your points by placing cards on the table when possible. If you have more than half of the cards in pairs, Nene can block all but one of those pairs, giving you at most one point per pair.

3. **Analyzing `func_2`:**
   - This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It correctly parses the input and outputs the results.

4. **Correctness Check:**
   - The logic in `func_1` is sound because:
     - If you have more than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can block all but one of those pairs, giving you at most one point per pair.
     - If you have fewer or equal to `n // 2` pairs, Nene can block all pairs, giving you zero points.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not fully capture the optimal strategy for maximizing your score. Specifically, it does not account for the fact that Nene will always try to block your points by placing cards on the table, which might allow you to get more than just one point per pair.

   - For example, consider the following scenario:
     - You have the cards: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`.
     - Nene will play optimally to block your points. Here's how the game might proceed:
       1. You play a card with 1, Nene blocks it by playing a card with 1.
       2. You play a card with 2, Nene blocks it by playing a card with 2.
       3. You play a card with 3, Nene blocks it by playing a card with 3.
     - In this case, you would get 3 points, but `func_1` would only return 1 because it only considers the number of pairs and not the optimal blocking strategy.

   - Therefore, the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the optimal strategy for maximizing your score.

Given the above analysis, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
