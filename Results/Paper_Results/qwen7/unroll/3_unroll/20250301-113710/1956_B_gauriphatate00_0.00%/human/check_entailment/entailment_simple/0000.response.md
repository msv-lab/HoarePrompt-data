Reasoning:
1. **Function 1 Analysis**: The function `func_1(n, a)` correctly calculates the number of pairs of cards in your hand. It uses a `Counter` to count occurrences of each integer in the list `a`. Then, it sums up the number of integers that appear exactly twice (`count == 2`). Finally, it returns the minimum value between this sum and `n // 2`. This logic is correct because Nene will always try to maximize her score by pairing her cards with yours, and the maximum number of points you can get is limited by the number of pairs you can form without letting Nene pair her cards with yours.

2. **Function 2 Analysis**: The function `func_2()` reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1(n, a)` for each test case. It correctly handles reading the input, splitting it into relevant parts, and calling `func_1` with the appropriate parameters. The results are stored in a list and printed out. The logic here is also correct as it adheres to the problem statement and ensures that each test case is processed independently.

Given that both functions correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem, the annotated program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
