Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_1` aims to calculate the maximum number of points you can get.
   - It uses a `Counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the list `a`.
   - It then counts how many integers appear exactly twice (`pairs`).
   - Finally, it returns the minimum value between the number of such pairs and half the number of cards (`n // 2`).
   - This logic is correct because:
     - If there are fewer than `n // 2` pairs, Nene can always pair up the remaining cards, preventing you from scoring any points.
     - If there are `n // 2` or more pairs, you can strategically place your cards to ensure you get at least `n // 2` points, as Nene will try to minimize your score.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis:**
   - The function `func_2` processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the input, extracts the necessary data for each test case, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.
   - The logic here is also correct because:
     - It correctly handles reading multiple test cases.
     - It passes the correct parameters to `func_1` for each test case.
     - It prints the results in the correct format.

Given that both functions work as intended and correctly implement the solution, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
