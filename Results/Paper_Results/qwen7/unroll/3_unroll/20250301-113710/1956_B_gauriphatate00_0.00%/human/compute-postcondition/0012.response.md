The function `func_2` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition but seems to imply it should take parameters based on the context provided. It accepts three parameters: `t`, `n`, and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, with a constraint of 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer representing the number of cards in each player's hand, with a constraint of 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; and `a` is a list of integers representing the integers on the cards in your hand, with constraints of 1 ≤ a_i ≤ n and each integer from 1 through n appearing in the list `a` at most 2 times.

Based on the output cases described, the function does not return a value directly but seems to process the input parameters and potentially return some form of result (though not explicitly stated).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `a`. For each test case specified by `t`, it processes a list `a` which contains integers representing cards in a player's hand, and determines some outcome based on the values and constraints provided, though the exact nature of the return value is not specified.**
