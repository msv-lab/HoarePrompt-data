Output State: **idx is 2 + 2 * t, t is unchanged, data is unchanged, n is an integer obtained from int(data[0]), a is a list of integers obtained from data starting from idx + t to idx + 2 * t, results is a list of outputs from func_1(n, a) for each iteration.**

Explanation: The loop runs `t` times. Each iteration increments `idx` by `n` (which is the value of the first element in `data` starting from the index `idx`), and appends the result of `func_1(n, a)` to `results`. After all iterations, `idx` will be incremented by `2 * t` because it starts with 2 and gets incremented by `n` in each of the `t` iterations. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `data` remains unchanged. The variable `n` is determined by the first element of `data` starting from the index `idx` at the beginning of each iteration, and `a` is a list of integers obtained from `data` starting from `idx + t` to `idx + 2 * t`. The `results` list contains the outputs of `func_1(n, a)` for each iteration.
