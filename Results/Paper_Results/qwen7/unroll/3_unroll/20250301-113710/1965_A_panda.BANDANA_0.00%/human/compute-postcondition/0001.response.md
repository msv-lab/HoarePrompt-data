State: **`t` must be greater than 0 and `i` must be 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop `for i in range(t):` will iterate from `0` to `t-1`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than `0`.
3. The variable `i` starts at `0` in the first iteration of the loop, but the problem asks for the state at the start of the loop, which means just before the first iteration begins.
4. Therefore, `i` should be set to `1` to reflect its value at the start of the first iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than `0` and `i` is `1` for the loop to execute.
