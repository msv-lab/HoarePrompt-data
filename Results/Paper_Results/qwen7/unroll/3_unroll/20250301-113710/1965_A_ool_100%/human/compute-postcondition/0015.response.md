Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile. It first removes duplicates and sorts the list. Then, it checks if the smallest number is 1. If not, it returns 'Alice'. Next, it iterates through the sorted unique elements to determine if the difference between any two consecutive elements is greater than 1. If such a difference is found, it sets a flag to False and breaks the loop. After the loop, it toggles a boolean value based on the length of the unique elements list. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if the length of the unique elements list is even, otherwise it returns 'Bob'.**
