You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers representing the number of stones in each pile, and the length of arr (n) satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. Each integer in the list represents the initial number of stones in a pile and satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9.
def func_1(arr):
    A = False
    set_ = list(set(arr))
    set_.sort()
    if (set_[0] != 1) :
        return 'Alice'
        #The program returns 'Alice'
    #State: `A` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1
    not_c = True
    for i in range(1, len(set_)):
        if set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1:
            not_c = False
            break
        
        A = not A
        
    #State: Output State: `A` is True, `not_c` is False, `set_` is a list of unique elements from `arr` sorted in ascending order, and the first element of `set_` is 1.
    #
    #Explanation: The loop iterates through the elements of `set_` starting from the second element. If the difference between consecutive elements is greater than 1, `not_c` is set to False and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `A` toggles between True and False with each iteration. Since the loop starts from `i=1`, it will check the difference between each pair of consecutive elements (i and i-1). If no such pair exists where the difference is greater than 1, `not_c` remains True, but since the loop will eventually break when the condition is met, `not_c` becomes False. The value of `A` will be True if the number of iterations is even, and False if it's odd. Given the loop starts from `i=1` and goes up to `len(set_) - 1`, the number of iterations is always one less than the length of `set_`, which means `A` will be True if the length of `set_` is even, and False if it's odd. However, without knowing the exact length of `set_`, we can only definitively say that `not_c` will be False if the condition `set_[i] - set_[i - 1] > 1` is ever met during the loop.
    if not_c :
        A = not A
    #State: `A` is True if the length of `set_` is even, and False if it's odd. `not_c` is False if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `set_` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `not_c` remains True.
    return 'Alice' if A else 'Bob'
    #The program returns 'Alice' if the length of set_ is even, and 'Bob' if it's odd.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers. Each integer in the list represents the number of stones in a pile, and the length of the list satisfies 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5. The function returns 'Alice' if the length of the set of unique elements in arr is even, and 'Bob' if it's odd.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns 'Alice'

Case_2: The program returns 'Alice' if the length of set_ is even, and 'Bob' if it's odd.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
