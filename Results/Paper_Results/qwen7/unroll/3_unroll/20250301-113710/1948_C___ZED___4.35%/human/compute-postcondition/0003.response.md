Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>', representing the direction of the arrow in each cell of the respective row of the grid. The function returns a value based on the conditions specified for the characters in the strings.**

Given the constraints, the function likely evaluates the relationship between the two strings of length n, where each character is either '<' or '>'. However, since no specific output cases are provided, the exact return value cannot be detailed without additional information.
