The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is even), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings. If any condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads input values from standard input and outputs results to standard output.
