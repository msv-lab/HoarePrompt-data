You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There is a grid, consisting of 2 rows and n columns. The rows are numbered
from 1 to 2 from top to bottom. The columns are numbered from 1 to n from left
to right. Each cell of the grid contains an arrow pointing either to the left
or to the right. No arrow points outside the grid.

There is a robot that starts in a cell (1, 1) . Every second, the following
two actions happen one after another:

  1. Firstly, the robot moves left, right, down or up (it can't try to go outside the grid, and can't skip a move); 
  2. then it moves along the arrow that is placed in the current cell (the cell it ends up after its move). 

Your task is to determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ).

The second line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or
> — the first row of the grid.

The third line contains a string consisting of exactly n characters < and/or >
— the second row of the grid.

Additional constraints on the input:

  * n is even; 
  * there are no arrows pointing outside the grid; 
  * the sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 . 

Output

For each test case, print YES if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) ;
otherwise, print NO.

You can print each letter in any case. For example, yes, Yes, YeS will all be
recognized as positive answer.

Example

Input

    >><<><
    
    ><>>><

Output

    YES
    YES
    NO
    YES
    
Note

In the first example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3) \rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) .

In the second example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) .

In the third example, there is no way to reach the cell (2, 4) .

In the fourth example, one of the possible paths looks as follows: (1, 1)
\rightarrow (2, 1) \rightarrow (2, 2) \rightarrow (1, 2) \rightarrow (1, 3)
\rightarrow (2, 3) \rightarrow (2, 4) \rightarrow (2, 5) \rightarrow (2, 6) .

- Program:
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        if b[-2] != '>':
            print('NO')
        elif n == 1:
            print('YES')
        else:
            no_path = True
            for k in range(0, n, 2):
                if b[k] != '>':
                    no_path = False
            if not no_path:
                no_path = True
                for k in range(1, n - 1, 2):
                    print(k)
                    if a[k] != '>':
                        no_path = False
            if no_path:
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two strings of length n (where n is even), containing characters '<' or '>'. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the characters in these strings. If any condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters directly but reads input values from standard input and outputs results to standard output.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n`, the first row of arrows `a`, and the second row of arrows `b`.

2. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the last two arrows in the second row `b` are not both `>`, the function immediately prints 'NO'. This check ensures that the robot cannot move from the second column to the third column in the last two cells.
   - If `n` is 1, the function prints 'YES'. This is a special case where the robot only needs to move down to reach (2, 1).

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program sets a flag `no_path` to `True` initially.
   - It iterates through every other column (starting from index 0) in the second row `b`. If any arrow is `<`, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - If `no_path` remains `True` after checking the second row, it sets another flag `no_path` to `True` and checks the first row `a` for every other column (starting from index 1).
     - If any arrow in the first row `a` is `<`, it sets `no_path` to `False`.
   - Finally, it prints 'YES' if `no_path` is still `True`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - The check for `b[-2]` is correct because it ensures the robot can move from the second-to-last column to the last column in the second row.
   - The check for `n == 1` is also correct because in this case, the robot only needs to move down to reach (2, 1).

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The logic for checking the second row `b` is correct. If any arrow in the second row is `<`, the robot cannot move to the next column, so `no_path` should be set to `False`.
   - However, the logic for checking the first row `a` is flawed. The program should ensure that the robot can move from the first row to the second row and then to the last column. The current logic only checks if the first row has any `<` arrows but does not account for the movement from the first row to the second row.

### Example Counter-Case:

Consider the following input:
```
4
4
><>>
>>><
```

- The second row `b` ends with `>`, so the initial check passes.
- The first row `a` has `<` at index 1 and 3, which means the robot cannot move from the first row to the second row in those columns.
- The program incorrectly prints 'YES' because it only checks the first row without ensuring the robot can move from the first row to the second row.

### Conclusion:

The given program is incorrect because it does not properly check if the robot can move from the first row to the second row. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Correctness: **False**
