Output State: **`tt` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases; all other variables retain their initial states.**

This means that `tt` now holds the number of test cases as an integer, while `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and the lists of integers remain unchanged from their initial states.
