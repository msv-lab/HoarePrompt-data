The function processes multiple test cases, each containing integers n, x, and y, followed by x distinct integers from 1 to n. It sorts these integers, calculates a value `ans` based on specific conditions, and adjusts `ans` using a temporary list `tmp`. Finally, it prints the minimum value between `ans` and `n-2` for each test case.
