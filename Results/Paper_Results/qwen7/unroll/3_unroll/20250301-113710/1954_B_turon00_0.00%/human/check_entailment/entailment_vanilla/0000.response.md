### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where any element `a_i` (for `2 ≤ i ≤ n-1`) can be replaced with `a_{i-1}` if `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a`.
   - It initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to get unique elements in the array.
   - If all elements are the same (`len(aa) == 1`), it prints `-1` because no removals are needed to make it non-beautiful.
   - It then iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updates `ans` with the minimum count of consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it prints `ans`.

3. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The logic for checking if the array is already non-beautiful when all elements are the same is correct.
   - The approach to count consecutive elements and find the minimum count seems to be aimed at finding the smallest segment that needs to be removed to break the beauty property.
   - However, the logic to determine if the array can be made non-beautiful by removing elements is flawed. Specifically, the solution only checks for consecutive elements but doesn't ensure that removing these elements will break the beauty property.

4. **Counterexample**:
   - Consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The solution would incorrectly print `1`, but removing just one element won't necessarily break the beauty property. Removing the middle `2` results in `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, which is still beautiful.

### Conclusion:
The given solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

**Correctness: False**
