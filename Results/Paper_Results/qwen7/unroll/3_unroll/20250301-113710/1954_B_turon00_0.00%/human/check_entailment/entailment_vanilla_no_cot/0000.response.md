Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the logic to determine the minimum number of elements that need to be removed to make the array non-beautiful. The solution checks for consecutive identical elements but does not account for the specific operation described in the problem statement, which involves replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` when `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to identify the longest subsequence where the operation can be repeatedly applied until all elements are equal. Then, the answer would be the total length of the array minus the length of this longest subsequence.

Here is a corrected version of the solution:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find the longest subsequence where the operation can be applied
        max_length = 1
        current_length = 1
        
        for i in range(1, n-1):
            if a[i-1] == a[i+1]:
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 1
        
        # If the entire array can become uniform by the operation, return -1
        if max_length == n:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print(n - max_length)

# Example usage
func()
```

This solution iterates through the array to find the longest subsequence where the operation can be applied. If the entire array can become uniform by the operation, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.
