### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of elements to remove from a given array to make it non-beautiful.
   - An array is considered beautiful if we can make all its elements the same by repeatedly replacing `a_i` with `a_{i-1}` where `a_{i-1} = a_{i+1}`.

2. **Given Solution Analysis:**
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if all elements in the array are the same. If they are, it prints `-1` because the array cannot be made non-beautiful.
   - Otherwise, it initializes `tmp` with the first element of the array and uses a set `aa` to get unique elements.
   - It iterates through the array to count consecutive elements equal to `tmp` and updates the answer (`ans`) with the minimum count of consecutive elements.
   - Finally, it prints the minimum count found.

3. **Correctness Check:**
   - **Edge Case Handling:** The solution correctly handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.
   - **Logic for Counting Consecutive Elements:** The logic for counting consecutive elements and updating the minimum count seems correct.
   - **Set Usage:** Using a set to find unique elements is unnecessary and can be simplified. The set is only used to check if there are multiple unique elements, but this information is not utilized in the final logic. We can directly check for consecutive elements without needing a set.
   - **Final Answer Calculation:** The final answer calculation seems to be based on finding the minimum length of consecutive elements which is a valid approach to determine the minimum removals needed.

4. **Potential Issues:**
   - The use of `set` to find unique elements is redundant since we can directly check for consecutive elements without needing a set.
   - The logic for determining the minimum removals could be optimized further, but the current implementation seems to work.

5. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function summary states that the function processes a series of test cases and prints the minimum length of consecutive segments with the same number in the list `a`. This is not entirely accurate because the function also checks if all elements are the same and prints `-1` in that case.

### Conclusion:
The given solution appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality. However, the function summary is misleading because it does not accurately reflect the full behavior of the function. The function also handles the case where all elements are the same by printing `-1`.

### Correctness:
The original assessment is accurate in terms of the logic and functionality of the program, but the function summary is not fully accurate. Given that the program works as intended and the original assessment correctly identifies this, the overall correctness remains true.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
