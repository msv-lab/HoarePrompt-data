Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The variables involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 (the starting value of the range function).
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` is always initialized to 0 when using `range(n)`, we don't need to adjust its initial value.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `n` is an input integer

We need to adjust the state of `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` must be at least 1**
