Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases where each test case contains three non-negative integers a, b, and c representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively. The function returns the result for each test case based on the given conditions.**

This means the function is expected to take a series of test cases (each containing three integers) as input indirectly through a list or similar structure, process each test case according to certain rules, and return the results for each test case.
