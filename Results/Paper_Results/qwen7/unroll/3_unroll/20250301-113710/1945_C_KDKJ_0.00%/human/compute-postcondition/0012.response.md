Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer representing the number of houses (with a constraint of 3 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5), and `a`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '0' and '1'. The function returns a value indicating whether the distribution of house preferences (`0` for left side, `1` for right side) is balanced or not.**

- If the number of '0's (houses preferring the left side) equals the number of '1's (houses preferring the right side), the function returns a value indicating balance.
- Otherwise, the function returns a value indicating imbalance.
