State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer such that `start` <= `end`, `t` is an input integer, `i` is 0, `t` must be at least 1**.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the variable `t`.
2. The loop will execute as long as `t` is at least 1.
3. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point of the `range(t)` function).
4. The value of `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` set to 0 and `t` must be at least 1.
