Output State: The output state will consist of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' responses based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, the value of `n` (obtained from `input()`) and the string `a` (also obtained from `input()`) are used to determine if the number of '1's in `a` meets certain criteria, and then either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed accordingly. The initial values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and the variable `t` reflects the total number of iterations performed.
