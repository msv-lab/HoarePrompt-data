Based on the initial state provided:

- `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`.
- `t`, `n`, and `arr` remain unchanged.
- `mex` is a list containing the differences between elements in `arr` and `minn`, or `minn` itself if the difference is negative.
- `maxx` is the maximum difference found between elements in `arr` and `minn`.

The loop prints each element of `mex` separated by a space. Since the exact values of `arr` and `minn` are not provided, we can only describe the general form of the output.

Given that `minn` is greater than or equal to the maximum value in `arr`, all elements in `arr` will have a non-negative difference with `minn`. Therefore, `mex` will contain the differences between each element in `arr` and `minn`.

Let's denote the elements of `arr` as `a1, a2, ..., an` where `n` is the length of `arr`. The differences will be `minn - a1, minn - a2, ..., minn - an`.

Since the loop prints each element of `mex` separated by a space, the output will be a series of these differences.

Output: **minn - a1 minn - a2 ... minn - an**
