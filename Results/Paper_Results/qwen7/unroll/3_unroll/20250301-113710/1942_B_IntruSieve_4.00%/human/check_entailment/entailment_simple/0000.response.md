Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. This is correct according to the problem statement.

2. **Array Processing**: In the function `func_1`, the program initializes variables `minn` and `maxx` to keep track of the minimum and maximum values encountered. It then iterates through the array `arr` to compute the MEX values and store them in the list `mex`. 

   - For each element in `arr`:
     - If the element is positive, it means the MEX value should be the current `minn`, which is added to `mex`, and `minn` is incremented.
     - If the element is negative, the MEX value is computed as the absolute difference between the current `minn` and the negative element, ensuring that the MEX value is valid and stored in `mex`.

3. **Output**: After computing the MEX values, the program prints each element of `mex` separated by spaces. However, this does not directly provide the permutation `p` but rather the MEX values derived from `p`.

4. **Permutation Construction**: The problem requires constructing a permutation `p` that satisfies the given conditions. The program does not actually construct the permutation `p` but instead prints the MEX values. This is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Given the above analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated. It computes and prints the MEX values derived from the permutation `p` but does not construct and return the permutation itself.

Correctness: **False**
