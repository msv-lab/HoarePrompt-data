### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) (number of buns sold at the modified price).
   - The profit calculation should consider both the modified price for the first \( k \) buns and the usual price for the remaining \( n - k \) buns.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - The provided code uses binary search to find the optimal \( k \). However, the function `func_1` is not correctly calculating the profit.
   - The binary search logic does not seem to be appropriate for this problem since the profit function is not strictly increasing or decreasing with respect to \( k \).
   - The condition in `func_1` is incorrect and does not help in finding the maximum profit.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - Instead of using binary search, we can directly calculate the profit for different values of \( k \) from 0 to \( n \) and find the maximum profit.
   - For each \( k \), the profit is calculated as:
     - The sum of the modified prices for the first \( k \) buns: \( \sum_{i=1}^{k} (b - i + 1) \).
     - The sum of the usual prices for the remaining \( n - k \) buns: \( (n - k) \times a \).

4. **Correct Implementation**:
   - Calculate the profit for \( k = 0 \) to \( k = n \).
   - Return the maximum profit found.

The original assessment correctly identified that the binary search approach and the profit calculation in `func_1` were incorrect. The proposed corrected version of the program is indeed correct and follows the proper approach to solve the problem.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is incorrect due to the inappropriate use of binary search and the flawed profit calculation function. The corrected version provided in the original assessment is correct.
