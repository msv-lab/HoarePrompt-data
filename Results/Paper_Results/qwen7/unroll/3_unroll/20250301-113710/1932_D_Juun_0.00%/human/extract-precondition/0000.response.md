Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, and the trump suit is one of "CDHS". The third line of each test case contains 2n unique two-character strings representing the cards, where the first character is the rank ('2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9') and the second character is the suit ('C', 'D', 'H', 'S').**
