Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case defined by the variables t, n, and array a, where t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, and a is a list of n integers each between 1 and n inclusive. The function returns a result based on the properties of the array a, which is guaranteed to be beautiful.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by the variables t, n, and the array a, and it returns a specific result related to the array a, leveraging its guaranteed beautiful property.
