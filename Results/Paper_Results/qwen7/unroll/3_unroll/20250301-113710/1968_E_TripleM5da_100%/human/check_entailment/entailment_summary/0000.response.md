Reasoning:
The given program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program always prints the same pattern regardless of the value of \( n \). Specifically, it prints:
1. `1 1`
2. `1 2`
3. For each \( i \) from 3 to \( n \), it prints `i i`.

This pattern does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances. The execution summary indicates that the program's output is consistent with the examples provided in the problem statement, but these examples do not guarantee that the output will always maximize \(\mathcal{H}\).

To properly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\), different strategies might be needed depending on the value of \( n \). For example, the optimal strategy for \( n = 3 \) involves placing points in specific positions to achieve the maximum number of unique Manhattan distances, which is not achieved by the simple pattern used in the given program.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all values of \( n \).

Correctness: **False**
