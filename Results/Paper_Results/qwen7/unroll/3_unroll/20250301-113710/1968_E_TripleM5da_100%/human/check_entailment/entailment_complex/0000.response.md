Reasoning:
1. The problem requires maximizing the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
2. The annotated program attempts to solve this by always printing the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and then for each integer \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints the point \((i, i)\).

To evaluate the correctness, let's consider the Manhattan distances generated by this approach:
- The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((1, 2)\) is \(1\).
- The distance between \((1, 1)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(i - 1\).
- The distance between \((1, 2)\) and \((i, i)\) for \(i \geq 3\) is \(i - 1 + |2 - i|\).

For \(i \geq 3\), the distances are \(2, 3, 4, \ldots, n-1\). This means the set \(\mathcal{H}\) will contain the elements \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, n-1\}\).

This set has \(n-1\) elements, which is the maximum possible size of \(\mathcal{H}\) because the maximum distance between any two points in an \(n \times n\) grid is \(2(n-1)\), but we can achieve all intermediate distances by carefully choosing the points.

Given that the program generates the required set of points and the distances, it correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

Correctness: **True**
