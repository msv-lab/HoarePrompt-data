Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program takes an integer input `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - The program prints the coordinates of the cells as follows:
     - The first two cells are placed at (1, 1) and (1, 2).
     - For each subsequent cell from 3 to `n`, the cell is placed at coordinates `(i, i)`.

3. **Checking the Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (i, i) for \( i \geq 3 \) is \( |1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1) \).
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (i, i) for \( i \geq 3 \) is \( |1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1) - 1 \).

4. **Ensuring Distinct Distances**:
   - By placing the cells as described, the distances will be:
     - 1 (between (1, 1) and (1, 2))
     - 2, 4, 6, ..., 2(n-1) (between (1, 1) and (3, 3), (1, 1) and (4, 4), ..., (1, 1) and (n, n))
     - 1, 3, 5, ..., 2(n-1)-1 (between (1, 2) and (3, 3), (1, 2) and (4, 4), ..., (1, 2) and (n, n))
   - These distances are all distinct and cover a wide range, ensuring the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement confirm that this placement strategy works for various values of \( n \).

Conclusion:
The given program correctly places the cells to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \( n \) within the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
