Output State: The output consists of multiple lines where each line contains two integers. For each test case, the output starts with two lines `1 1` and `1 2`. Then, for each integer `n` in the range from 3 to `n`, there is a line containing `i i`. The total number of lines depends on the value of `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the value of `n` for each test case).
