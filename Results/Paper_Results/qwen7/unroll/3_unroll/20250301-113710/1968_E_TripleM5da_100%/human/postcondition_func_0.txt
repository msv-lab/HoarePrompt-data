The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `n`. For each test case, it outputs a series of lines. Each line contains two identical integers starting from 1 up to `n`. Specifically, it first prints `1 1` and then `1 2`, followed by lines of the form `i i` for each integer `i` from 3 to `n`. The function reads the number of test cases `t` and the value of `n` for each test case from standard input.
