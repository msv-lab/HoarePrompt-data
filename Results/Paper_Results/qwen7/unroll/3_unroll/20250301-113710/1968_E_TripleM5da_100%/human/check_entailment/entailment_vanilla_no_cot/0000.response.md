Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program only prints the coordinates \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and then for each subsequent row from 3 to \( n \), it prints \((i, i)\). This approach does not necessarily maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, consider \( n = 3 \):
- The program outputs:
  ```
  1 1
  1 2
  3 3
  3 3
  ```

However, the optimal solution for \( n = 3 \) should be:
```
2 1
2 3
3 1
```
This configuration gives the set of Manhattan distances \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\), which has a size of 4.

The program fails to explore other configurations that might yield a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances. Therefore, the program is not correct for all cases.
