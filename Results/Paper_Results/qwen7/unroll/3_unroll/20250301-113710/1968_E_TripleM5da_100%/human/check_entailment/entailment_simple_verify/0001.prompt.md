You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n . You choose n cells (x_1,y_1),
(x_2,y_2),\dots,(x_n,y_n) in the grid n\times n where 1\le x_i\le n and 1\le
y_i\le n .

Let \mathcal{H} be the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of
cells. Your task is to maximize the size of \mathcal{H} . Examples of sets and
their construction are given in the notes.

If there exists more than one solution, you are allowed to output any.

Manhattan distance between cells (x_1,y_1) and (x_2,y_2) equals
|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2| .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (2\le n\le 10^3 ).

Output

For each test case, output n points which maximize the size of \mathcal{H} .
It is not necessary to output an empty line at the end of the answer for each
test case.

Note

In the first testcase we have n=2 . One of the possible arrangements is:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/4d7adaa08c9ee5ebf2a0caba13185ac968d6bcd9.png)
The arrangement with cells located in (1,1) and (1,2) . In this case
\mathcal{H}=\\{|1-1|+|1-1|,|1-1|+|2-2|,|1-1|+|1-2|\\}=\\{0,0,1\\}=\\{0,1\\} .
Hence, the size of \mathcal{H} is 2 . It can be shown that it is the greatest
possible answer.

In the second testcase we have n=3 . The optimal arrangement is:

The arrangement with cells located in (2,1) , (2,3) and (3,1) .

\mathcal{H}
=\\{|2-2|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|3-3|,|3-3|+|1-1|,|2-2|+|1-3|,|2-3|+|1-1|,|2-3|+|3-1|\\}
=\\{0,0,0,2,1,3\\} =\\{0,1,2,3\\} .

For n=4 a possible arrangement is:

For n=5 a possible arrangement is:

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        print(1, 1)
        print(1, 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            print(i, i)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3.
def func():
    for i in range(0, int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        print(1, 1)
        
        print(1, 2)
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):

    #State: Output State: The output consists of multiple lines where each line contains two integers. For each test case, the output starts with two lines `1 1` and `1 2`. Then, for each integer `n` in the range from 3 to `n`, there is a line containing `i i`. The total number of lines depends on the value of `t` (the number of test cases) and `n` (the value of `n` for each test case).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to place \( n \) cells in an \( n \times n \) grid such that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells is maximized.
2. **Analyzing the Given Program**:
   - The program takes an integer input `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`.
   - The program prints the coordinates of the cells as follows:
     - The first two cells are placed at (1, 1) and (1, 2).
     - For each subsequent cell from 3 to `n`, the cell is placed at coordinates `(i, i)`.

3. **Checking the Manhattan Distance Calculation**:
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is \( |1-1| + |1-2| = 1 \).
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (i, i) for \( i \geq 3 \) is \( |1-i| + |1-i| = 2(i-1) \).
   - The Manhattan distance between (1, 2) and (i, i) for \( i \geq 3 \) is \( |1-i| + |2-i| = 2(i-1) - 1 \).

4. **Ensuring Distinct Distances**:
   - By placing the cells as described, the distances will be:
     - 1 (between (1, 1) and (1, 2))
     - 2, 4, 6, ..., 2(n-1) (between (1, 1) and (3, 3), (1, 1) and (4, 4), ..., (1, 1) and (n, n))
     - 1, 3, 5, ..., 2(n-1)-1 (between (1, 2) and (3, 3), (1, 2) and (4, 4), ..., (1, 2) and (n, n))
   - These distances are all distinct and cover a wide range, ensuring the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

5. **Verification**:
   - The provided examples in the problem statement confirm that this placement strategy works for various values of \( n \).

Conclusion:
The given program correctly places the cells to maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for any \( n \) within the specified range.
