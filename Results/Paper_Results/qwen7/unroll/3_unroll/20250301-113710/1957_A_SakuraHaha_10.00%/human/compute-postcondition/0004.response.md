Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head contains the variable `x`, which is iterating over the list `a`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `x`**: Since `x` is being assigned values from the list `a` during each iteration, we need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` must contain at least one integer.

4. **Adjust the state**: We need to ensure that the list `a` has at least one element. The other variables (`ans`, `t`, `n`, `cnt`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Based on this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is the list `a` having at least one element.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`ans` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a non-empty list of integers, `cnt` is an empty dictionary**
