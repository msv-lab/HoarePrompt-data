Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes input through a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) indicating the number of subsequent test cases, followed by `t` sets of data. Each set consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100). For each set, it processes the integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and returns a result based on these integers.**

This describes that the function indirectly accepts a series of test cases, each containing an integer `t` to denote the number of subsequent sets of data, followed by `t` sets of data, each consisting of an integer `n` and `n` integers within specified ranges. The function processes these integers and returns results accordingly for each set.
