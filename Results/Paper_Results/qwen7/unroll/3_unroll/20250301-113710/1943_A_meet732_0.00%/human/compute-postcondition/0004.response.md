Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list \( a \) of \( n \) non-negative integers. For each test case, it counts the occurrences of each integer in the list \( a \). If the count of zeros is not zero, it finds and prints the smallest index \( j \) (where \( 1 \leq j \leq n \)) such that the count of \( j \) is less than 2; otherwise, it prints 0. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
