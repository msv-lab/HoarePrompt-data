Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head:**
   - The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.
   - The only variable involved here is the placeholder `_`, which is used as a dummy variable to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.

2. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - Since `_` is a dummy variable, it doesn't need to be explicitly adjusted.
   - The key information needed for the loop to execute correctly is the value of `int(input())`, which determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Understand the Context:**
   - The problem states that `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^4\).
   - Each test case involves an integer `n` (number of elements in the list `a`) and a list `a` of `n` non-negative integers, each less than `n`.
   - The sum of all `n` values across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

4. **Formulate the State Adjustment:**
   - To ensure the loop runs the correct number of times, we need to set the value of `t` (the number of test cases) to be within the given range.
   - Since the loop body is omitted, no specific adjustments are needed for `n` or the list `a` within the loop itself.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `t` to ensure the loop can execute.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4**
