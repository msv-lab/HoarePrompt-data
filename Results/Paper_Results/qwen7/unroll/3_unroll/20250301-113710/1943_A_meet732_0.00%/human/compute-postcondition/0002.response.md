Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 2⋅10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer is less than n. After executing the loop, if cntl[0] is not zero, then the minimum value of j (where 1 ≤ j ≤ n) such that cntl[j] is less than 2 is printed; otherwise, 0 is printed. The sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.
