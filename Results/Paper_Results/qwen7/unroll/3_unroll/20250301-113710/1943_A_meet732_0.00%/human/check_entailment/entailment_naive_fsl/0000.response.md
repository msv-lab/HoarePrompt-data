Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules and the calculation of the MEX value. Specifically, the program does not account for the optimal strategies of both players. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should always pick elements that maximize the MEX value in her favor. However, the current implementation does not ensure that Alice picks the optimal elements to achieve this.

2. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should pick elements to minimize the MEX value. The current implementation does not handle this aspect correctly either.

Let's consider a specific example to illustrate the issue:

**Test Case:**
```
3
4
0 0 1 1
```

**Expected Output:**
```
2
```

**Program Execution:**
- Alice picks `0` (cntl[0] becomes 1).
- Bob picks `0` (cntl[0] becomes 0).
- Alice picks `1` (cntl[1] becomes 1).
- Bob picks `1` (cntl[1] becomes 0).

At the end, `cntl` is `[0, 0, 1]`. The MEX of `[1]` is `0`, but the correct MEX should be `2` based on the optimal play.

The program incorrectly calculates the MEX without considering the optimal moves for both players. Therefore, the program is not correct.
