The function reads multiple pairs of integers \(x\) and \(y\) from the user, compares them, and prints the pair in ascending order. Specifically, for each pair, if \(x < y\), it prints \(x, y\); otherwise, it prints \(y, x\). The function does not return any value; its purpose is to process and output the sorted pairs based on the given conditions.
