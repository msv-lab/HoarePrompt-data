Reasoning:
- The problem requires outputting the minimum and maximum of two integers for each test case.
- The annotated program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading two integers `x` and `y`.
- For each pair of integers, it checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints `x` followed by `y`; otherwise, it prints `y` followed by `x`.
- This logic correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers and outputs them in the required format.
- The provided example input and output match the expected behavior of the program.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **True**
