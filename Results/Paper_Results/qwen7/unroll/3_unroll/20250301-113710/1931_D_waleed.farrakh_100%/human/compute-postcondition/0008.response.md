Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. Each `arr` is a list of `n` integers. The value of `idx` is `2 * t + 1`, and `results` is the return value of `func_1(test_cases)`**.

The code `results = func_1(test_cases)` calls the function `func_1` with the argument `test_cases`. Since the function `func_1` is not defined, its exact behavior cannot be determined. However, it is implied that `func_1` processes the `test_cases` and returns some results. The variable `idx` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the only new variable introduced is `results`, which holds the return value from `func_1(test_cases)`.
