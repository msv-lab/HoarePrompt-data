Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters: an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5), an integer `x` (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), an integer `y` (1 ≤ y ≤ 10^9), and a list `arr` of `n` integers (1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n). It does not return anything explicitly mentioned in the given information.**

Based on the provided constraints and relationships, the function likely processes these parameters in some way, but the specific operation is not detailed here.
