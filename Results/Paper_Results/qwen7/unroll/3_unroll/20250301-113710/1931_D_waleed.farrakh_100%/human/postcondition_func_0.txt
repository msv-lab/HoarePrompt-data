The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples `test_cases` as input. Each tuple contains the length of an array `n`, two integers `x` and `y` representing Polycarp's favorite numbers, and an array `arr` of integers. For each test case, the function calculates the count of unique pairs `(rx, ry)` that appear in the array `arr`, where `rx` is computed as `(-a % x + x) % x` and `ry` as `a % y`. It then appends this count to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function returns the list `results`.
