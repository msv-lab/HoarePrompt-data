### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program step-by-step to ensure its correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `freq` is a dictionary to store the frequency of pairs `(rx, ry)`.
   - `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - Calculate `rx` as `(-a % x + x) % x`. This ensures `rx` is always non-negative and less than `x`.
     - Calculate `ry` as `a % y`.
     - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`. If it does, add the frequency of this pair to `count`.
     - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return the count**:
   - After processing all elements in the array, append the count to the results list and return the results list.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Read the input from standard input and split it into lines.
   - Parse the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, parse `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Append the parsed test case to `test_cases`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Call `func_1` with the `test_cases` list.
   - Print the results for each test case.

#### Annotations:
- The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at key points, ensuring that the program follows the intended logic.
- The calculations for `rx` and `ry` are correct and handle negative remainders appropriately.
- The use of a frequency dictionary to count pairs is sound and ensures that all beautiful pairs are correctly identified.

#### Example Verification:
Let's verify the example provided in the problem statement:

- **Input**:
  ```
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```

- **Expected Output**: `2`

- **Execution**:
  - For `a = 1`:
    - `rx = (-1 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 4`
    - `ry = 1 % 2 = 1`
    - No previous pair found, so `freq[(4, 1)] = 1`.
  - For `a = 2`:
    - `rx = (-2 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 3`
    - `ry = 2 % 2 = 0`
    - No previous pair found, so `freq[(3, 0)] = 1`.
  - For `a = 7`:
    - `rx = (-7 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 3`
    - `ry = 7 % 2 = 1`
    - No previous pair found, so `freq[(3, 1)] = 1`.
  - For `a = 4`:
    - `rx = (-4 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 1`
    - `ry = 4 % 2 = 0`
    - No previous pair found, so `freq[(1, 0)] = 1`.
  - For `a = 9`:
    - `rx = (-9 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 1`
    - `ry = 9 % 2 = 1`
    - Pair `(1, 1)` found once before, so `count += 1`.
  - For `a = 6`:
    - `rx = (-6 % 5 + 5) % 5 = 4`
    - `ry = 6 % 2 = 0`
    - Pair `(4, 0)` found once before, so `count += 1`.

Thus, the count of beautiful pairs is `2`, which matches the expected output.

Given the thorough analysis and the correct implementation of the logic, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final:
**True**
