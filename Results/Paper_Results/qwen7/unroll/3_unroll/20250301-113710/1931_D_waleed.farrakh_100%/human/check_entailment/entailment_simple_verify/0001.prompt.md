You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the provided Python program to determine if it correctly implements the logic for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of the occurrences of pairs `(a % x, a % y)` and a counter `count` to accumulate the number of beautiful pairs.
   - For each element `a` in the array:
     - It calculates `rx` and `ry` using modulo operations.
     - If the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count from `freq` to `count`.
     - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr` from the input data.
   - It appends the test case details to `test_cases`.
   - It calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and prints the results.

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
   - The use of `a % y` directly calculates `ry`.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - The pair `(rx, ry)` is used to check if there are any previous occurrences of such pairs in the array.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it means there was a previous element that could form a beautiful pair with the current element.

3. **Frequency Update**:
   - The frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in `freq` to ensure that future checks are accurate.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Conclusion:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
