Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n; `input` is set to `sys.stdin.read`**.

The code replaces the default input function with `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string. However, it does not assign this string to any variable or alter the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial conditions.
