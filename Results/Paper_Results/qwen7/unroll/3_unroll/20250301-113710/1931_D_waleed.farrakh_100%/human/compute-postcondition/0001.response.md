Output State: **`data` is a list containing the lines from `input().splitlines()`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5, `x` and `y` are integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9, and `arr` is a list of n integers such that 1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9 for all 0 ≤ i < n.**

The code `data = input().splitlines()` reads the entire input using `sys.stdin.read`, splits it into lines, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `data`. The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged from their initial state.
