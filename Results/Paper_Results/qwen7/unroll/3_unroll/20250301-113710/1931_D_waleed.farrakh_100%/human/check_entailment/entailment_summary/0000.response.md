Reasoning:
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem as described. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Understanding `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It splits the input into lines and extracts the necessary parameters for each test case.
   - It then calls `func_1` to process each test case and prints the results.

2. **Understanding `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` takes a list of test cases as input.
   - For each test case, it calculates the count of beautiful pairs using the given conditions.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of pairs `(rx, ry)` where `rx = (-a % x + x) % x` and `ry = a % y`.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` is found in the frequency dictionary, it increments the count by the frequency of that pair.
   - Finally, it appends the count to the results list and returns it.

3. **Verification:**
   - `func_2` correctly reads the input and organizes it into test cases.
   - `func_1` correctly identifies and counts the beautiful pairs according to the given conditions.
   - Both functions together handle multiple test cases and produce the correct output.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the logic implemented in both functions, they collectively meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
