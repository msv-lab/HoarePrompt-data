test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n (an integer representing the length of the array), x and y (two integers representing Polycarp's favorite integers), and arr (a list of n integers representing the elements of the array). Each element in arr is an integer between 1 and 10^9 inclusive.
