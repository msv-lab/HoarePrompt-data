Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` to compute the number of beautiful pairs for each test case.
- `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs based on the given conditions:
  - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of previously seen pairs `(rx, ry)`.
  - `rx` is calculated as `(-a % x + x) % x` to ensure non-negative remainders.
  - `ry` is calculated as `a % y`.
  - For each element in the array, it checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` has been seen before and increments the count accordingly.
- The overall logic in both functions aligns with the problem statement and the provided examples.
- There are no logical errors or missing steps in the implementation.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
