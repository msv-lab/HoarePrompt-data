Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

#### Function `func_1`
This function processes each test case and calculates the number of beautiful pairs.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` list to store the results for each test case.
   - `freq` dictionary to keep track of the frequency of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs.
   - `count` to accumulate the number of beautiful pairs.

2. **Loop through the array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, compute `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures `rx` is non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This computes the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - Check if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`:
     - If it does, add the count of such pairs to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

3. **Return the results**:
   - Append the `count` to the `results` list for each test case.

#### Function `func_2`
This function reads the input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` to get the results.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads the entire input into a list of lines.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`.
   - Loops through each test case to extract `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the list of test cases.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

### Verification

To verify the correctness, we need to ensure that:
1. The logic for calculating `rx` and `ry` is correct.
2. The frequency counting and pair checking logic is accurate.
3. The input reading and processing logic in `func_2` is correct.

#### Checking the Logic

1. **Calculation of `rx`**:
   - The formula `(-a % x + x) % x` correctly handles negative remainders, ensuring `rx` is always non-negative.

2. **Pair Checking**:
   - The logic checks if `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq` and updates the count accordingly.
   - This ensures that pairs `(i, j)` where `a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y` are correctly counted.

3. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The frequency of pairs is updated correctly, ensuring that duplicate pairs are counted accurately.

4. **Input Reading and Processing**:
   - The input is read correctly and processed in chunks, ensuring that multiple test cases are handled efficiently.

### Conclusion

After analyzing the code, it appears that the logic is correct and follows the problem statement accurately. The functions handle the input, process the test cases, and calculate the number of beautiful pairs correctly.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
