You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has two favorite integers x and y (they can be equal), and he has
found an array a of length n .

Polycarp considers a pair of indices \langle i, j \rangle (1 \le i < j \le n )
beautiful if:

  * a_i + a_j is divisible by x ; 
  * a_i - a_j is divisible by y . 

For example, if x=5 , y=2 , n=6 , a= [1, 2, 7, 4, 9, 6 ], then the only
beautiful pairs are:

  * \langle 1, 5 \rangle : a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8 (-8 is divisible by 2 ); 
  * \langle 4, 6 \rangle : a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10 (10 is divisible by 5 ) and a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2 (-2 is divisible by 2 ). 

Find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , x , and y (2 \le
n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x, y \le 10^9 ) — the size of the array and
Polycarp's favorite integers.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the elements of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of beautiful pairs in
the array a .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. Let's break down the solution:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It iterates through each element in the array and calculates the remainders when divided by `x` and `y`.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary to keep track of how many times each pair of remainders has been seen.
   - For each element, it checks if the pair of remainders has been seen before and increments the count accordingly.
   - This ensures that all pairs `(i, j)` where `1 <= i < j <= n` and both conditions (`a_i + a_j` is divisible by `x` and `a_i - a_j` is divisible by `y`) are met are counted.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - It reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - The results are printed out for each test case.

Given the problem description and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all potential cases. Here’s a quick verification using the example provided in the problem statement:

- For the input:
  ```
  6 5 2
  1 2 7 4 9 6
  ```
  The beautiful pairs are:
  - `<1, 5>`: `a_1 + a_5 = 1 + 9 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_1 - a_5 = 1 - 9 = -8` (divisible by 2).
  - `<4, 6>`: `a_4 + a_6 = 4 + 6 = 10` (divisible by 5) and `a_4 - a_6 = 4 - 6 = -2` (divisible by 2).

  The program correctly counts these pairs and outputs `2`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic and handles all edge cases, the correctness is **True**.
