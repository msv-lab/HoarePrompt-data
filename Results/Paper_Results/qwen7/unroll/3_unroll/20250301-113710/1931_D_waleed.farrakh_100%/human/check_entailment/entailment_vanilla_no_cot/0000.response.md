To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze both `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's break it down step-by-step.

### Analysis of `func_1`

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list `results` to store the counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.
2. **Loop through Test Cases**: For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of occurrences of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs and a counter `count` to accumulate the number of beautiful pairs.
3. **Calculate Remainders**: For each element `a` in the array, it calculates the remainders `rx` and `ry` when `a` is divided by `x` and `y`, respectively.
4. **Check Frequency**: If the tuple `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it adds the count from `freq` to `count`.
5. **Update Frequency Dictionary**: It updates the frequency dictionary with the current pair `(a % x, a % y)`.
6. **Store Result**: After processing all elements in the array, it appends the count to `results`.

### Analysis of `func_2`

1. **Reading Input**: The function reads the entire input from stdin and splits it into lines.
2. **Extract Test Cases**: It extracts the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
3. **Call `func_1`**: It calls `func_1` with the list of test cases and stores the results.
4. **Print Results**: It prints the results for each test case.

### Correctness Check

1. **Remainder Calculation**: The calculation of remainders `rx` and `ry` is correct.
2. **Frequency Tracking**: The use of a frequency dictionary to track occurrences of `(a % x, a % y)` pairs is correct.
3. **Counting Beautiful Pairs**: The logic to count beautiful pairs is correct.
4. **Input Reading**: The way `func_2` reads the input and processes it is correct.

Given the detailed analysis, the provided program appears to correctly implement the solution for finding the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

### Conclusion

The correctness of the program is verified to be **True**.

**Correctness: True**
