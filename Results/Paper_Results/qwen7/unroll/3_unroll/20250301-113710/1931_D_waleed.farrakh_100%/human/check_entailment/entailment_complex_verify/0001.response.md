### Reasoning:

The original assessment accurately describes the logic and functionality of the provided Python program. Let's break down the key points to confirm the correctness:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function iterates through each element in the array and calculates `rx` and `ry` using the specified modulo operations.
   - It uses a frequency dictionary `freq` to keep track of previously seen pairs `(rx, ry)`.
   - For each element, it checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` already exists in `freq` and increments the count accordingly.
   - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function reads the input from standard input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It constructs the `test_cases` list by reading the necessary parameters and the array for each test case.
   - It calls `func_1` with the constructed `test_cases` and prints the results.

### Verification of Logic:

1. **Modulo Operations**:
   - The use of `(-a % x + x) % x` ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
   - The use of `a % y` directly calculates `ry`.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - The pair `(rx, ry)` is used to check if there are any previous occurrences of such pairs in the array.
   - If a pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq`, it means there was a previous element that could form a beautiful pair with the current element.

3. **Frequency Update**:
   - The frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` is updated in `freq` to ensure that future checks are accurate.

4. **Output**:
   - The results are printed correctly after processing all test cases.

### Detailed Analysis Using Annotations:

- **Initial State**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples containing `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
- **Function `func_1`**:
  - For each test case, it initializes a frequency dictionary `freq` and a counter `count`.
  - It iterates through each element `a` in the array and calculates `rx` and `ry`.
  - It checks if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in `freq` and updates the count accordingly.
  - It updates the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in `freq`.
  - Finally, it appends the count to the results list.
- **Function `func_2`**:
  - Reads the input from standard input and constructs the `test_cases` list.
  - Calls `func_1` with `test_cases` and prints the results.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given problem description. The annotations support the original assessment, confirming that the program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Final: **True**
