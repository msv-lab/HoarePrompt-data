### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided program step-by-step to verify its correctness based on the problem description and the function summaries.

#### Function `func_1`:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `results` is initialized as an empty list to store the results for each test case.
   - `freq` is a dictionary used to keep track of the frequency of remainders `(a % x, a % y)`.

2. **Iterating Through Array**:
   - For each element `a` in the array, calculate the remainders `rx` and `ry`:
     - `rx = (-a % x + x) % x`: This ensures that `rx` is always non-negative.
     - `ry = a % y`: This directly calculates the remainder when `a` is divided by `y`.
   - Check if the pair `(rx, ry)` exists in the `freq` dictionary:
     - If it exists, add the count of this pair to `count`.
   - Update the frequency of the current pair `(a % x, a % y)` in the `freq` dictionary.

3. **Returning Results**:
   - Append the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.
   - Return the `results` list after processing all test cases.

#### Function `func_2`:
1. **Reading Input**:
   - Reads input from stdin and splits it into lines.
   - Extracts the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, extracts `n`, `x`, `y`, and the array `arr`.
   - Appends the test case tuple `(n, x, y, arr)` to the `test_cases` list.

2. **Processing Test Cases**:
   - Calls `func_1` with the `test_cases` list.
   - Collects the results from `func_1`.
   - Prints the results for each test case.

#### Correctness Analysis:
1. **Remainder Calculation**:
   - The calculation of `rx` ensures that the remainder is always non-negative, which is crucial for the modulo operation.
   - The calculation of `ry` is straightforward and correct.

2. **Frequency Dictionary**:
   - The use of a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of remainders is correct and efficient.
   - The logic for updating and checking the frequency dictionary is sound.

3. **Pair Checking**:
   - The logic for checking if a pair `(i, j)` is beautiful is correct:
     - `a_i + a_j` must be divisible by `x`.
     - `a_i - a_j` must be divisible by `y`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge cases where `x` and `y` can be large and the array can have up to `2 \cdot 10^5` elements.
   - The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results for each.

Given the detailed analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The provided examples and the function summaries support this conclusion.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.
