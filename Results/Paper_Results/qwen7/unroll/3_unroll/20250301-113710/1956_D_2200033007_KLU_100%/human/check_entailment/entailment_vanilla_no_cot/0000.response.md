Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided solution does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be attempting to solve a different problem related to maximizing the sum of a subarray using a recursive approach, but they do not align with the problem statement. Specifically:

1. **Incorrect Approach**: The problem requires setting all elements within a chosen subarray to the MEX value of that subarray. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not appear to be solving this problem. Instead, they seem to be trying to find some kind of maximum subarray sum, which is not relevant to the MEX operation.

2. **Lack of MEX Calculation**: There is no implementation of the MEX calculation within the provided functions. The MEX of a set of integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, which is crucial for solving the problem.

3. **No Direct Solution**: The solution does not provide a direct way to maximize the sum of the array by setting subarrays to their respective MEX values. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` do not address how to choose the optimal subarrays to maximize the sum.

To correctly solve the problem, one would need to:
- Implement a function to calculate the MEX of a subarray.
- Use a dynamic programming or greedy approach to decide which subarrays to modify to maximize the sum.
- Ensure that the operations are performed no more than \(5 \times 10^5\) times.

Given these issues, the provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem, hence the correctness is False.
