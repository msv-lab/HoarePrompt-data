Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem. The functions `func_1`, `func_2`, and `make_stairs` do not seem to address the core requirement of maximizing the sum of the array elements through the specified operations. Instead, they appear to be implementing a dynamic programming approach to solve a different problem, possibly related to finding the maximum subarray sum, which is not aligned with the problem description.

The problem requires using the MEX (Minimum Excludant) operation to maximize the sum of the array elements, but the provided functions do not include any logic for calculating MEX or updating the array elements accordingly. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
