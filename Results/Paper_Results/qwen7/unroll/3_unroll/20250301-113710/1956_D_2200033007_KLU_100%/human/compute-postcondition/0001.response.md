State: **`is_already_stairs` is True, `j` is 0, `i` must be greater than 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop head contains the variables `j` and `i`.
2. The loop `for j in range(i + 1):` will start executing if `i + 1` is greater than 0 (since `range(n)` generates numbers from 0 to `n-1`).
3. Before the loop starts, `is_already_stairs` being `True` does not directly affect the loop's execution, but we need to ensure `i` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
4. The variable `j` is initialized to 0 by the `range` function.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `i` is greater than 0 and `j` is 0.
