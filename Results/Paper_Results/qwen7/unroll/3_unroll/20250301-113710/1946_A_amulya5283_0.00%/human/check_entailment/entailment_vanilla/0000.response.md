Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself, storing them in a list of tuples.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It sorts the array to find the median.
   - It calculates the median index correctly, considering both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - It uses a min-heap to efficiently find the minimum element that needs to be incremented to increase the median.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program initializes a heap with elements from the median index onwards.
   - It repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it, and pushes it back until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
   - This ensures that the minimum number of operations is performed to increase the median.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles arrays of different sizes and values within the specified range.
   - It correctly identifies the need for increment operations and the minimum number of such operations.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case correctly.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Correctness: **True**
