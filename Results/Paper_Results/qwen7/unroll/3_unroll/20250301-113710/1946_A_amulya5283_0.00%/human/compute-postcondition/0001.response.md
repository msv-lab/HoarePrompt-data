State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a`, `i` is 0**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head includes the variable `i` and the integer `t`.
2. **Determine Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `t`. Therefore, `t` must be a positive integer for the loop to execute at least once.
3. **Initial Values**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be set to 0 because the loop starts from the first iteration.
4. **Other Variables**: The variable `results` and the list `test_cases` do not affect the loop's ability to execute and thus do not need to be adjusted.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `t` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
