### Reasoning:

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads the input from standard input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into individual components.
   - It iterates through each test case, reading the size of the array and the array itself, storing them in a list of tuples.
   - This part is correct and well-implemented.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function processes each test case.
   - It sorts the array to find the median.
   - It calculates the median index correctly, considering both even and odd lengths of the array.
   - However, there is a critical flaw in how the median is being handled and the heap operations.

3. **Heap Operations**:
   - The program initializes a heap with elements from the median index onwards.
   - It repeatedly pops the smallest element from the heap, increments it, and pushes it back until the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
   - This approach is flawed because:
     - The heap only contains elements from the median index onwards, which means it does not consider the entire array when determining the median.
     - The median of the entire array is needed, not just the elements from the median index onwards.
     - The heap operations do not correctly reflect the median of the entire array.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the array has duplicate elements or when the array is already sorted.
   - For example, in the case where the array is already sorted, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of operations needed to increase the median.

5. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case, but the results are incorrect due to the flawed logic in the heap operations.

### Detailed Analysis:

- **Median Calculation**:
  - The median is calculated correctly by sorting the array and finding the middle element.
  - However, the heap is only initialized with elements from the median index onwards, which means it does not reflect the true median of the entire array.

- **Heap Initialization**:
  - `heap = arr[median_index:]` initializes the heap with elements from the median index onwards, which is incorrect.

- **Heap Operations**:
  - The loop `while heap[0] <= current_median:` ensures that the smallest element in the heap is greater than the current median.
  - However, since the heap only contains elements from the median index onwards, it does not reflect the true median of the entire array.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment is inaccurate because the program does not correctly handle the median calculation and the heap operations. The heap only considers elements from the median index onwards, which does not reflect the true median of the entire array.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
