Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `t`, a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases`, a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) and a list of `n` integers `a` (the array `a`). The function returns a list named 'results', where each element corresponds to the number of operations required to ensure that all elements in the second half of each array are greater than the median of the array after sorting.**
