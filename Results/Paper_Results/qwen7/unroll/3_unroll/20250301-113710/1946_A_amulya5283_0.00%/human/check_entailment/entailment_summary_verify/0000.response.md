### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program and the function summary step-by-step to determine its correctness.

#### Problem Analysis:
- We need to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array.
- An operation consists of incrementing any element in the array by 1.
- The median is defined as the middle element in the sorted array if the number of elements is odd, or the average of the two middle elements if the number of elements is even.

#### Given Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads input from stdin and processes multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case.
   
2. **Processing Each Test Case:**
   - For each test case, it sorts the array.
   - It identifies the median index.
   - It creates a min-heap from the elements after the median index.
   - It increments the smallest element in the heap until all elements in the heap are greater than the current median.
   - It counts the number of operations performed.

#### Function Summary Analysis:
- The function `func_1` processes each test case by sorting the array, identifying the median, and using a min-heap to ensure all elements after the median are incremented to be greater than the median.
- This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations because it only focuses on the elements after the median index without considering the possibility of incrementing other elements to achieve the goal with fewer operations.

#### Example Analysis:
- Consider the test case: `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - Median: `2`.
  - Incrementing the middle element `2` to `3` requires 1 operation.
  - However, the program's approach does not consider this possibility and instead creates a heap from `[3]` and finds that no operations are needed, which is incorrect.

#### Correct Approach:
- To find the minimum number of operations, we should consider the difference between the median and the smallest element in the array.
- If the smallest element is less than the median, we need to increment it to be equal to or greater than the median.
- We should also consider the possibility of incrementing other elements to achieve the goal with fewer operations.

Given the analysis, the provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The approach of using a min-heap to ensure all elements after the median are greater than the median is not optimal and does not guarantee the minimum number of operations.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not guarantee the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
