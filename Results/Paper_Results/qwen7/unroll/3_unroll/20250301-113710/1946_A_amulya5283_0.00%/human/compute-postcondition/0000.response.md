Output State: **`results` is an empty list, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, and `test_cases` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains an integer `n` (the length of the array `a`) and a list of `n` integers `a` (the array `a`).**

The code initializes an empty list named `results`. No changes are made to the values of `t` or `test_cases`, so they remain as described in the initial state.
