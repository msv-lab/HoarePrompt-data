Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the program uses a min-heap to find the minimum number of operations needed to make the median greater than the current median. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations in all cases.

Consider the following test case:
```
3
1 2 3
```
The median of the array `[1, 2, 3]` is `2`. To increase the median, we can simply increment the middle element `2` to `3`, which requires only 1 operation. However, the program would incorrectly calculate the number of operations as follows:

1. Sort the array: `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. Identify the median index: `1` (since `n=3`, the median index is `1`).
3. Current median: `2`.
4. Create a heap from the elements after the median index: `[3]`.
5. Since the heap's root (`3`) is already greater than the current median (`2`), no operations are needed.

This example shows that the program does not correctly handle cases where incrementing a different element could achieve the goal with fewer operations. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
