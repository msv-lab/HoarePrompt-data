Output State: **`output1` contains all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` in reverse order; `output2` contains the corresponding quotient divisors for each divisor in `output1`.**

Explanation: The code `output1.reverse()` reverses the list `output1` in place. This means that while the original content of `output1` remains the same (containing all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x`), the order of elements in `output1` is now reversed. The variable `output2` remains unchanged, still containing the corresponding quotient divisors for each divisor in the now-reversed `output1`.
