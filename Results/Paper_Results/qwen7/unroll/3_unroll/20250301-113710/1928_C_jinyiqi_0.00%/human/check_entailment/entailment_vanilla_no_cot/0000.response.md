Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The given program has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sep`**: 
   - The function `func_1` returns a list of divisors of `(n + x - 2)` and `(n - x)`. However, the logic to determine if a divisor `s` can be a valid `k` is flawed. Specifically, the condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be checked against `x`, but the current implementation checks against `s`.

2. **Redundant Logic**:
   - The logic for checking if a divisor `s` can be a valid `k` is not correctly implemented. The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` should be checked to ensure that the value derived from `s` is greater than or equal to `x`.

3. **Set Conversion**:
   - The use of `list(set(output))` at the end is unnecessary and may cause loss of information since the set operation removes duplicates, which might be important in this context.

4. **Function Naming**:
   - The function `func_1` is used to find divisors, but its name is misleading. A better name would be something like `find_divisors`.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
t = int(input())
for i in range(t):
    (n, x) = map(int, input().split())
    output = []
    
    # Check for (n + x - 2)
    if (n + x - 2) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n + x - 2)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) // 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) // 2)
                
    # Check for (n - x)
    if (n - x) % 2 == 0:
        sep = func_1(n - x)
        for s in sep:
            if (s + 2) % 2 == 0 and (s + 2) // 2 >= x:
                output.append((s + 2) // 2)
                
    print(len(set(output)))

def func_1(x):
    output = []
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            output.append(i)
            output.append(int(x / i))
    return output
```

This corrected version ensures that the logic for determining valid `k` values is correct and avoids unnecessary operations.
