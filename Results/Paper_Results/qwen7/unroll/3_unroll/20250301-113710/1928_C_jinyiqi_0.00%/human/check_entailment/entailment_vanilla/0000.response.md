Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - An empty list `output` is initialized to store possible values of `k`.

3. **Condition 1:**
   - If `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n + x - 2)` to get the divisors of `n + x - 2`.
   - It iterates over these divisors and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to `output`.

4. **Condition 2:**
   - If `(n - x) % 2 == 0`, it calls `func_1(n - x)` to get the divisors of `n - x`.
   - It iterates over these divisors and checks if `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` and `(s + 2) / 2 >= x`.
   - If both conditions are met, it appends `(s + 2) / 2` to `output`.

5. **Removing Duplicates:**
   - The `output` list is converted to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.

6. **Function `func_1`:**
   - This function finds all divisors of a given number `x`.
   - It uses a loop to find divisors up to the square root of `x` and includes both the divisor and its complement.
   - The divisors are returned in reverse order.

### Correctness Analysis:

1. **Divisor Calculation:**
   - The `func_1` function correctly calculates all divisors of a given number `x`.

2. **Condition Checking:**
   - The conditions `(n + x - 2) % 2 == 0` and `(n - x) % 2 == 0` ensure that the settling pattern length (2k - 2) is even.
   - The condition `(s + 2) % 2 == 0` ensures that `k` is an integer.
   - The condition `(s + 2) / 2 >= x` ensures that the position `x` fits within the settling pattern.

3. **Handling Duplicates:**
   - Using a set to remove duplicates before converting back to a list ensures that each valid `k` is counted only once.

### Conclusion:

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of valid `k` values for each test case based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Correctness: **True**
