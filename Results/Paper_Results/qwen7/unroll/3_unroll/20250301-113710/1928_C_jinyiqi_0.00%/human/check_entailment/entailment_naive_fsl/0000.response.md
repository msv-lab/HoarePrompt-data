Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where `x` is greater than `n`. Specifically, in the second test case `(3, 1)`, the program should return `1` because `k = 2` is the only valid value. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this scenario. The logic in the program checks conditions that do not fully cover the problem requirements, leading to incorrect results in certain cases.
