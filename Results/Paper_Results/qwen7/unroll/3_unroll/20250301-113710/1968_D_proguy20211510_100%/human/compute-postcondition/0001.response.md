Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers of length n, MOD is 1000000007, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**

Explanation: The code initializes the variable `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 7`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, so their states remain unchanged. The output state includes all the variables from the initial state along with the newly defined `MOD` variable.
