You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bodya and Sasha found a permutation p_1,\dots,p_n and an array a_1,\dots,a_n .
They decided to play a well-known "Permutation game".

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but
[1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is
also not a permutation (n=3 but there is 4 in the array).

Both of them chose a starting position in the permutation.

The game lasts k turns. The players make moves simultaneously. On each turn,
two things happen to each player:

  * If the current position of the player is x , his score increases by a_x . 
  * Then the player either stays at his current position x or moves from x to p_x . 

The winner of the game is the player with the higher score after exactly k
turns.

Knowing Bodya's starting position P_B and Sasha's starting position P_S ,
determine who wins the game if both players are trying to win.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
testcases.

The first line of each testcase contains integers n , k , P_B , P_S (1\le
P_B,P_S\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5 , 1\le k\le 10^9 ) — length of the permutation,
duration of the game, starting positions respectively.

The next line contains n integers p_1,\dots,p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ) — elements
of the permutation p .

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (1\le a_i\le 10^9 ) — elements
of array a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values of n over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each testcase output:

  * "Bodya" if Bodya wins the game. 
  * "Sasha" if Sasha wins the game. 
  * "Draw" if the players have the same score.

Note

Below you can find the explanation for the first testcase, where the game
consists of k=2 turns.

Turn| Bodya's position| Bodya's score| Bodya's move| Sasha's position| Sasha's
score| Sasha's move  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
first| 3 | 0 + a_3 = 0 + 5 = 5 | stays on the same position| 2 | 0 + a_2 = 0 + 2 = 2 | moves to p_2=1   
second| 3 | 5 + a_3 = 5 + 5 = 10 | stays on the same position| 1 | 2 + a_1 = 2 + 7 = 9 | stays on the same position  
final results| 3 | 10 | | 1 | 9 |   
  
As we may see, Bodya's score is greater, so he wins the game. It can be shown
that Bodya always can win this game.

    #State: The output will be determined based on the maximum value between `resb` and `ress` for each iteration. If `resb` is greater than `ress`, "Bodya" will be printed; if `ress` is greater than `resb`, "Sasha" will be printed; otherwise, "Draw" will be printed. The specific values of `resb` and `ress` depend on the input values of `n`, `k`, `pb`, `ps`, `p`, and `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads integers n, k, P_B, and P_S, a permutation p, and an array a. It then determines two paths, one starting from P_B and the other from P_S, and calculates the maximum possible sum of k consecutive elements along each path. Based on which path has the higher sum, it prints either "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing**: The program correctly parses the input values for `n`, `k`, `pb`, and `ps` and converts them to integers.
2. **Permutation and Array Input**: The program correctly reads and stores the permutation `p` and the array `a`.
3. **Path Calculation for Bodya and Sasha**:
   - The program initializes two lists `pathb` and `paths` to store the scores for Bodya and Sasha, respectively.
   - It uses a `vis` list to keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.
   - For Bodya, it starts from `pb-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
   - Similarly, for Sasha, it starts from `ps-1` and follows the permutation until a cycle is detected.
4. **Score Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the maximum possible score for Bodya and Sasha using the formula `curr = preb + pathb[i] * (k - i)` and `pres + paths[i] * (k - i)`.
   - It updates the scores for Bodya and Sasha accordingly.
5. **Output Determination**:
   - After calculating the scores, the program compares them and prints the appropriate result: "Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw".

### Analysis:

- The logic for parsing and storing the permutation and array is correct.
- The path calculation for both players is implemented correctly.
- The score calculation logic is also correct, considering the remaining turns and the accumulated scores.
- The output determination is handled correctly based on the comparison of the final scores.

Given the problem constraints and the implementation details, the program appears to handle all aspects of the problem correctly.

### Conclusion:

**Correctness: **True**
