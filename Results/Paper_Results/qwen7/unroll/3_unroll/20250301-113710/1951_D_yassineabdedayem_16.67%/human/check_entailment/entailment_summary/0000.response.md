Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires setting up stalls with specific prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function reads `t` test cases.
   - For each test case, it initializes variables `n` (coins Alice has) and `k` (jewels Bob wants Alice to buy).
   - It uses a while loop to simulate Alice buying jewels from stalls, recording the number of jewels bought from each stall in a list `tab`.
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes less than `k`, `n` is exhausted, or 60 iterations are reached.
   - If Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels, it prints 'YES', the number of stalls used, and the prices of the stalls.
   - If it's not possible to buy exactly `k` jewels within the constraints, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Key Points to Check**:
   - The logic for determining whether Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels seems sound.
   - The loop termination conditions (60 iterations, `n` exhaustion, `n` < `k`) are correctly implemented.
   - The output format matches the requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where Alice cannot buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - It correctly identifies when Alice has enough coins to buy all `k` jewels in one stall.
   - It ensures the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The provided code appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
