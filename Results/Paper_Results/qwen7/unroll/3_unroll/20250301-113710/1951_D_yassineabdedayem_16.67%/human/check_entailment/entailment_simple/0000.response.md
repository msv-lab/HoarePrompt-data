Reasoning:

The annotated program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the test cases and determining whether Bob can set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels. Here's a detailed breakdown of the logic and its correctness:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then processes each test case by reading the values of `n` (number of coins) and `k` (number of jewels).

2. **Stall Setup Logic**:
   - The program uses a loop to simulate Alice buying jewels from stalls.
   - It calculates the minimum (`Min`) and maximum (`Max`) number of jewels Alice can buy from the current stall without exceeding her remaining coins or the desired number of jewels.
   - Depending on the conditions, it updates the number of jewels Alice buys (`number`), the remaining number of jewels (`k`), and the remaining coins (`n`).
   - It appends the number of jewels bought from the current stall to the list `tab`.

3. **Termination Conditions**:
   - The loop continues as long as `n` is not zero, `k` is greater than zero, the number of stalls (`rep`) is less than 60, and `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If `k` becomes zero, it means Alice has bought exactly `k` jewels, and the program prints "YES" followed by the number of stalls and the prices per jewel.
   - If any of the termination conditions are not met, it prints "NO".

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the edge case where `n` becomes zero before `k` reaches zero or the number of stalls reaches 60.
   - It ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60, which is a requirement of the problem.

Given the logic and the constraints, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the given problem. It checks all necessary conditions and outputs the correct result based on the input values.

Correctness: **True**
