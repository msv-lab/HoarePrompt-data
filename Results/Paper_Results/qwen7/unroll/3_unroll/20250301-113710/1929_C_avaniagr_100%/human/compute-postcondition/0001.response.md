Output State: The output state consists of a series of 'YES' and 'NO' based on the conditions evaluated within the loop for each iteration. For each line of input, the program checks the value of `x` relative to `k-1` and calculates `z` if necessary, then determines whether `a` is greater than or equal to `z` to decide the output ('YES' or 'NO'). The exact sequence of 'YES' and 'NO' depends on the specific values of `k`, `x`, and `a` for each iteration.
