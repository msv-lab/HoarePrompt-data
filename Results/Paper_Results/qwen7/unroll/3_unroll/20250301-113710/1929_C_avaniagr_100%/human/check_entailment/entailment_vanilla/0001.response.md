Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads from standard input using `[*open(0)][1:]`, which means it reads all lines except the first one. This is correct for reading multiple test cases.

2. **Parsing Input:**
   - It uses `map(int, s.split())` to parse each line into integers \( k \), \( x \), and \( a \). This is correct and matches the problem's input format.

3. **Condition Checking:**
   - The program checks different conditions based on the values of \( k \) and \( x \):

     - **Case 1:** \( x < k - 1 \)
       - If \( a \geq x + 1 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
       
     - **Case 2:** \( x == k - 1 \)
       - If \( a \geq x + 2 \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
       
     - **Case 3:** \( x > k - 1 \)
       - It calculates \( z \) using a loop where \( z \) is updated iteratively.
       - If \( a \geq z \), it prints 'YES'.
       - Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

4. **Calculation of \( z \):**
   - The calculation of \( z \) in the loop seems to be an attempt to ensure that Sasha can always win enough coins to cover the required number of consecutive losses. However, the logic here is flawed because it does not correctly simulate the betting strategy needed to guarantee winning any number of coins.

### Detailed Explanation of the Flaw

- **Incorrect Calculation of \( z \):**
  - The loop `z += z // (k - 1) + 1` does not accurately model the betting strategy. It assumes a fixed pattern of bets without considering the actual constraints and outcomes of the game.

- **Missing Strategy Simulation:**
  - The program does not simulate the actual betting process to ensure that Sasha can always win enough coins to reach any desired amount. Instead, it relies on a fixed threshold check, which is insufficient for the problem's requirements.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem. Specifically, the way \( z \) is calculated and the overall strategy for ensuring Sasha can always win any number of coins is flawed.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **False**
