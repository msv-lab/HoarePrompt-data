### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given annotated program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Reading and Parsing**:
   - The program reads input from standard input and processes each line containing integers `k`, `x`, and `a`.
   - It correctly parses these integers using `map(int, s.split())`.

2. **Conditions for `x < k - 1`**:
   - If `x < k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 1`. 
     - If true, it prints 'YES'.
     - If false, it prints 'NO'.
   - This condition ensures that Sasha can always recover from a single loss by placing a bet of `x + 1` coins, which guarantees him more coins than he lost.

3. **Condition for `x == k - 1`**:
   - If `x == k - 1`, the program checks if `a >= x + 2`.
     - If true, it prints 'YES'.
     - If false, it prints 'NO'.
   - This condition ensures that Sasha can recover from two consecutive losses by placing a bet of `x + 2` coins, which guarantees him more coins than he lost.

4. **Condition for `x > k - 1`**:
   - If `x > k - 1`, the program calculates `z` as follows:
     - `z = k - 2`
     - For each iteration from `0` to `x - k + 2`, it updates `z` using the formula `z += z // (k - 1) + 1`.
   - The final value of `z` is compared with `a`:
     - If `a >= z`, it prints 'YES'.
     - If `a < z`, it prints 'NO'.
   - This condition ensures that Sasha can recover from a sequence of losses by strategically increasing his bet size.

5. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - The strategy described in the problem statement aligns with the logic implemented in the program.
   - The program correctly handles all possible scenarios based on the given constraints.

### Conclusion:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to determine if Sasha can achieve any number of coins based on the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
