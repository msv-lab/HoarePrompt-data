Output State: **`s` is 0, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive, `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5, `arr` is an empty list, `N` is an integer input from stdin, `nums` is a list of integers obtained from input split and mapped to integers, `e` is 0, `num` is the first element of `nums`, `nums` is now `[num, -1]`**.

The code appends `-1` to the `nums` list, changing its content from a list containing only the first element of the original `nums` list to a list containing that element followed by `-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
