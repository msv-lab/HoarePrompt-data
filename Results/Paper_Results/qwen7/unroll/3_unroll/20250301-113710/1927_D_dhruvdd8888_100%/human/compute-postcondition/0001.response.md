Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5; `a` is a list of n integers where each element is an integer between 1 and 10^6 inclusive; `q` is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5; each query is represented by two integers `l` and `r` such that 1 <= l < r <= n; `N` is an integer input from stdin.**

The code `N = int(input())` reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable `N`. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.
