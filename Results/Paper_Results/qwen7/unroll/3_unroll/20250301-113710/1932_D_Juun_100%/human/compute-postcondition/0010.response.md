Output State: `trumps` is an empty list, `t` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit remains the input string from `input()`, `answers` is a list containing strings where each string represents a pair of ranks and suits that were compared, `suits` is a dictionary with keys 'C', 'D', 'H', 'S' and corresponding values all set to None. If any rank in `trumps` was used in the comparisons, it has been popped from the list, and for each non-None value in `suits`, a corresponding entry was added to `answers`. If `trumps` was empty for any suit, 'IMPOSSIBLE' was printed and the function returned early.
