Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input string from `input()`, and the description of 2n cards consists of 2n two-character strings where the first character is one of "23456789" and the second character is one of "CDHS".**

In this output state, the variable `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 100, the variable `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 16, the trump suit is updated to the string input by the user through `input()`, and the description of the cards remains as initially described.
