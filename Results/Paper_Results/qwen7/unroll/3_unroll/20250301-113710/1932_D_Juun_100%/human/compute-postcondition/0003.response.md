Output State: **`trumps` is an empty list, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 16, the trump suit is the input string from `input()`, `answers` is an empty list.**

Explanation: The code initializes an empty list `answers`. The values of `trumps`, `t`, `n`, and the trump suit remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new fact that `answers` is now an empty list.
