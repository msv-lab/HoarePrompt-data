State before the loop starts: `testcases` is the result of `func_3()` call, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}, `d` is a list of m integers where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9, `f` is a list of k integers where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.

For the loop to execute, the key variable in the loop head is `testcases`. The loop will execute as long as `testcases` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to ensure that `testcases` is greater than 0.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `d`, `f`) are not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute; they are used within the loop body. Thus, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`testcases` must be greater than 0**
