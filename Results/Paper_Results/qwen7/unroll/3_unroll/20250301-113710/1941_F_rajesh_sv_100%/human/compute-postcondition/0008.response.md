Output State: **`A` is the return value of `func_4()`, `D` is a sorted list of unique elements returned by `func_4()`, `F` is the return value of `func_4()`, `max_diff` is the maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `next_max_diff` is the second maximum difference found between consecutive elements in `A`, `index` is the index of the first element involved in the maximum difference, `left` is `A[index - 1]`, `right` is `A[index]`.**

Explanation: The code assigns the value of `A[index - 1]` to `left` and the value of `A[index]` to `right`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, `left` and `right` are updated with the values from `A` at the specified indices, while `A`, `D`, `F`, `max_diff`, `next_max_diff`, and `index` retain their original values.
