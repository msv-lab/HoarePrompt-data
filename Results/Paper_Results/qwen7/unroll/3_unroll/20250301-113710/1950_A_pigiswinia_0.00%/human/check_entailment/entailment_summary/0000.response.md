Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
3. The program checks the conditions for a stair (`a < b < c`) and a peak (`a < b > c`).
4. If the condition for a stair is met, it prints "STAIRS".
5. If the condition for a peak is met, it prints "PEAK".
6. If neither condition is met, it prints "NONE".

The provided code matches the problem description and the example inputs and outputs perfectly. There are no logical errors or missing parts in the implementation.

Correctness: **True**
