Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, w is an integer representing the number of iterations of the loop, each iteration processes two lines of input where the first line is an integer `ln` and the second line is a space-separated list of integers `palka`, and the final output is the sum of the maximum number of groups of three occurrences of each unique integer in `palka` across all iterations.
