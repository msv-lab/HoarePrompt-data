Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads an integer `w` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `ln` representing the number of sticks.
   - It then reads a list of stick lengths `palka`.

2. **Data Structures:**
   - A dictionary `d` is used to count the occurrences of each stick length.
   - A list `pl` is used to store unique stick lengths.

3. **Counting Stick Lengths:**
   - The program iterates through each stick length in `palka`.
   - It updates the dictionary `d` to count how many times each stick length appears.
   - It also ensures that each unique stick length is added to the list `pl`.

4. **Calculating the Number of Polygons:**
   - The program initializes a counter `shapes` to zero.
   - It then iterates through each unique stick length in `pl`.
   - For each unique stick length `j`, it checks if the count of that stick length (`d[j]`) is at least 3.
   - If so, it adds the integer division of `d[j]` by 3 to `shapes`.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the value of `shapes` for each test case.

### Correctness Check

#### Test Case 1:
- Input: `1`
- Input: `1`
- Input: `1`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: There is only one stick, so no polygons can be formed.
- Program Output: `0`

#### Test Case 2:
- Input: `2`
- Input: `1`
- Input: `1 1`
- Expected Output: `0`
- Explanation: There are two sticks, but they are not enough to form any polygon.
- Program Output: `0`

#### Test Case 3:
- Input: `6`
- Input: `2`
- Input: `2 2 3 3 3 3`
- Expected Output: `1`
- Explanation: There are four sticks of length 3, which can form one square.
- Program Output: `1`

#### Test Case 4:
- Input: `9`
- Input: `4`
- Input: `4 2 2 2 2 4 2 4 4`
- Expected Output: `2`
- Explanation: There are four sticks of length 2, which can form one square, and six sticks of length 4, which can form one pentagon.
- Program Output: `2`

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum number of regular polygons that can be formed from the given sticks. It handles all the test cases provided in the example correctly.

### Final Answer
Correctness: **True**
