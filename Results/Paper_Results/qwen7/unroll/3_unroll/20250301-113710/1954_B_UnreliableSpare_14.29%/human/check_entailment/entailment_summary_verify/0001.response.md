### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The given solution checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - It also calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This helps in determining the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the array is uniform.
   - However, there is a logical flaw in the way it calculates the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition. Specifically, the current implementation only considers the first element (`val`) and does not account for the possibility of breaking the beauty condition by removing elements from other parts of the array.

5. **Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is partially correct but incomplete. It only considers the first element and does not handle the general case where the array might contain multiple sequences of identical elements.
   - For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The current implementation would incorrectly identify the minimum number of removals as 1, but the correct answer is 1 (removing the middle '2' breaks the beauty condition).

6. **Correctness**:
   - The solution correctly identifies whether the array is uniform.
   - However, it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition in all cases. The logic is flawed and does not account for the general structure of the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect based on the problem description due to the logical flaw in calculating the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

**Final: False**
