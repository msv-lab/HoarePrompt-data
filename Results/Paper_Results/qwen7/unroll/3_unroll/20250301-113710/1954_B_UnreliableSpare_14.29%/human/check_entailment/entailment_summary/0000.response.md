Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Logic Analysis**:
   - The function first checks if the array is uniform (all elements are the same). This is done using a flag which is set to `False` if any element differs from its predecessor.
   - If the array is uniform, the function correctly prints `-1`.
   - If the array is not uniform, the function aims to find the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements. However, the logic to achieve this is flawed.

2. **Flawed Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The variable `cnt` is used to count the number of consecutive identical elements starting from `arr[0]`.
   - The variable `ans` is initialized to infinity (`Decimal('Infinity')`) but is never updated properly to reflect the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements.
   - The loop iterates through the array, updating `cnt` when encountering identical elements and resetting it when encountering a different element. However, `ans` is only updated with `cnt` at the end of the loop, which means it might not capture the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements.

3. **Correct Approach**:
   - To correctly find the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements, one should keep track of the lengths of sequences of identical elements and update the minimum length accordingly.
   - A better approach would be to use two pointers or a sliding window technique to efficiently find the minimum length of the longest sequence of identical elements.

Given the above analysis, the current implementation of `func_1` does not correctly determine the minimum number of elements to remove to make the array non-beautiful. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
