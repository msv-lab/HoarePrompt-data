### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the minimum number of elements to remove from a given beautiful array to make it non-beautiful. A beautiful array is one where you can make all elements the same by repeatedly performing a specific operation.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The given solution checks if the array is already uniform (all elements are the same). If so, it prints `-1` because no removals are needed.
   - It also calculates the minimum number of elements to remove to break the beauty condition.

3. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - The function reads the size of the array `n` and the array itself.
   - It checks if the array is already uniform by comparing adjacent elements. If any two adjacent elements are different, it sets `flag` to `False`.
   - If the array is uniform, it prints `-1` and returns.
   - Otherwise, it counts the occurrences of the first element (`val`) and finds the minimum count of consecutive elements that are the same. This helps in determining the minimum number of removals needed.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The solution correctly handles the case where the array is uniform.
   - However, the logic to calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition is flawed. The current implementation only considers the first element (`val`) and counts the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of this element. This does not necessarily give the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

5. **Detailed Analysis**:
   - Consider the example provided in the problem description: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 1]`. The solution would count the maximum consecutive occurrences of `1` (which is 3) and print `1` as the answer. However, the correct answer should be `1` because removing the element at index 5 (value `1`) breaks the beauty condition.
   - Similarly, for the array `[3, 3, 3, 5, 3, 3, 3]`, the solution would count the maximum consecutive occurrences of `3` (which is 4) and print `3` as the answer. However, the correct answer should be `3` because removing the first three elements (values `3, 3, 3`) breaks the beauty condition.

6. **Implementation**:
   - The logic in `func_1()` is not sound for calculating the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition. The current implementation only considers the first element and does not account for other possible sequences of identical elements.

7. **Correctness**:
   - The solution correctly identifies whether the array is uniform.
   - However, it does not correctly calculate the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition.

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect based on the problem description. The logic to determine the minimum number of removals needed to break the beauty condition is flawed.

**Correctness: **False**

Final: **False**
