Output State: **`flag` is False, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting each element to an integer, `ans` is set to Decimal('Infinity')**.

The code initializes the variable `ans` to `Decimal('Infinity')`. This does not affect the values of `flag`, `t`, `n`, or `arr`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states. The only change is that `ans` is now set to `Decimal('Infinity')`.
