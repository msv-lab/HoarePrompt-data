Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an input from the user and converts it to an integer. This integer is stored in the variable `t`. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged as they were part of the initial state and were not affected by the code snippet.
