Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly generate a string with exactly `n` special characters as described. Specifically, the string generation logic `'110' * (n // 2)` does not ensure that each character is special according to the definition provided. For example, if `n = 2`, the generated string would be `'110'`, which has only one special character ('1'), not two. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where `n` is odd, which is explicitly stated as a valid scenario in the problem description. The program incorrectly prints 'NO' for odd `n`, but it should generate a valid string if possible.
