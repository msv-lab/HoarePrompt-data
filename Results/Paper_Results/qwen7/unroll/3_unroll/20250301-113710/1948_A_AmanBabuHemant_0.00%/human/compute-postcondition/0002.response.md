Output State: `t` test cases are processed. For each test case:
- If the input number `n` is odd, the output is "NO".
- If the input number `n` is even and less than or equal to 400, the output is "YES" followed by a string consisting of "110" repeated `n//2` times, but truncated to a maximum length of 200.
- If the input number `n` is even but greater than 400, the output is "NO".
