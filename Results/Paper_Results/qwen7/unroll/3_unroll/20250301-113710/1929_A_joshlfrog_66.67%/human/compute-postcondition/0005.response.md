Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads an integer `t` (number of sub-cases), an integer `n` (number of integers), and a list of `n` integers. It then finds the maximum and minimum values in the list and prints their difference. The function does not return any value but prints the result for each test case.**
