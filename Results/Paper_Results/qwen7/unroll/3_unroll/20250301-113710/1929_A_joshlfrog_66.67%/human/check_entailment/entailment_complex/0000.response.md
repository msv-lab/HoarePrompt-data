Reasoning:
The given program aims to find the maximum beauty of an array by rearranging its elements to maximize the sum of differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`. However, the current implementation does not correctly achieve this goal. Instead, it simply prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array for each test case.

To maximize the beauty of the array, we should sort the array in either ascending or descending order. This ensures that the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` are maximized. Here's why:

- If the array is sorted in ascending order, the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will be positive and as large as possible.
- If the array is sorted in descending order, the differences `(a_i - a_{i-1})` will also be positive and as large as possible.

Given this, the correct approach would be to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

However, the provided code simply prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which does not necessarily yield the maximum beauty of the array.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
