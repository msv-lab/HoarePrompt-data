Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. The logic in the program only calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which does not necessarily maximize the beauty of the array as defined in the problem statement. The beauty of the array is the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements, and this program does not account for rearranging the elements to maximize these differences.
