Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the integer input value; other variables are not defined yet.**

The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 500`, the new value of `t` will still satisfy this condition. However, since no input value is provided here, the exact value of `t` remains unspecified. All other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n`) are not defined yet and will be assigned values later in the program.
