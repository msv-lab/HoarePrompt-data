Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer `t` (where 1 ≤ t ≤ 500) representing the number of sub-cases, an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of integers, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). It does not return a value directly but processes each test case according to the given constraints and relationships between the inputs.**
