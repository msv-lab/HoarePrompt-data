Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it splits the input string `s` into hours (`h`) and minutes (`m`).
3. The program uses a series of `if-elif` statements to convert the 24-hour format hours into 12-hour format hours and determines whether the time is in the AM or PM period.
4. However, there is redundancy in the code. The logic can be simplified using the modulo operation to handle the conversion from 24-hour to 12-hour format more efficiently.
5. Despite the redundancy, the logic for converting hours and determining AM/PM is correct.
6. The final output format matches the required format.

Despite the redundancy, the program will still produce the correct output for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
