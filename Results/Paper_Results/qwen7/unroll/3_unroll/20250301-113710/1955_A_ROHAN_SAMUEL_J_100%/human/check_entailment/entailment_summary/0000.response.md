Reasoning:
The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down the logic:

1. **Odd Number of Yogurts (`n % 2`):**
   - If \( n \) is odd, the program checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If \( 2a < b \), it means buying two yogurts for \( b \) burles is cheaper than buying each yogurt at \( a \) burles. In this case, it's better to buy as many pairs of yogurts as possible and then buy the remaining yogurt at the regular price.
     - Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at the regular price.

2. **Even Number of Yogurts:**
   - If \( n \) is even, the program directly checks if buying two yogurts at the promotional price is cheaper than buying each yogurt individually.
     - If \( 2a < b \), it means buying two yogurts for \( b \) burles is cheaper than buying each yogurt at \( a \) burles. In this case, it's better to buy all yogurts in pairs.
     - Otherwise, it's cheaper to buy all yogurts individually at the regular price.

The program correctly handles both scenarios and matches the logic described in the problem statement. It processes each test case independently and prints the minimum cost for each case.

Given the logic and the execution summary, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
