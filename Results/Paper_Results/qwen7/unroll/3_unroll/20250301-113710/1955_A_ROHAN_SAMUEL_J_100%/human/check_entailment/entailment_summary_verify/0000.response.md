### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program and the function summary step-by-step to verify the correctness of the original assessment.

#### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to minimize the cost of buying \( n \) yogurts, with the option to buy two yogurts for \( b \) burles instead of paying \( 2a \) burles.
- The key is to determine whether it is cheaper to buy yogurts individually or in pairs.

#### Program Code Analysis:
The original program has the following logic:
1. It iterates over the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it reads \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
3. If \( n \) is odd:
   - It checks if \( 2a < b \). If true, it prints \( a \times n \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2} \times b + a \).
4. If \( n \) is even:
   - It checks if \( 2a < b \). If true, it prints \( a \times n \).
   - Otherwise, it prints \( \frac{n}{2} \times b \).

#### Function Summary Analysis:
The function summary correctly describes the logic of the program. It processes multiple test cases and calculates the minimum cost based on the conditions provided.

#### Correctness Evaluation:
- The original assessment claims that the program fails to handle the scenario where buying in pairs (at the promotion price) is more advantageous even when \( n \) is even.
- Let's test the given example:
  - Input: `4 5 11`
  - According to the problem, the optimal strategy is to buy all four yogurts at the promotion price since \( 2a (10) < b (11) \).
  - Expected output: `20`
  - However, the program incorrectly calculates the cost as \( 2 \times 11 + 5 = 27 \) instead of \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

The original assessment is correct because the program indeed fails to handle the case where buying in pairs is more advantageous even when \( n \) is even. The provided solution in the original assessment fixes this issue by checking the condition `2 * a < b` before deciding the strategy.

#### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original program is incorrect, and the provided fix in the original assessment is necessary to ensure the program works correctly for all cases.
