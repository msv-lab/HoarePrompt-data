Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires constructing a sequence of \( n \) non-negative integers such that their sum equals \( k \), and the bitwise OR of the sequence has the maximum number of 1s in its binary representation.

2. **Function Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(n, k)` is designed to generate such a sequence.
   - It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` with zeros.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it sets `nums[i]` to the largest possible value with all bits set to 1 that fits within the bit length of `k`.
   - Specifically, `nums[i]` is set to \( (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 \), which is the largest number with all bits set to 1 that fits within the bit length of `k`.
   - After setting all elements to this value, it subtracts this value from `k`.
   - Finally, it adjusts the last element of `nums` to ensure the sum of `nums` equals `k`.

3. **Binary Representation Consideration**:
   - Setting each element to \( (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1 \) ensures that each element contributes the maximum possible number of 1s in the bitwise OR.
   - The bitwise OR of a sequence of numbers with many 1s in their binary representation will have even more 1s, maximizing the number of 1s in the final result.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is a power of 2, the largest number with all bits set to 1 that fits within the bit length of `k` is \( k-1 \).
   - If `k` is not a power of 2, the largest number with all bits set to 1 that fits within the bit length of `k` is still \( k-1 \).

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - The last element is adjusted to ensure the sum of the sequence equals `k`.

Given the analysis, the function correctly constructs a sequence that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
