You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n and k are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all n over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func_1(n, k):
    nums = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        nums[i] = (1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1
        
        k -= nums[i]
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and `k` is less than or equal to 0.
    #
    #Explanation: In each iteration of the loop, `nums[i]` is assigned the value `(1 << k.bit_length() - 1) - 1`, which is `k-1` if `k` is a positive power of 2, otherwise it's the largest number with all bits set to 1 that fits within the bit length of `k`. Then `k` is decreased by the value of `nums[i]`. Since `nums[i]` is always `k-1`, `k` will eventually become less than or equal to 0 after at most `k` iterations. Thus, after the loop, each element in `nums` will be `k-1`, and `k` will be less than or equal to 0.
    nums[-1] += k
    return nums
    #The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element is also `k-1` with `k` being less than or equal to 0.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers. It returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element is also `k-1`. Additionally, `k` must be less than or equal to 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is `k-1`, and the last element is also `k-1` with `k` being less than or equal to 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
