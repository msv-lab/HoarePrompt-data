Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variables `i`, `n`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the initial value of `i` should be set to 0 (or 1 if the loop is inclusive), and `n` must be at least 1.

3. **Initial Values**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This variable is not directly involved in the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1.
   - `k` is an integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\). This variable is not directly involved in the loop execution, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.
   - `nums` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros. This list is not directly involved in the loop head, so it doesn't need to be adjusted.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - The variable `i` should be set to 0 (or 1 if the loop is inclusive) because the loop starts from 0 and increments `i` in each iteration.
   - The variable `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

Given these points, the adjusted state before the loop starts is:

**State: **`i` is 0 (or 1 if the loop is inclusive), `n` must be at least 1**.
