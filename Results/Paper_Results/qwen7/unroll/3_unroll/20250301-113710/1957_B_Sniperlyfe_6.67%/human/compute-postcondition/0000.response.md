Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` and `k` are integers for each test case such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9, and the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `nums` is a list of length `n` filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a list `nums` with `n` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or the condition that the sum of all `n` over all test cases does not exceed `2 ⋅ 10^5`. Therefore, these conditions and values remain unchanged. The only new information is that `nums` is now a list of length `n` filled with zeros.
