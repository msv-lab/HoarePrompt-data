The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both integers. It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to `k-1`. After the loop, the last element of `nums` is adjusted by adding any remaining value of `k` (which is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 0). The function then returns the list `nums`.
