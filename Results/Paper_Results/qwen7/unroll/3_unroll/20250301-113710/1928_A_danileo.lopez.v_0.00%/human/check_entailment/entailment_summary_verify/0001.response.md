### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires determining if Bob can transform a given rectangle of dimensions \(a \times b\) into another rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
   - A key observation is that if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, Bob can always achieve this transformation. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, no such transformation is possible.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The function `func()` reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the dimensions \(a\) and \(b\).
   - It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even using the condition `if a % 2 == 0 or b % 2 == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, it prints 'Yes'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'No'.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic in the program correctly identifies when a transformation is possible based on the parity (odd/even nature) of \(a\) and \(b\).
   - Specifically:
     - If either \(a\) or \(b\) is even, the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles, and those smaller rectangles can be rearranged to form another rectangle.
     - If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, the only way to cut the rectangle would result in two smaller rectangles of odd dimensions, which cannot be rearranged to form a new rectangle of different dimensions.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles all edge cases correctly as per the problem statement. For example:
     - \(1 \times 1\) (both dimensions are odd) → Output: "No"
     - \(2 \times 1\) (one dimension is even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(2 \times 6\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(3 \times 2\) (one dimension is even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(2 \times 2\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(2 \times 4\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "Yes"
     - \(6 \times 3\) (both dimensions are even) → Output: "No"

### Conclusion:
The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given dimensions. Therefore, the program is correct.

**Final Evaluation: True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly determines whether Bob can form another rectangle from the given dimensions based on the parity of the dimensions.
