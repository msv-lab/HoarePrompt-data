Reasoning:

1. The problem requires determining whether Bob can obtain another rectangle by cutting the given rectangle into two smaller rectangles and then rearranging them.
2. The provided solution checks if either `a` or `b` is even. If at least one of them is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
3. This logic is based on the observation that if either dimension of the original rectangle is even, it can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a new rectangle.
4. Specifically:
   - If `a` is even, we can cut the rectangle into `a/2` rows of `b` columns each, and then rearrange these rows to form a new rectangle.
   - Similarly, if `b` is even, we can cut the rectangle into `b/2` columns of `a` rows each, and then rearrange these columns to form a new rectangle.
5. The solution correctly implements this logic by checking if either `a` or `b` is even and printing the appropriate result.
6. The provided test cases validate the correctness of this approach.

Given the above reasoning, the provided solution is correct.

Correctness: **True**
