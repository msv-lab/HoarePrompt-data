Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines whether Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle based on the problem description. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Odd Dimensions Check**: The program checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even.
2. **Condition for Obtaining Another Rectangle**: If either dimension is even, it means the rectangle can be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form another rectangle. If both dimensions are odd, it is impossible to form another distinct rectangle through the allowed operations (since cutting an odd-sized side results in two smaller odd-sized sides, and these cannot be recombined to form a new rectangle of different dimensions).

Given the logic and the constraints, the program correctly implements the solution as per the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
