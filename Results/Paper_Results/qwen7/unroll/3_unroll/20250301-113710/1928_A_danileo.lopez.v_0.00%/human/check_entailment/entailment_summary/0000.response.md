Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if Bob can obtain a different rectangle from the given \(a \times b\) rectangle by cutting it into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.
2. The provided solution checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even. If either dimension is even, it prints 'Yes', indicating that another rectangle can be formed. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
3. This logic is based on the observation that if either dimension is even, the rectangle can always be divided into smaller rectangles that can be rearranged to form a different rectangle. For example:
   - If \(a\) is even, it can be split into two equal halves, and these halves can be rearranged to form a rectangle with dimensions \(\frac{a}{2} \times b\).
   - Similarly, if \(b\) is even, it can be split into two equal halves, and these halves can be rearranged to form a rectangle with dimensions \(a \times \frac{b}{2}\).
4. The provided solution correctly implements this logic. It checks if either \(a\) or \(b\) is even and prints 'Yes' if true, indicating that another rectangle can be formed. If both \(a\) and \(b\) are odd, it prints 'No', indicating that no other rectangle can be formed.

Given the above reasoning, the provided program correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
