You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, a, b, and m are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18}.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        if m < a and m < b:
            print(2)
        elif m < a and m > b:
            print(2 + m // b)
        elif m < b and m > a:
            print(2 + m // a)
        else:
            print(m // a + m // b + 2)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop executing `t` times. For each iteration, the value printed depends on the comparison between `m`, `a`, and `b`. Specifically:
    #
    #- If `m` is less than both `a` and `b`, it prints `2`.
    #- If `m` is less than `a` but greater than `b`, it prints `2 + m // b`.
    #- If `m` is less than `b` but greater than `a`, it prints `2 + m // a`.
    #- Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.
    #
    #Each line of the output corresponds to one iteration of the loop, with `i` ranging from `0` to `t-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes test cases where each test case includes three integers t, a, b, and m. For each test case, it checks if t is within the range 1 to 10^4, and if a, b, and m are within the range 1 to 10^18. It then performs operations based on these values but does not specify what those operations are. The function returns a result based on the processed test case.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
