Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed as a result of the loop's execution. For each iteration `i` from `0` to `t-1`, the value of `m` is compared with `a` and `b`. Based on the conditions provided, the script prints one of the following:

- If `m < a` and `m < b`, it prints `2`.
- If `m < a` and `m > b`, it prints `2 + m // b`.
- If `m < b` and `m > a`, it prints `2 + m // a`.
- Otherwise, it prints `m // a + m // b + 2`.

Each line of output corresponds to the result of one iteration of the loop.
