Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case.
2. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.
3. The logic for determining the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously is as follows:
   - If `m < a` and `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is 2 because the next launch times for both installations will exceed `m`.
   - If `m < a` and `m > b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // b` because the next launch time for the second installation will be within `m` minutes.
   - If `m < b` and `m > a`, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `2 + m // a` because the next launch time for the first installation will be within `m` minutes.
   - Otherwise, the maximum number of fireworks visible at any time is `m // a + m // b + 2` because both installations have launch times within `m` minutes, and we need to account for the additional fireworks from both installations.

This logic appears to cover all possible scenarios and matches the problem statement's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
