Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5; `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n; `n` and `k` are assigned the values from `input().split()` converted to integers.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input and splits them using `input().split()`, then converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and retains its initial state.
