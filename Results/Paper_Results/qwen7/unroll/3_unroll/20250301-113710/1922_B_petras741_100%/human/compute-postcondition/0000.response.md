Output State: **`t` is an input integer where 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) remains valid after the code is executed. The other parts of the initial state (such as the conditions for `n` and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`) are not affected by this line of code and thus remain unchanged.
