Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) such that the given position \( n \) and number \( x \) fit into the described settling pattern. The key steps involve calculating the divisors of a specific value derived from \( n \) and \( x \).

2. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1(q, x)` is designed to find all divisors of `q` that are greater than or equal to `x - 1`.
   - It correctly calculates the integer square root of `q` and checks if it meets the condition.
   - It then iterates through potential divisors, ensuring they meet the criteria before adding them to the list `M`.

3. **Main Program Analysis**:
   - The main program correctly calculates `y = n + x` and checks if `y` is even. If not, it prints `0` and continues to the next test case.
   - If `y` is even, it calls `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `x`, and stores the result.
   - If `n >= 3 * x - 2`, it calls `func_1` again with `((n - x) // 2)` and `x`, and adds the results.
   - The final step is to convert the list to a set to remove duplicates and print the length of the resulting list.

4. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The program handles the constraints and edge cases appropriately, such as when `n` is less than `3 * x - 2`.
   - The logic for calculating the divisors and filtering them based on the conditions is sound.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the problem description and the provided execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
