Output State: **For each test case, the output is a sequence of numbers starting with 1, followed by alternating elements from the beginning and end of the array [1, 2, ..., n], until the entire array is traversed.**

To break it down further:
- The loop processes each test case individually.
- For each test case, it reads `n` and `k` (though `k` is not used in the loop logic).
- It initializes an array with numbers from 1 to n.
- The variable `answer` starts with `[1]`.
- The loop then iterates from 1 to n-1, appending elements to `answer` based on whether the index `i` is odd or even:
  - If `i` is odd, it appends the element at the position given by `a[-1]` (which starts at 1 and decrements).
  - If `i` is even, it appends the element at the position given by `a[0]` (which starts at 1 and increments).
- This process continues until the entire array is traversed, resulting in a sequence that alternates between the start and end of the original array, starting with 1.
