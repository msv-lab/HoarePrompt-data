You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an array a of length n , a positive integer m , and a string of
commands of length n . Each command is either the character 'L' or the
character 'R'.

Process all n commands in the order they are written in the string s .
Processing a command is done as follows:

  * First, output the remainder of the product of all elements of the array a when divided by m . 
  * Then, if the command is 'L', remove the leftmost element from the array a , if the command is 'R', remove the rightmost element from the array a . 

Note that after each move, the length of the array a decreases by 1 , and
after processing all commands, it will be empty.

Write a program that will process all commands in the order they are written
in the string s (from left to right).

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases in the input. Then descriptions of t test cases follow.

Each test case of the input is given by three lines.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^5, 1 \le m
\le 10^4 ) — the initial length of the array a and the value to take the
remainder by.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^4 )
— the elements of the array a .

The third line contains a string s consisting of n characters 'L' and 'R'.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases in a test
does not exceed 2\cdot10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output n integers b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n , where b_i is the
remainder when dividing the product of all elements of the current state of
the array a by m at the beginning of the execution of the i -th command.

Note

In the first test case of the example:

  * 3 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 24 \bmod 6 = 0 ;
  * s_1 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get the array [1, 4, 2] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \cdot 2 \bmod 6 = 8 \bmod 6 = 2 ;
  * s_2 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1, 4] ;
  * 1 \cdot 4 \bmod 6 = 4 \bmod 6 = 4 ;
  * s_3 = \text{R} , so we remove the last element and get the array [1] ;
  * 1 \bmod 6 = 1 ;
  * s_4 = \text{L} , so we remove the first element and get an empty array.

    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000006, `res` is a list of integers obtained after processing each test case, where each element is calculated based on the given operations within the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `m`, initializes the array `arr`, and reads the string `s`.

2. **Result Array Initialization**:
   - The result array `res` is initialized with zeros of size `n`.

3. **Initial Product Calculation**:
   - The product of all elements in `arr` is calculated and stored in `ans`. This product is then taken modulo `m` and `MOD` (a large prime number to prevent overflow).
   - The first element of `res` is set to this value.

4. **Processing Commands**:
   - The program iterates over the string `s` and processes each command.
   - If the command is 'L', it divides `ans` by the leftmost element of `arr` and updates `l` to point to the next element.
   - If the command is 'R', it divides `ans` by the rightmost element of `arr` and updates `r` to point to the previous element.
   - After each operation, the new value of `ans` is taken modulo `m` and `MOD`, and stored in the appropriate position in `res`.

5. **Output**:
   - The result array `res` is printed for each test case.

### Issues Identified

1. **Incorrect Modulo Operation**:
   - The program initializes `ans` with the product of all elements in `arr` and takes modulo `m` and `MOD` immediately.
   - However, the problem specifies that the product should be taken modulo `m` at each step, not just once before any operations.
   - This means the product should be updated modulo `m` after each division operation, not just at the end.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Initial Product**:
   - The initial product `ans` should be taken modulo `m` directly without the extra `MOD` operation unless necessary.

3. **Incorrect Indexing**:
   - The loop should run from `0` to `n-1` to correctly handle the removal of elements from both ends of the array.

### Corrected Program

Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = [0] * n
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res[0] = ans
        c = 1
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n - 1):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m
                res[c] = ans
                r -= 1
            c += 1
        print(*res)
```

### Conclusion

The original program has logical errors in handling the product modulo `m` and the indexing. The corrected program ensures that the product is updated modulo `m` at each step and handles the removal of elements correctly.
