Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000006.**

Explanation: The code defines a constant `MOD` with the value `10 ** 9 + 6`, which is calculated to be `1000000006`. This value replaces the placeholder for `MOD` in the initial state. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `s`) remain unchanged from their initial state conditions.
