Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided solution has several issues that make it incorrect:

1. **Initialization of `ans`:**
   - The variable `ans` is initialized with the product of all elements in the array before any commands are processed. This means that the first result (`res[0]`) is already computed incorrectly because it should be the product of all elements modulo `m`, not the full product modulo `MOD`.

2. **Modulo Operation Order:**
   - The modulo operation should be applied immediately after each multiplication to prevent overflow and ensure correctness. However, the code applies `% MOD` only once at the end, which is incorrect.

3. **Loop Range:**
   - The loop runs `n-1` times, but it should run `n` times since there are `n` commands.

4. **Updating `ans`:**
   - When removing elements from the array, the product `ans` should be updated correctly by dividing by the removed element and taking the modulo at each step.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        s = list(input())
        res = []
        ans = 1
        for i in arr:
            ans = (ans * i) % m
        res.append(ans)
        
        l = 0
        r = n - 1
        for k in range(n):
            if s[k] == 'L':
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[l], -1, m)) % m
                l += 1
            else:
                ans = (ans * pow(arr[r], -1, m)) % m
                r -= 1
            res.append(ans)
        
        print(*res)

func()
```

This corrected version ensures that the product is updated correctly and modulo operations are applied at each step, ensuring the results are accurate.
