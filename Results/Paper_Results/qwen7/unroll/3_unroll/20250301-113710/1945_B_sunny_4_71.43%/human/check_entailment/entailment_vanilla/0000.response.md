Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases.
   - It then iterates `t` times, reading three integers `a`, `b`, and `m` for each test case.

2. **Calculating Maximum Visible Fireworks:**
   - For each test case, the program calculates `A` as `int(m / a) + 1`.
   - Similarly, it calculates `B` as `int(m / b) + 1`.
   - The program then prints the sum `A + B`.

3. **Understanding the Logic:**
   - `A` represents the number of fireworks launched by the first installation within the visibility period `m`.
   - `B` represents the number of fireworks launched by the second installation within the same period `m`.
   - The sum `A + B` gives the total number of fireworks launched by both installations within the visibility period `m`.

4. **Checking the Constraints:**
   - The constraints are \(1 \le a, b, m \le 10^{18}\).
   - Given these large values, using `int(m / a) + 1` and `int(m / b) + 1` might lead to inaccuracies due to integer division truncation. However, since we are adding 1 to the result of the division, it should correctly account for the ceiling value.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - When `a` or `b` is equal to `m`, the calculation `int(m / a)` or `int(m / b)` will correctly return 1, which is the expected number of fireworks.
   - When `a` or `b` is greater than `m`, the result of the division will be 0, and adding 1 will give 1, which is also correct.

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to be correct based on the given problem statement and constraints. It correctly calculates the number of fireworks launched by each installation within the visibility period and sums them up.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **True**
