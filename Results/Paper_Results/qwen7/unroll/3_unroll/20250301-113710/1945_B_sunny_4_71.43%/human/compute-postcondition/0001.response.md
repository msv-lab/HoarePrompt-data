Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable here is `t`.

2. **Determine the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an input integer and its value is given as \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.

3. **Adjust the state**: Given that `t` is an input integer and its value is within the specified range, the only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute is to confirm that `t` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:

**State: **`t` must be greater than 0**.
