Reasoning:
The annotated program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Simultaneous Fireworks**:
   - For each test case, it calculates the number of fireworks that can be seen from the first installation (`A`) and the second installation (`B`).
   - The formula used is \( A = \left\lceil \frac{m}{a} \right\rceil + 1 \) and \( B = \left\lceil \frac{m}{b} \right\rceil + 1 \).
   - These formulas account for the fact that each firework is visible for `m + 1` minutes, but we need to consider the ceiling function to ensure we count the last interval correctly.

3. **Summing Up**:
   - The program then prints the sum of `A` and `B` for each test case, which gives the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously.

Given the problem statement and the provided example, the logic in the program matches the requirements. The calculations are correct, and the output is as expected.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
