Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `t` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, after executing the code, `t` will still be within this range but now it specifically holds the value entered by the user. All other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `t` is an integer within the specified range remains valid.
