Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and the list a is a list of integers where each element a[i] is increased by (i + 1) for all i in the range of n.

This means that after the loop executes all the iterations, each element in the list `a` will have been incremented by its index plus one.
