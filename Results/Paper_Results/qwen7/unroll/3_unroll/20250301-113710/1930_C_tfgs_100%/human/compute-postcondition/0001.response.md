Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 10^4, n is an input integer, and the list a is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string and converting each element to an integer.**

Explanation: The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state.
