Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the objects in the loop head**: The loop head is `for i in range(n)`. The objects involved here are `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these objects**:
   - `i` is initialized to 0 when the loop starts.
   - `n` is an input integer.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `i < n`. Therefore, the loop can start if `n` is at least 1.

4. **Adjust the states based on the loop requirements**:
   - Since `i` is initialized to 0, no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0.

5. **Consider the given initial state**:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string and converting each element to an integer.

Given this information, the only variables that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n`, ensuring it is greater than 0.

**Final State**:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0**
