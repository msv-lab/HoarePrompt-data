Output State: **`counter` is a Counter object containing the counts of each element in the list `a`, `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer, and `cur` is 0.**

The code initializes the variable `cur` to 0. This does not affect the values of `counter`, `t`, or `n`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
