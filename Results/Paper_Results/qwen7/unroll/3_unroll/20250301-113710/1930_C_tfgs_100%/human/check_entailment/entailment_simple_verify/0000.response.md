### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and its behavior step-by-step to determine if it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Insertion Logic**: The program increments each element \(a_i\) by \(i+1\) before inserting it into the set \(S\). This ensures that no duplicates are added because the set only stores unique elements.
2. **Set Operations**: The program uses a set to store the modified values and then converts it to a sorted list in descending order to form the array \(b\).
3. **Handling Duplicates**: Since the set inherently avoids duplicates, the program ensures that each value is unique in \(S\).

#### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Input Reading and Modification**:
   ```python
   n = int(input())
   a = list(map(int, input().split()))
   for i in range(n):
       a[i] += i + 1
   ```
   - This part correctly modifies each element \(a_i\) by adding \(i+1\).

2. **Creating Set and Sorting**:
   ```python
   counter = Counter(a)
   cur = 0
   a = list(set(a))
   a.sort(reverse=True)
   cnt = n - len(a)
   ans = []
   ```
   - The set conversion ensures that all elements in \(S\) are unique.
   - Sorting in descending order prepares the list for forming the lexicographically largest array \(b\).

3. **Filling Gaps and Handling Remaining Elements**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(a)):
       if i > 0:
           adv = min(a[i - 1] - a[i] - 1, cnt, cur)
           for j in range(adv):
               ans.append(a[i - 1] - j - 1)
           cnt -= adv
           cur -= adv
       ans.append(a[i])
       counter[a[i]] -= 1
       cur += counter[a[i]]
   for _ in range(cnt):
       ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
   ```
   - This loop ensures that there are no gaps between consecutive elements in the final list \(ans\).
   - The logic for filling gaps and handling remaining elements is correct and ensures that the list is filled in a way that maintains the lexicographical order.

4. **Output**:
   ```python
   print(*ans)
   ```

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to ensure that the elements are inserted into the set \(S\) in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order of the final array \(b\). The program ensures that no duplicates are added to the set and fills the gaps appropriately.

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect. The provided program does indeed correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
