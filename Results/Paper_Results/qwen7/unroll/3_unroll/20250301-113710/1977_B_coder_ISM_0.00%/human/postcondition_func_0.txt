The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a positive integer `t` and another positive integer `x`. For each test case, it converts `x` into its 30-bit binary representation, modifies this binary string based on certain conditions, and outputs the modified binary string along with its length. Specifically, it flips certain bits and changes some '1's to '-1's under specific rules. The final output includes the modified binary string and its length for each test case.
