Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each input value of x, the binary representation of x is transformed through a series of operations, resulting in a new string s with possible characters '1', '0', or '-1'. The length of the string s may change during these operations. After processing all inputs, the final length and content of s for each input are printed.
