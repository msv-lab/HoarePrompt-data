Reasoning:

1. **Initial Binary Conversion**: The program correctly converts the integer `x` into its 30-bit binary representation. This is done using the loop where it checks each bit position from 0 to 29 and appends '1' or '0' to the list `s` based on whether the corresponding bit is set in `x`.

2. **Modification Logic**: The program then attempts to modify the binary string `s` according to the specified conditions:
   - If `flag` is set and the current bit is '0', it sets the current bit to '1'.
   - If `flag` is not set and the current bit and the next bit are both '1', it sets the current bit to '-1' and sets `flag` to 1.
   - If `flag` is set and the last bit is '0', it sets the last bit to '1'.
   - If `flag` is set and the last bit is '1', it adds a new bit '1' at the end, increments the length, and sets the last bit to '0'.

3. **Final Adjustment**: The program ensures that no two consecutive bits are '1' by iterating through the string and adjusting the bits as necessary.

4. **Output**: The program prints the length of the modified binary string and the string itself, which should satisfy the conditions of the problem.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the program appears to correctly generate a valid array `a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}` for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
