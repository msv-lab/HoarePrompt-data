You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given a positive integer x . Find any array of integers a_0, a_1,
\ldots, a_{n-1} for which the following holds:

  * 1 \le n \le 32 , 
  * a_i is 1 , 0 , or -1 for all 0 \le i \le n - 1 , 
  * x = \displaystyle{\sum_{i=0}^{n - 1}{a_i \cdot 2^i}} , 
  * There does not exist an index 0 \le i \le n - 2 such that both a_{i} \neq 0 and a_{i + 1} \neq 0 . 

It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, a valid array
always exists.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer x (1 \le x
< 2^{30} ).

Output

For each test case, output two lines.

On the first line, output an integer n (1 \le n \le 32 ) — the length of the
array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

On the second line, output the array a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1} .

If there are multiple valid arrays, you can output any of them.

Example

    14
    
    24
    
    15
    
    27
    
    11
    
    19

Output

    1
    1
    5
    0 -1 0 0 1
    6
    0 0 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 0 0 1
    6
    -1 0 -1 0 0 1
    5
    -1 0 -1 0 1
    5
    -1 0 1 0 1

Note

In the first test case, one valid array is [1] , since (1) \cdot 2^0 = 1 .

In the second test case, one possible valid array is [0,-1,0,0,1] , since (0)
\cdot 2^0 + (-1) \cdot 2^1 + (0) \cdot 2^2 + (0) \cdot 2^3 + (1) \cdot 2^4 =
-2 + 16 = 14 .

Each string will be of length up to 31 characters ('-1', '0', or '1'), and the length of the string printed at the end of each iteration will indicate the modified length of the binary representation. The exact content of each string will depend on the input provided during each iteration of the loop.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `x`.

2. **Binary Representation:**
   - The program constructs a binary representation of `x` using a list `s` of length 30.
   - If the bit at position `i` (from right to left, starting from 0) in `x` is set (`x & pow(2, i)`), it appends `'1'` to `s`; otherwise, it appends `'0'`.

3. **Adjusting the Array:**
   - The program iterates through the list `s` to ensure no two consecutive non-zero elements exist.
   - It uses a flag to track whether a change has been made in the current iteration.
   - If a change is made (flag is set to 1), it adjusts the elements accordingly:
     - If the current element is `'1'` and the previous element is `'1'`, it changes the current element to `'0'` and sets the flag.
     - If the current element is `'1'` and the previous element is `'0'`, it changes the current element to `'-'` and sets the flag.
   - After processing the list, it ensures the last element is adjusted correctly if necessary.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the length of the array `s`.
   - It then prints the array `s`.

### Verification Against Constraints and Requirements

1. **Array Length:**
   - The array length is fixed at 30, but the problem allows lengths up to 32. This is a potential issue.

2. **Element Values:**
   - The program only uses `'1'`, `'0'`, and `'-'` to represent the elements, which aligns with the problem constraints.

3. **No Consecutive Non-Zero Elements:**
   - The program ensures that no two consecutive non-zero elements exist, which is a key requirement.

4. **Sum Calculation:**
   - The program constructs the binary representation of `x` correctly, but it does not explicitly calculate the sum. Instead, it relies on the binary representation to meet the sum condition.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues

1. **Length Constraint:**
   - The program hard-codes the length to 30, which might fail for numbers that require more than 30 bits. This is a significant flaw.

2. **Handling Larger Numbers:**
   - For numbers requiring more than 30 bits, the program will not work as intended. It should dynamically adjust the length based on the number of bits required.

### Conclusion

Given the above analysis, the program is incorrect because it does not handle numbers that require more than 30 bits. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
