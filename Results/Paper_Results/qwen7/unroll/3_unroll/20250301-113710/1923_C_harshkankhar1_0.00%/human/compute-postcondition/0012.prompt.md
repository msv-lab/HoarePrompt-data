You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer; for each test case, n and q are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5; the array c is a list of n positive integers where 1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^9; for each query, l_i and r_i are positive integers such that 1 ≤ l_i ≤ r_i ≤ n.
def func_1():
    n, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + [int(x) for x in input().split()]
    b = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        x = 1 if a[i] > 1 else 2
        
        b[i] = b[i - 1] + x
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered as input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`, otherwise `x = 2`), starting from `b[0] = 0`.
    a = list(accumulate(a))
    print(*a)
    #This is printed: the cumulative sums of the original list `a`
    for _ in range(q):
        x, y = map(int, input().split())
        
        print('NO') if a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1] or x == y else print('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the elements in the original list `a`, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (if `a[i] > 1`, then `x = 1`, otherwise `x = 2`), starting from `b[0] = 0`, the loop iterates `q` times, each time reading two integers `x` and `y` from input, and printing 'NO' if `a[y] - a[x - 1] < b[y] - b[x - 1]` or `x == y`, otherwise printing 'YES'. The values of `t`, `n`, `q`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged after the loop executes all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer t, followed by an integer n, an integer q, an array c of n positive integers, and q queries. Each query consists of two integers l_i and r_i. For each query, the function returns whether the subarray of c from index l_i to r_i (inclusive) meets certain conditions or not.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
