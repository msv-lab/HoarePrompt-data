Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer.**

The code reads two integers, `n` and `q`, from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. These values replace the previous values of `t` (which was a positive integer), and now `n` and `q` are assigned these new values. The initial value of `t` is no longer relevant since it has been replaced. The conditions on `n` and `q` (1 ≤ n, q ≤ 3 × 10^5) are preserved as they are constraints on the input values. The array `c` and the queries defined by `l_i` and `r_i` remain unchanged and will be processed later in the program.
