Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `q` is an input integer, `a` is a list starting with 0 followed by integers entered as input, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `a[i]` (either `b[i-1] + 1` if `a[i] > 1` or `b[i-1] + 2` otherwise).
