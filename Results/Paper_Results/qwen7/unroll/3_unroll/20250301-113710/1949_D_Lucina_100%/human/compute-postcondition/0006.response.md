Output State: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'F' received from all inputs at the corresponding index; `b` is a list of length n+1 where each element is the count of 'S' received from all inputs at the corresponding index; `xx` is a list containing `n` strings, each being the input received at each iteration of the loop.
