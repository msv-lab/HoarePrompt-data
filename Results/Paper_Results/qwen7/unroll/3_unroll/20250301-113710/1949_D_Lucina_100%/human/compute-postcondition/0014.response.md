Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n + 1`.

2. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 and is incremented until it reaches `n + 1`.

3. **Adjust the States**: We need to adjust the state such that the loop can start executing. Specifically, we need to set `i` to 1 (the starting value) and ensure that `n + 1` is a valid number.

Given the initial states:
- `t` is the length of `sa`.
- `sa` contains indices `i` where `a[i]` is greater than 0 and `b[i]` is 0.
- `sb` is an empty list.
- `xx` is a list of `n` strings received during each iteration of the loop.
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with their original counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively.
- `n` is the original input integer.

We need to focus on adjusting the states related to the loop head variables `i` and `n + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` should be set to 1.
- `n + 1` should be a valid number (which it already is since `n` is an integer).

### Final State:
State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be a valid integer**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `i` initialized to 1 and `n + 1` being a valid number.
