Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24; `a` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros; `b` is a list of length n+1 filled with zeros.**

Explanation: The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the list `a`. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer between 2 and 24, and `a` remains a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros.
