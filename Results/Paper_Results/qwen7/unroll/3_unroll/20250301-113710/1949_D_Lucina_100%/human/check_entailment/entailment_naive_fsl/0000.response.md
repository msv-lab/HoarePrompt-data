Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. 

Consider the following input:

```
5
.??F?
.??.?
F??.?
??S.?
????.
```

The output generated by the program is:

```
.FFFF
F.FFF
FF.SF
FFS.F
FFFF.
```

Let's analyze this output for the permutation `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`:
- The sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, S, F, F`.
- This sequence has 3 consecutive `F`'s, which is within the limit of \(\lceil \frac{3 \times 5}{4} \rceil = 4\).

However, let's consider another permutation, say `1, 3, 2, 4, 5`:
- The sequence of transition videos would be `F, S, F, S, F`.
- This sequence also has 3 consecutive `F`'s, which is within the limit.

But now consider the permutation `1, 4, 2, 3, 5`:
- The sequence of transition videos would be `F, S, F, S, F`.
- This sequence again has 3 consecutive `F`'s, which is within the limit.

The issue arises when considering the permutation `1, 5, 2, 3, 4`:
- The sequence of transition videos would be `F, F, F, S, F`.
- This sequence has 3 consecutive `F`'s, which is within the limit.

However, the real problem is when considering the permutation `1, 3, 4, 2, 5`:
- The sequence of transition videos would be `F, S, S, F, F`.
- This sequence has 3 consecutive `F`'s, which is within the limit.

The critical issue is that the program does not ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) transition videos of the same type appear consecutively for any permutation of the scenarios. The program does not handle the distribution of `F` and `S` values in a way that guarantees this condition for all permutations.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirement for certain permutations, making it incorrect.
