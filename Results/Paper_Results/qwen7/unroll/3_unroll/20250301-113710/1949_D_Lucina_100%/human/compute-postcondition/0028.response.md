Functionality: **The function processes an input consisting of n lines, where each line contains n characters representing transitions between scenarios. The diagonal elements are '.', indicating no transition is needed. At most \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor transition videos are already decided ('F' for funny or 'S' for scary), and the rest are undecided ('?'). The function determines the type of transition videos (funny or scary) for the undecided positions based on certain rules. If the number of undecided positions that have more 'F' decisions is greater than or equal to those with more 'S' decisions, it assigns 'F' to undecided positions unless they are in the first quarter of `sa`. Otherwise, it assigns 'S' to undecided positions unless they are in the first quarter of `sb`. The function prints the resulting transition videos for each scenario.**
