State: **`t` is 0, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is an empty list, `xx` is an empty list, `a` is a list of length `n+1`, `b` is a list of length `n+1`, `n` is the original input integer, `i` is 1**.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables: `i` and `n`.
2. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `t` is the number of indices `i` where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are 0. Initially, no such indices exist, so `t` is 0.
   - `sa` contains these indices. Initially, there are no such indices, so `sa` is an empty list.
   - `sb` is an empty list.
   - `xx` is a list of `n` strings received during each iteration of the loop. Initially, no strings are received, so `xx` is an empty list.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of length `n+1` with their original counts of 'F' and 'S' respectively. These lists are already defined and initialized with their original values.
   - `n` is the original input integer, which is already known.
3. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`. Therefore, initially, `i` should be set to 1 for the loop to start executing.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is `i` being set to 1, while all other states remain as they are initially defined.
