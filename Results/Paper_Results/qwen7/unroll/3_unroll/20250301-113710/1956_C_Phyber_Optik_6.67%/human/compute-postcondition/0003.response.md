Output State: The output will consist of `t` pairs of lines, each pair containing a sum and a number `n + r`. For each input `n`, it will also print a sequence of lines where the first line prints numbers from 1 to `n`, and subsequent lines alternate between printing numbers from 1 to `n` in order and repeating the first number based on the modulo operation with `n`.

To break it down further:
- For each input `n`, the loop calculates a sum and a value `r`.
- It then prints the sum and `n + r`.
- Following this, it prints a sequence of lines where the first line contains numbers from 1 to `n`. Subsequent lines alternate between printing numbers from 1 to `n` and repeating the first number based on the modulo operation with `n`.

This pattern will repeat `t` times based on the input integer `t`.
