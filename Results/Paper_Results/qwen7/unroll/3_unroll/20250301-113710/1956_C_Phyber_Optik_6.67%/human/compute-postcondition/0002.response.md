Output State: The output consists of multiple lines for each iteration of the outer loop. For each iteration, it prints two lines: 
1. The first line contains the value of `sum` and `n + r`.
2. The second line contains either a sequence of pairs indicating the first type of output or a sequence of pairs indicating the second type of output based on the value of `j`.

For each inner loop iteration:
- If `j` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints "1" followed by `j` and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.
- If `j` is greater than `n`, it prints "2" followed by `j % n` and then the numbers from 1 to `n`.

This pattern repeats for each value of `t` provided initially, with `t` ranging from 1 to 500.
