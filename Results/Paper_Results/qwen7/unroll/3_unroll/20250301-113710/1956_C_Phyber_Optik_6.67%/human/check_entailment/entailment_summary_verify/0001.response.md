### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations.
   - Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, the size of the matrix.
   - It calculates the sum and the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum possible sum.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated by iterating through the first \( r \) rows, where \( r \) is determined such that \( n(n+1)/2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is just greater than or equal to \( i \cdot n \).
   - If \( n(n+1)/2 > i \cdot n \), then \( r = i \). Otherwise, the sum is updated to include \( i \cdot n \).
   - The total sum is then printed along with the number of operations \( n + r \).

4. **Operations Execution**:
   - For the first \( n \) operations, it performs row permutations.
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it performs column permutations.
   - The permutations used are simply the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., n).

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic for determining the value of \( r \) seems correct because it ensures that the sum is maximized by filling the top-left triangular part of the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - However, the operations performed do not actually achieve the maximum sum. The code only prints the identity permutation, which does not change the matrix at all.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The code calculates the sum correctly, but the operations do not modify the matrix in any way. The identity permutation (1, 2, ..., n) is printed for both row and column operations, which means the matrix remains unchanged.
- To achieve the maximum sum, we need to fill the top-left triangular part of the matrix with the highest possible values. This requires swapping the appropriate elements to place the numbers 1 to \( n \) in the top-left triangular part of the matrix.

### Correct Solution:
- We need to perform row and column swaps to place the numbers 1 to \( n \) in the top-left triangular part of the matrix.
- For each row \( i \) from 1 to \( r \), swap the elements of row \( i \) with the elements of the corresponding column \( i \).
- For each column \( j \) from 1 to \( n \), swap the elements of column \( j \) with the elements of the corresponding row \( j \).

### Conclusion:
The provided solution does not perform the necessary operations to maximize the sum of the matrix. Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
