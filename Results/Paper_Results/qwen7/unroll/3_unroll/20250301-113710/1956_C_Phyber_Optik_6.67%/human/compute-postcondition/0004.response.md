Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 500) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 500). Additionally, the sum of `n^2` over all test cases does not exceed 5 × 10^5. For each test case, the function processes `t` and `n` and returns a result based on these values.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing two integers `t` and `n`, and ensure that the sum of `n^2` across all test cases does not exceed a certain limit. The exact nature of the return value (e.g., what it calculates or returns) is not specified in the given information.
