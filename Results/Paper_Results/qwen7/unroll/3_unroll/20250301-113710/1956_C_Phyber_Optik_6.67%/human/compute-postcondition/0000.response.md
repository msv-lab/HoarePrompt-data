Output State: **`t` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 500**.

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` takes an input from the user and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specified that `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500, and the input is within this range, the value of `t` is updated to the input integer. All other conditions and constraints remain valid.
