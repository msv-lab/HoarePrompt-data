Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the sum of the matrix. Specifically, the program calculates the sum and the number of operations incorrectly. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sum Calculation**: The program attempts to calculate the sum using a formula `n * (n + 1) // 2` and compares it with `i * n`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the actual operations needed to achieve the maximum sum.

2. **Operations Description**: The program prints operations that do not align with the problem's requirements. For instance, it prints operations in a way that does not reflect the actual permutations needed to maximize the sum. The operations should involve permuting rows or columns to fill the matrix with the highest possible values.

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example:

- **Input**: `n = 2`
- **Expected Output**: The maximum sum is `8`, and the operations should be:
  ```
  1 2 1 2
  1 1 2 1
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
8 4
1 1 1 2
1 2 1 2
1 1 2 1
2 1 1 2
```

This output does not match the expected operations and sum. The program incorrectly calculates the sum and does not provide the correct sequence of operations to achieve the maximum sum.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
