Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to maximize the sum of all elements in an \( n \times n \) matrix using at most \( 2n \) operations. Each operation can either permute the rows or columns of the matrix.

2. **Analyzing the Given Solution**:
   - The function `func()` takes an integer `t` which is the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads an integer `n`, the size of the matrix.
   - It calculates the sum and the number of operations needed to achieve the maximum possible sum.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum is calculated by iterating through the first \( r \) rows, where \( r \) is determined such that \( n(n+1)/2 \) (the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers) is just greater than or equal to \( i \cdot n \).
   - If \( n(n+1)/2 > i \cdot n \), then \( r = i \). Otherwise, the sum is updated to include \( i \cdot n \).
   - The total sum is then printed along with the number of operations \( n + r \).

4. **Operations Execution**:
   - For the first \( n \) operations, it performs row permutations.
   - For the remaining \( r \) operations, it performs column permutations.
   - The permutations used are simply the identity permutation (1, 2, ..., n).

5. **Verification**:
   - The logic for determining the value of \( r \) seems correct because it ensures that the sum is maximized by filling the top-left triangular part of the matrix with the highest possible values.
   - The operations performed ensure that the sum is maximized within the constraints.

Given the above analysis, the provided solution correctly maximizes the sum of the matrix and uses no more than \( 2n \) operations.

Correctness: **True**
