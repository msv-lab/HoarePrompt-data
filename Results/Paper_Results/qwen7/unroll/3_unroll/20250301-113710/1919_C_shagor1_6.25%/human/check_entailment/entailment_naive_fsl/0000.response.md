Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the logic for calculating the penalty is flawed. The program attempts to find the minimum penalty by maintaining two variables `x` and `y`, but it does not properly account for the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences `s` and `t`.

Let's consider an example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  5
  3
  1 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  0
  ```

- **Actual Output:**
  ```
  2
  ```

### Explanation:
- The program splits the array `[1, 2, 3]` into two subsequences. One possible optimal split is `s = [1, 2]` and `t = [3]`. Here, `p(s) = 1` (since `1 < 2`) and `p(t) = 0` (no increasing pair). Therefore, the total penalty should be `1 + 0 = 1`.

However, the program incorrectly calculates the penalty as `2` because it does not correctly handle the logic for counting the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences.

### Detailed Analysis:
- The program maintains two variables `x` and `y` to track the smallest and second smallest elements seen so far. It increments `ans` whenever it encounters an element greater than both `x` and `y`.
- This approach fails to correctly count the number of increasing pairs in the subsequences.

To correctly solve this problem, a more appropriate approach would involve sorting the array and then splitting it into two subsequences to minimize the penalty. However, the provided solution does not achieve this.
