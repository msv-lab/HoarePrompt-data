Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to split the array `a` into two subsequences `s` and `t`.
- The penalty `p(b)` for an array `b` is defined as the number of indices `i` where `b_i < b_{i+1}`.
- The goal is to minimize the total penalty `p(s) + p(t)`.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        (*inp,) = map(int, input().split())
        x = y = n + 1
        ans = 0
        for a in inp:
            if a <= x:
                x = a
            elif a <= y:
                y = a
            else:
                x == y  # This line is incorrect; it should be x = y and y = a
                y = a
                ans += 1
        print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Initialization**: The variables `x` and `y` are initialized to `n + 1`. These variables are used to keep track of the last seen values in the two subsequences `s` and `t`.

2. **Loop through the Input Array**: For each element `a` in the input array `inp`:
   - If `a` is less than or equal to `x`, update `x` to `a`.
   - Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `y`, update `y` to `a`.
   - If `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`, it means we need to start a new subsequence. However, the current line `x == y` is incorrect. It should be `x = y` and then `y = a` to ensure that the next comparison starts with the correct value for `y`.

3. **Increment Penalty**: Each time a new subsequence is started (i.e., when `a` is greater than both `x` and `y`), increment the penalty counter `ans`.

4. **Output the Result**: After processing all elements, print the total penalty `ans`.

### Correctness Check:
- The logic for splitting the array into two subsequences and counting the penalties is mostly correct.
- However, the line `x == y` is incorrect. It should be `x = y` and `y = a` to correctly handle the transition from one subsequence to another.

### Conclusion:
The given program has a logical error in the line `x == y`. This error causes the program to incorrectly count the penalties. Therefore, the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
