Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `os.system('cls')` has been called.**

The code `os.system('cls')` is used to clear the terminal or command prompt window. However, this does not change the value of any variables. It only affects the environment by clearing the screen. Therefore, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the operation `os.system('cls')` has been performed.
