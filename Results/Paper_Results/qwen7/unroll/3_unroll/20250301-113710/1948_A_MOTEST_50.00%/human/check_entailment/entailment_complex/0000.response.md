Reasoning:
1. The function correctly handles the input constraints, with `t` being the number of test cases and `n` being the required number of special characters in the string.
2. For each test case, the function checks if `n` is 1, in which case it prints "NO" since it's impossible to have a single special character.
3. For even values of `n`, the function constructs a string consisting of pairs of different uppercase letters, ensuring that each character is special (appears exactly once among its neighbors).
4. For odd values of `n`, the function starts with "AAA" and then adds pairs of different uppercase letters starting from 'C' to 'Z', ensuring that the total count of special characters matches `n`.
5. The constructed strings meet the criteria of having exactly `n` special characters, as defined in the problem statement.
6. The function handles the output format correctly, printing "YES" followed by the constructed string if applicable, and "NO" otherwise.

Given the above points, the annotated program accurately implements the logic specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
