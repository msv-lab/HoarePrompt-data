You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

    #State: Output State: The screen is cleared, then for each iteration of the loop, depending on the value of `n`, either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' up to half the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of characters from 'C' to 'Z' up to `n-3`. After all iterations, the final state of the screen displays the results of each iteration.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases (up to 50) where for each case, it reads an integer `n` (between 1 and 50). Depending on whether `n` is even or odd, it prints 'YES' followed by a specific string `ans`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of uppercase letters from 'A' to 'Z' up to half the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of letters from 'C' to 'Z' up to `n-3`. After processing all test cases, it clears the screen and outputs the results for each case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem as described.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program starts by clearing the console using `os.system('cls')`.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` from the input.
   - For each test case, it reads the value of `n`.

2. **Special Character Definition:**
   - A character is considered special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

3. **Generating the String:**
   - The program attempts to generate a string with exactly `n` special characters.
   - If `n` is 1, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to have exactly one special character in a string.
   - Otherwise, it tries to construct a string with the required number of special characters.

4. **String Construction Logic:**
   - If `n` is even, it constructs the string by repeating pairs of different characters.
   - If `n` is odd, it starts with 'AAA' and then continues constructing the string similarly.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - The program does not handle cases where `n` is greater than 50 or less than 1 properly.
   - It assumes that a solution exists for all valid `n`, but it doesn't check if a valid string can always be constructed.

### Detailed Analysis

#### Case 1: `n` is Even
- For example, if `n = 6`, the program constructs the string "AAABAACC".
  - This string has 6 special characters (positions: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8).
  - The logic seems to work for this case.

#### Case 2: `n` is Odd
- For example, if `n = 7`, the program constructs the string "AAAABBBCC".
  - This string has 6 special characters (positions: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8), which is close but not exactly 7.
  - The logic does not seem to work perfectly for odd `n`.

#### Case 3: `n = 1`
- The program correctly prints "NO" for `n = 1`.

#### General Validity
- The program does not handle all edge cases properly. For example, it might fail for larger values of `n` or specific patterns that do not fit the constructed strings.

### Conclusion

The program does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Specifically, it fails to generate the exact number of special characters for odd `n` and does not handle edge cases properly.
