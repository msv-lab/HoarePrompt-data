Output State: The screen is cleared, then for each iteration of the loop, depending on the value of `n`, either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' followed by a string `ans`. If `n` is even, `ans` consists of pairs of characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' up to half the value of `n`. If `n` is odd, `ans` starts with 'AAA' followed by pairs of characters from 'C' to 'Z' up to `n-3`. After all iterations, the final state of the screen displays the results of each iteration.
