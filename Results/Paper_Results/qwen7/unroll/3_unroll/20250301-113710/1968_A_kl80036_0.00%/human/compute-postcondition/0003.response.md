Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a test case where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and for each test case, `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000. The function returns a value based on the conditions provided for `x`.**

Given the constraints and relationships, the function processes a test case with two integers, `t` and `x`, where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, and `x` is an integer between 2 and 1000. However, the specific return value is not detailed in the provided output cases, so the primary focus is on the parameters implied by the constraints.
