You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

- Program: 
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ 1000.
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        y = x // 2
        
        print(y)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of a series of integers printed, where each integer is half of the corresponding input integer \(x\) for each test case. Specifically, if there are \(t\) test cases, the output will be a list of \(t\) integers, each being the result of \(x_i // 2\) for \(i\) from 1 to \(t\).



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis:
- The goal is to find an integer \( y \) such that \( 1 \leq y < x \) and the value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \) is maximized.
- The input consists of multiple test cases, each with an integer \( x \).
- For each \( x \), we need to output any \( y \) that satisfies the condition.

### Given Program Analysis:
```python
def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        y = x // 2
        print(y)
```

#### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases \( t \) from the first line.
   - It then iterates over each test case, reading the value of \( x \) for each test case.

2. **Finding \( y \)**:
   - For each \( x \), the program sets \( y \) to \( x // 2 \). This means \( y \) is the integer division of \( x \) by 2.
   - The program then prints \( y \).

3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - We need to check if \( y = x // 2 \) always results in the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).
   - Consider the example where \( x = 10 \):
     - If \( y = 5 \), then \( \gcd(10, 5) + 5 = 5 + 5 = 10 \).
     - However, if \( y = 1 \), then \( \gcd(10, 1) + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
     - Clearly, \( y = 5 \) does not necessarily maximize \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

4. **General Case**:
   - For \( x = 2k \) (even), \( y = k \) might not be optimal.
   - For \( x = 2k + 1 \) (odd), \( y = k \) might also not be optimal.
   - A better approach would be to consider \( y = 1 \) or other values that maximize the gcd.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The program does not guarantee finding the maximum possible value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \). It simply uses \( y = x // 2 \), which is not always optimal.

### Final Answer:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly solve the problem as it does not ensure the maximum value of \( \gcd(x, y) + y \).

**Correctness: False**
