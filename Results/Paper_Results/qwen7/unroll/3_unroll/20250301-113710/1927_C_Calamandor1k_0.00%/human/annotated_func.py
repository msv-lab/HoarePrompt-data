#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2⋅10^5, and k is an even integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅min(n, m). Each test case consists of two arrays a and b, where a has n integers and b has m integers, and each integer in both arrays is between 1 and 10^6 inclusive.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        len_a, len_b = len(a), len(b)
        
        count_a, count_b = 0, 0
        
        d = k // 2
        
        for i in range(max(len_a, len_b)):
            if len_a > i + 1:
                if a[i] <= k:
                    count_a += 1
            if len_b > i + 1:
                if b[i] <= k:
                    count_b += 1
        
        print('YES' if count_a >= d and count_b >= d else 'NO')
        
    #State: Output State: The value of `t` is reduced to 0 after all iterations of the loop have finished. For each iteration, the loop processes three lists (`a`, `b`, and implicitly `input` values) and prints 'YES' or 'NO' based on certain conditions, but does not modify these lists or any external variables. The variable `t` is decremented by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two arrays `a` and `b` along with integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. It counts how many elements in `a` and `b` are less than or equal to `k/2`. If the count of such elements in both arrays meets or exceeds `k/2`, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. After processing all test cases, it outputs nothing further and terminates.
