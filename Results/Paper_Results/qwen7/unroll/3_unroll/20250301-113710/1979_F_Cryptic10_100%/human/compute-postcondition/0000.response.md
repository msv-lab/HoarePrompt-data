Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for each test case, `q` is a lambda function that prints '? %d' % d followed by reading a line of input and splitting it into integers, and the input is processed using this function.**

The code defines a lambda function `q` that prints a query in the format `? %d` followed by the value of `d`, and then reads a line of input and splits it into integers. However, the actual values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. The lambda function itself is assigned to the variable `q`.
