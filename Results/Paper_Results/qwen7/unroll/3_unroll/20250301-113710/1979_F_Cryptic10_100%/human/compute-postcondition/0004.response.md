Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and performs a series of operations to transform a set of numbers into two permutations, `p1` and `p2`. The function then prints the final permutations `p1` and `p2` along with the operations that were applied to generate them. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
