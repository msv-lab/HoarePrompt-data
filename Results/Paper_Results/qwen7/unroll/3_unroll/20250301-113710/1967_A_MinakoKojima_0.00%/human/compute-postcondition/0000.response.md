Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The variables involved here are:
   - `_`: A placeholder variable used to iterate over the range returned by `int(input())`.
   - `input()`: This function call reads input from the user.

2. **Determine the necessary adjustments**: Since the loop will execute based on the input provided by `int(input())`, the key state to adjust is the value returned by `int(input())`. This value determines how many times the loop will run.

3. **Initial state before the loop**: The initial state is given as:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\).
   - For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\).
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12}\).

4. **Adjusting the state**: To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that the input to `int(input())` is within the valid range for `t`. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `t` is indeed an integer between 1 and 100.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\)**

This ensures that the loop will execute the correct number of times based on the input value of `t`.
