You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. For each test case, it first finds the minimum element `m` in the list `a`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, it calculates the factorial of `n`. Otherwise, it adjusts the list `a` based on `k` and `m`, then computes the product of the differences between consecutive elements in the modified list `a`. Finally, it prints the computed value for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`, followed by the list `a` of size `n`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `m` is set to the minimum value in the list `a`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 0.

3. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * m`, the program calculates the factorial of `n` and assigns it to `ans`. This is because we can buy enough cards to ensure every subarray of length `n` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

4. **Adjustment for Remaining Coins**:
   - If `k` is less than `n * m`, the program adjusts the counts in the list `a` to maximize the number of valid subarrays.
   - It subtracts `n * m` from `k` since we can use up to `n * m` coins to buy the minimum cards needed.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to `n-1`, it updates the count `a[i]` to `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` and decreases `k` accordingly.

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - After adjustments, `ans` is set to `a[0]`.
   - For each subsequent index `i` from 1 to `n-1`, `ans` is multiplied by `a[i] - a[i - 1]`.

### Correctness Check:

1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - If `k` is sufficient to buy all minimum cards (`k >= n * m`), the program correctly calculates the factorial of `n`, which is the maximum possible score.

2. **Adjustment Logic**:
   - The adjustment logic ensures that we use the remaining coins optimally to increase the number of valid subarrays.
   - The formula `m + min(k, m + k // n - a[i])` ensures that we distribute the remaining coins to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

3. **Final Score Calculation**:
   - The final score calculation correctly multiplies the differences between consecutive adjusted counts to get the total number of valid subarrays.

### Conclusion:

The program correctly handles all aspects of the problem statement and logic. Therefore, the given program is correct.

### Final Answer:

Correctness: **True**
