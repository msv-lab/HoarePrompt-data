Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer `t` where 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, it accepts two integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 10^12, along with a list `a` of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^12. The function processes these inputs and returns a value based on the given constraints and relationships.**

This means the function `func` takes an integer `t` which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It then performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a result.
