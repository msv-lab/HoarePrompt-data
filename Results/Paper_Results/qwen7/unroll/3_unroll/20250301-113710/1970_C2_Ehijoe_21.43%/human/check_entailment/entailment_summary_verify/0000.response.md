### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step using the provided function summary and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function calculates the distances from the starting node to all other nodes in the tree.
   - It uses a recursive approach to traverse the tree and collect distances.
   - The function returns a list of distances from the starting node to all other nodes.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function constructs the tree from the given edges.
   - It identifies all leaf nodes and stores them in a deque.
   - It calls `func_1` to get the distances from the specified starting node to all other nodes.
   - It checks if any of these distances are odd.
     - If any distance is odd, it prints 'Ron'.
     - Otherwise, it prints 'Hermione'.

Given the problem description, the game is played optimally by both players. The key insight here is that the game is essentially a combinatorial game theory problem where the parity of the distance from the starting node to other nodes plays a crucial role.

- **Parity Analysis**:
  - In combinatorial game theory, the concept of "nim-sum" or "parity" is often used to determine the winner.
  - For a tree, if the distance from the starting node to any other node is odd, it means that the player whose turn it is can force a win by making a move to an even distance node.
  - Conversely, if all distances are even, the player whose turn it is will eventually be forced into a position where they cannot make a move, thus losing the game.

The provided code correctly identifies the distances and checks if any of them are odd. If any distance is odd, it implies that Ron can always make a move to an even distance node, ensuring his victory. If all distances are even, Hermione can force Ron into a losing position.

Therefore, the provided code correctly implements the logic to determine the winner based on the parity of the distances.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **True**

The given program is correct according to the problem description and the provided function summary. The code accurately determines the winner based on the optimal strategy of the game.
