You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, t is an integer such that t = 1, edges is a list of tuples representing the edges of the tree, each tuple (u, v) indicates an undirected edge between nodes u and v, start is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, and moves is a list of integers representing the sequence of moves made by the players during the game.
def func_2():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    edges = []
    empty = True
    nodes = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        u, v = map(int, input().split())
        
        nodes[u].append(v)
        
        nodes[v].append(u)
        
    #State: Output State: `empty` is False, `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` is an empty list, `start` is an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each pair (u, v) entered through input during the loop, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u`.
    leaves = deque()
    for key in nodes:
        if len(nodes[key]) == 1:
            leaves.append(key)
        
    #State: Output State: `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes (nodes with exactly one connection), `empty` is False, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` remains an empty list, `start` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list, and for each pair (u, v) entered through input during the loop, `nodes[u]` contains `v` and `nodes[v]` contains `u`.
    start = int(input())
    moves = func_1(nodes, start)
    if any([(move % 2 == 1) for move in moves]) :
        print('Ron')
        #This is printed: Ron
    else :
        print('Hermione')
        #This is printed: 'Hermione'
    #State: Postcondition: `moves` is the result of `func_1(nodes, start)`, `leaves` is a deque containing all the leaf nodes, `empty` is False, `n` remains an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 2×10^5, `t` is 1, `edges` remains an empty list, `start` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ start ≤ n, `nodes` is a defaultdict where the default factory is list. If there exists at least one move in `moves` that is odd, `moves` remains unchanged. Otherwise, all moves in `moves` are even numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts parameters n, t, edges, start, and moves, and does not return any specific value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
