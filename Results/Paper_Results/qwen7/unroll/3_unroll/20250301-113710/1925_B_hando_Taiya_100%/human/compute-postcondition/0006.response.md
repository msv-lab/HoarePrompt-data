Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes values within a series of test cases where `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. The function returns a result based on these values for each test case.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any direct parameters but operates over a set of test cases defined by the variables `t`, `x`, and `n`, where `t` represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, `x` and `n` are integers with specific ranges. The function processes these values and returns a result for each test case.
