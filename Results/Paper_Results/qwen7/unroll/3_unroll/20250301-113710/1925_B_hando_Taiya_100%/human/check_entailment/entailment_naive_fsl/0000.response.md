Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the maximum balance of the problemset. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the maximum balance. Specifically, the program checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i` and `i`, but it does not ensure that the GCD of the difficulties is maximized. 

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  3
  12 3
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  4
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

In this case, the optimal way to break up the problem of difficulty 12 into 3 sub-problems is to have difficulties 4, 4, and 4, which gives a GCD of 4. However, the program incorrectly outputs 3 because it checks `n <= x // i` and `n <= i` without ensuring the GCD is maximized.

The correct approach would involve finding the largest divisor of `x` that can be evenly divided among `n` sub-problems, ensuring the GCD is maximized.
