Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`tc`) and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `x` and `n` and calculates the maximum balance as defined in the problem statement.
3. The logic inside `func_1()` is designed to find the maximum balance by iterating through possible divisors of `x` and checking the conditions specified in the problem.
4. The function correctly updates `ans` with the maximum value found during the iteration.
5. The program prints the result for each test case as required.

Given the above points, the annotated program appears to be correct and follows the problem specification accurately.

Correctness: **True**
