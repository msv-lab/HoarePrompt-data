Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case one by one.
2. For each test case, the program converts the input string into a list of characters.
3. The function `func_1()` iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats, starting from the largest possible length down to 1.
4. For each length, it checks substrings to see if they meet the conditions for being a tandem repeat (each character either matches the corresponding character in the mirrored position or is a question mark).
5. If a valid tandem repeat is found, it prints the length of the tandem repeat (which is twice the count) and returns, ensuring only the longest valid tandem repeat is considered.
6. If no valid tandem repeat is found after checking all possible lengths, it prints 0.
7. The logic and implementation in `func_1()` align with the problem statement and the expected output.

Given the above points, the program appears to be logically sound and correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
