Let's analyze the provided program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem:

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1()`**:
   - It reads the string `s` as a list of characters.
   - It calculates the length of the string `n`.
   - It iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats in reverse order (from `n//2` down to 1).
   - For each possible length `j`, it checks all possible starting positions `k` for a tandem repeat of length `j`.
   - It uses a counter `count` to check if the current pair of characters at positions `k` and `k+j` can form part of a tandem repeat.
     - If either character is a `?`, it counts it as matching.
     - If both characters match, it increments the count.
     - If the count reaches `j`, it prints `j * 2` and returns, indicating a valid tandem repeat of length `j * 2` has been found.
   - If no tandem repeat is found, it prints `0`.

### Key Points to Verify

1. **Tandem Repeat Check**:
   - The logic to check for tandem repeats seems correct. It handles the `?` characters appropriately by counting them as matches.
   - The loop structure ensures that all possible tandem repeat lengths are checked from the largest to the smallest, which is efficient.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program correctly handles strings with no tandem repeats by printing `0`.
   - It correctly handles strings with `?` characters by treating them as wildcards that can match any character.

3. **Output**:
   - The output is the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring, which is calculated correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution for the problem. It checks for the longest possible tandem repeat by iterating over all possible lengths and using the wildcard characters (`?`) effectively.

### Final Answer

Correctness: **True**
