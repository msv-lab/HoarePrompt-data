Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and returns a string of length n (where 3 <= n <= 3*10^5) consisting only of '0' and '1'.**

This means the function `func_1` does not take any parameters but generates and returns a string where each character is either '0' or '1', and the length of the string falls within the range from 3 to 300,000 inclusive.
