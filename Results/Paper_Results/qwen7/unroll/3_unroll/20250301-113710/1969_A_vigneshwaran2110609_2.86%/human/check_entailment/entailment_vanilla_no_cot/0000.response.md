Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here’s why:

1. **Logic Error**: The program attempts to find a pair where `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`, which means it checks if a friend's best friend is also their best friend. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks one specific condition and breaks out of the loop immediately upon finding any such pair, even if no suitable pairs exist.

2. **Minimum Invitations Calculation**: The program tries to print `2` if such a pair exists and `3` otherwise. This logic is incorrect because:
   - If there is a pair where both friends invite each other, inviting just these two friends is sufficient.
   - If no such direct pair exists, the program incorrectly assumes that three friends need to be invited. However, the problem requires at least 2 friends to attend, and the solution should find the minimum number of invitations needed to achieve this.

3. **Test Case Analysis**:
   - For the first test case (`p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`), the correct answer should be `2` (inviting friends 4 and 5), but the program might incorrectly print `3`.
   - For the second test case (`p = [2, 3, 4, 1]`), the correct answer should be `3`, but the program might incorrectly handle this scenario.
   - For the third test case (`p = [2, 1]`), the correct answer is `2`, but the program might incorrectly print `3`.

To fix the program, you need to correctly identify cycles and ensure the minimum number of invitations is calculated accurately. Here’s a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        l = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
        
        # Find cycles
        visited = [False] * n
        cycle_length = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not visited[i]:
                j = i
                while not visited[j]:
                    visited[j] = True
                    j = l[j] - 1
                cycle_length += 1
        
        # Calculate minimum invitations
        if cycle_length >= 2:
            print(2)  # At least one cycle of length 2 or more
        else:
            print(3)  # Otherwise, need to invite at least 3 friends

func()
```

This version correctly identifies cycles and calculates the minimum number of invitations needed to ensure at least 2 friends attend the party.
