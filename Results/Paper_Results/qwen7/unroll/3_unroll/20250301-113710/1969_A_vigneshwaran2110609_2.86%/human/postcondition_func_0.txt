The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and does not equal its index. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if any element `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`. If such an element exists, it prints '2' and breaks out of the inner loop. If no such element is found, it prints '3'. The function does not return any value but outputs a series of '2's and '3's corresponding to the results of the loop's conditions for each test case.
