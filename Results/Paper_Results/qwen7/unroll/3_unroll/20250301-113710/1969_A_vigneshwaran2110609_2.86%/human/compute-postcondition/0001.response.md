Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.
2. **Determine the initial values needed for the loop to execute**: 
   - The variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`. Therefore, initially, `i` should be set to 0.
   - The variable `n` determines the number of iterations the loop will perform. Since the loop will run for each value of `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `n` must be a positive integer within the given range (2 ≤ n ≤ 50).

Given these points, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n` to ensure the loop can execute.

**State after adjustment**:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be a value between 2 and 50 (inclusive).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50**.
