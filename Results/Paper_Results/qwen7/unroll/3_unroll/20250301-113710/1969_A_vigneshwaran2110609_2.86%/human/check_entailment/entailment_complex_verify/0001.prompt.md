You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Monocarp wants to throw a party. He has n friends, and he wants to have at
least 2 of them at his party.

The i -th friend's best friend is p_i . All p_i are distinct, and for every i
\in [1, n] , p_i \ne i .

Monocarp can send invitations to friends. The i -th friend comes to the party
if both the i -th friend and the p_i -th friend receive an invitation (note
that the p_i -th friend doesn't have to actually come to the party). Each
invitation is sent to exactly one of the friends.

For example, if p = [3, 1, 2, 5, 4] , and Monocarp sends invitations to the
friends [1, 2, 4, 5] , then the friends [2, 4, 5] will come to the party. The
friend 1 won't come since his best friend didn't receive an invitation; the
friend 3 won't come since he didn't receive an invitation.

Calculate the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send so that at
least 2  friends come to the party.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 5000 ) — the number of test
cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

  * the first line contains one integer n (2 \le n \le 50 ) — the number of friends; 
  * the second line contains n integers p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n (1 \le p_i \le n ; p_i \ne i ; all p_i are distinct). 

Output

Print one integer — the minimum number of invitations Monocarp has to send.

Example

Input

    3
    
    5
    
    3 1 2 5 4
    
    4
    
    2 3 4 1
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    3
    2
    
Note

In the first testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 4 and 5 . Both
of them will come to the party since they are each other's best friends, and
both of them have invitations.

In the second testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to friends 1, 2 and 3 ,
for example. Then friends 1 and 2 will attend: friend 1 and his best friend 2
have invitations, friend 2 and his best friend 3 have invitations. Friend 3
won't attend since his friend 4 doesn't have an invitation. It's impossible to
send invitations to fewer than 3 friends in such a way that at least 2 come.

In the third testcase, Monocarp can send invitations to both friends 1 and 2 ,
and both of them will attend.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct.

    #State: Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, and p is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, the output consists of either '2' or '3' printed for each iteration based on the condition inside the inner loop.
    #
    #In more detail, for each iteration of the outer loop (i.e., for each element in the list `p`), the code reads two lines of input: an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if any element `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`. If such an element exists, it prints '2' and breaks out of the inner loop. Otherwise, it prints '3'. The final output state remains unchanged in terms of the values of `t`, `n`, and `p`, but the output will contain a series of '2's and '3's corresponding to the results of the loop's conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), and a list `p` of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` and does not equal its index. For each test case, it reads an integer `x` and a list `l` of integers. It then checks if any element `l[l[i] - 1]` equals `l[i] - 1`. If such an element exists, it prints '2' and breaks out of the inner loop. If no such element is found, it prints '3'. The function does not return any value but outputs a series of '2's and '3's corresponding to the results of the loop's conditions for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness based on the problem description.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of friends.
   - For each test case, it reads another integer `x` (which should be `n`), but this is not used in the logic.
   - It then reads a list of integers `l` where `l[i]` is the best friend of the `i+1`-th friend.

2. **Finding a Pair of Best Friends:**
   - The program iterates through the list `l` to find any index `i` such that `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1`.
   - If such an index is found, it prints `2` and breaks out of the loop, indicating that sending invitations to these two friends will ensure both come to the party.
   - If no such pair is found, it prints `3`.

3. **Checking the Logic:**
   - The problem requires finding the minimum number of invitations needed so that at least 2 friends come to the party.
   - The logic to check for a pair of best friends who are also each other's best friends is correct.
   - However, the program incorrectly reads `x` instead of `n` and does not handle the case where no such pair exists correctly.

### Example Analysis

1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `5`
   - List: `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`
   - The correct output should be `2` because friends 4 and 5 are each other's best friends.
   - The program correctly identifies this pair and prints `2`.

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `4`
   - List: `[2, 3, 4, 1]`
   - The correct output should be `3` because there is no pair of best friends who are also each other's best friends. Invitations must be sent to at least three friends to ensure at least two come.
   - The program incorrectly prints `2` because it reads `x` instead of `n`.

3. **Example 3:**
   - Input: `2`
   - List: `[2, 1]`
   - The correct output should be `2` because friends 1 and 2 are each other's best friends.
   - The program correctly identifies this pair and prints `2`.

### Conclusion

The program is incorrect because it reads `x` instead of `n` and does not handle the case where no such pair exists correctly. This leads to incorrect outputs in some cases.
