Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case includes integers n and m, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. For each test case, it checks if the given conditions (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^6, and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) are met and returns a result based on these conditions.**

This means the function processes multiple test cases, each containing specific integers and a list of integers, ensuring they meet certain criteria and then returning a result based on those conditions.
