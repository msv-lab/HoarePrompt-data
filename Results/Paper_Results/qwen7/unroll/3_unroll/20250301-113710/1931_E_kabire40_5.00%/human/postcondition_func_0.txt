The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of integers \(n\) and \(m\), and a list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\). For each test case, it reverses each integer in the list, sorts the reversed integers, and then constructs a new string by alternating between non-same-length and same-length reversed integers. Finally, it compares \(10^{max\_power}\) with the constructed string and prints 'Sasha' if \(10^{max\_power}\) is less than the string, otherwise it prints 'Anna'.
