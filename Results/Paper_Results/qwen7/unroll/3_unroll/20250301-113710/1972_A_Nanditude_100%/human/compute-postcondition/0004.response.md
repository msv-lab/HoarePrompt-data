Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it accepts a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 100), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), and two lists `a` and `b` of length `n` where both lists are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns a result based on the comparison of elements in lists `a` and `b`.**

This means the function processes a series of test cases, each containing a value `t`, an integer `n`, and two lists `a` and `b`. The lists `a` and `b` are of the same length `n` and contain integers in non-decreasing order. The function then compares the elements of these lists and returns a result based on these comparisons.
