Output State: **`t` is an input integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.**

Explanation: The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 100`, the value of `t` remains within this range after the input is taken. All other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their initial conditions as described in the precondition.
