Output State: The value of `t` will be decremented by 1 after each iteration of the outer loop. For each inner loop iteration, `cnt` will be updated based on the comparison between elements of lists `a` and `b`. The final value of `cnt` for each test case will be printed, and this process will repeat `t` times. After all iterations, `t` will be 0, and `cnt` will hold the cumulative count of mismatches across all test cases.
