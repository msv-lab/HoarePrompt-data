Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case includes a positive integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5), and a list of `n` non-negative integers. For each test case, it returns a result based on the given trace list.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each containing specific parameters `t`, `n`, and a list called `trace`. The function does not accept any parameters itself but uses these parameters within its processing logic to produce the desired output for each test case.
