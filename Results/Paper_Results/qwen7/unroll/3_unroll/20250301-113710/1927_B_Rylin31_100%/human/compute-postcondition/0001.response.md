Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, and the trace is a list of n non-negative integers where each integer a_i satisfies 0 ≤ a_i < n. After executing the loop, ans is a string constructed by iterating through the input array, where each character is determined by the value of `s[j]` (initially set to 0 for all indices) plus 97, converted to a corresponding lowercase letter, and then incrementing `s[j]` by 1 for each occurrence of `j`.
