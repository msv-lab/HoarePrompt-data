Correctness: **False**

The provided Python function `func()` does not correctly solve the problem for all cases. Here are the issues:

1. **Handling Single Character Strings**: The function correctly handles single character strings by printing "NO", but the logic can be simplified.
2. **General Partition Logic**: The function attempts to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings, but the logic is flawed. It does not properly check all possible partitions and can miss valid partitions.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function does not handle all edge cases, such as strings with repeated characters in a way that allows for valid partitions.

### Example of Incorrect Handling:
- For the input `"sinktheyacht"`, the function correctly outputs "YES" and the entire string as a single partition.
- For the input `"llllllll"`, the function incorrectly outputs "NO" because it does not consider the possibility of splitting the string into smaller non-palindromic parts.
- For the input `"uwuowouwu"`, the function should output "YES" with a valid partition like `["uw", "uow", "ouwu"]`, but it does not handle this case correctly.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, you should:
1. Check if the string is a single character or a palindrome and handle these cases directly.
2. For longer strings, try to find the smallest non-palindromic substring and use it to split the rest of the string.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        string = input().strip()
        n = len(string)
        
        # Check if the string is a single character or a palindrome
        if n == 1 or string == string[::-1]:
            print("NO")
            continue
        
        # Try to find a non-palindromic substring
        for j in range(n):
            for k in range(j + 2, n + 1):
                if string[j:k] != string[j:k][::-1]:
                    print("YES")
                    print(2)
                    print(string[:j], string[j:k])
                    break
            else:
                continue
            break
        else:
            print("NO")

# Example usage
func()
```

This approach checks for the smallest non-palindromic substring and tries to partition the string accordingly. If no valid partition is found, it prints "NO".
