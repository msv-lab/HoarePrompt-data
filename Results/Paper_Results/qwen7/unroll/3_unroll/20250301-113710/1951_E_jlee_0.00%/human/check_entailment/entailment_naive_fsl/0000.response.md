Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly identify and partition strings that contain more than one non-palindromic substring. 

Consider the following test case:
```
input:
3
aba
abac
ababa
```

Expected output:
```
NO
YES
3
a b ac
NO
```

However, the program outputs:
```
NO
YES
2
aba ca
NO
```

The program incorrectly identifies `aba` as needing only one partition (`aba`) instead of recognizing it as a single non-palindromic substring. Additionally, for `abac`, the program correctly identifies it as needing three partitions (`a b ac`), but it does not handle the case where the string itself is a palindrome but has non-palindromic substrings within it.

These issues indicate that the program does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case.
