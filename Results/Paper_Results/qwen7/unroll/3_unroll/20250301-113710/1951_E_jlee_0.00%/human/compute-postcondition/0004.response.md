Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a test case where `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters with a length between 1 and 10^6. For each test case, it returns a result based on the string `s`.**

This means the function is designed to handle multiple test cases, each defined by an integer `t` and a string `s`. It processes each string `s` according to its specified constraints and returns a result for each case.
