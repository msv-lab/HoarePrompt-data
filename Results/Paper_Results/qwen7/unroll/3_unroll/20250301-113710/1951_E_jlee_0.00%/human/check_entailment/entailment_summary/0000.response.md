Reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func()` aims to check if a string can be partitioned into substrings such that none of these substrings form a palindrome.
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Single character strings (`n == 1`) should always return 'NO' because a single character is a palindrome.
   - Strings where all characters are the same (`s.count(x) == n`) should also return 'NO'.
   - Strings where all but one character are the same (`s.count(x) == n - 1`) need special handling:
     - If the length is odd and the middle character is different from `x`, it should return 'NO'.
     - Otherwise, it should return 'YES' with a single partition.
3. **Main Logic**:
   - The function iterates through the string to find the first mismatch between characters at symmetric positions.
   - If such a mismatch is found, it prints 'YES' and the entire string as a single partition.
   - If no such mismatch is found, it checks for other possible partitions.
4. **Handling Specific Conditions**:
   - The function correctly handles the cases where the string can be split into two non-palindromic substrings.
   - It also correctly identifies when a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

Given the execution summary and the provided examples, the function appears to handle all cases correctly according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
