The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` and a string `s`. For each test case, it checks specific conditions related to the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if the conditions are met. If the string `s` meets certain criteria, it also prints the positions or substrings involved. The function does not return any value but produces output for each test case based on the given string `s`.
