Reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
2. For each test case, it reads the length `n` and the strings `a`, `b`, and `c`.
3. It then iterates through each character position `i` from `0` to `n-1` and checks the conditions specified in the problem statement:
   - If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is not equal to `a[i]`, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
   - If `a[i]` is not equal to `b[i]` and `c[i]` is either equal to `a[i]` or `b[i]`, it continues to the next iteration.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it sets `possible` to `True` and breaks out of the loop.
4. After checking all positions, if `possible` is still `False`, it prints 'NO'; otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
5. The logic implemented in the program correctly follows the problem statement and handles all the given examples.

Given the above reasoning, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided test cases.

Correctness: **True**
