Correctness: **False**

### Explanation:
The provided program has a logical flaw in determining whether a template exists. Specifically, the logic for checking if a template can exist is incorrect. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Logic for `possible` Variable:**
   - The current implementation sets `possible` to `True` if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and `c[i]` is different from both.
   - However, this does not guarantee that a valid template can be constructed because it only checks one condition at a time and does not ensure consistency across all positions.

2. **Template Construction Requirement:**
   - To correctly determine if a template exists, we need to check if for every position `i`, either:
     - Both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, and `c[i]` is different.
     - Or, `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, and `c[i]` can be either `a[i]` or `b[i]`.

3. **Correct Approach:**
   - We should iterate through each character and ensure that if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same, `c[i]` must be different. If `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different, `c[i]` must match one of them but not both.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        c = input().strip()
        
        # Check if a and b have the same character at each position where c differs
        possible = True
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] != b[i]:
                if c[i] == a[i] or c[i] == b[i]:
                    continue
                else:
                    possible = False
                    break
            elif a[i] == b[i]:
                if c[i] != a[i]:
                    possible = False
                    break
        
        if possible:
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')

func_1()
```

This corrected version ensures that the template conditions are properly checked and guarantees the correct output based on the problem statement.
