Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to determine if there exists a template `t` such that strings `a` and `b` match it, while string `c` does not. Specifically, the program checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`. However, this logic is insufficient because it does not account for the case where `a[i]` and `b[i]` are different but `c[i]` could still match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` depending on their case.

For example, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  acc
  abd
  abc
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  YES
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  NO
  ```

In this case, the program incorrectly returns "NO" because it only checks if `a[i]` and `b[i]` are the same and if `c[i]` is different from `a[i]`, without considering the possibility that `c[i]` could match either `a[i]` or `b[i]` if they are different. A correct implementation would need to handle this scenario appropriately.
