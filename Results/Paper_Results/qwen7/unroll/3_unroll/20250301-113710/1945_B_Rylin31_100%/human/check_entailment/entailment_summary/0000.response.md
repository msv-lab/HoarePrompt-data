Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time. However, there's a flaw in the logic used to calculate this value.

The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is an overestimation of the actual maximum number of fireworks that could be seen simultaneously. This formula counts the number of times fireworks from each installation would be visible within the visibility period \(m\), but it does not account for the exact overlap of fireworks from both installations.

To correctly determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\), which represents the interval at which fireworks from both installations coincide. The correct approach involves calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of \(a\) and \(b\), using it to find the LCM, and then determining how many fireworks can be seen at any given moment.

Given the provided solution, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not accurately represent the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
