Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a set of test cases where each test case consists of three integers a, b, and m. For each test case, if 1 ≤ a, b, m ≤ 10^{18} and 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, it performs some operation (not specified here) and returns the result. If any of the conditions are not met, it handles the error accordingly.**
