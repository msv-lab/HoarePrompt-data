Reasoning:
The annotated program provided appears to be attempting to solve the problem correctly. However, there is a logical error in the formula used to calculate the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously. The formula `m // a + m // b + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the overlap of fireworks from both installations. 

To find the correct solution, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. The correct formula should be:

\[ \text{max\_visible} = \left(\frac{m}{a}\right) + \left(\frac{m}{b}\right) - \left(\frac{m}{\text{lcm}(a, b)}\right) + 1 \]

Where lcm(a, b) is the least common multiple of a and b. This formula accounts for the overlaps correctly.

Given the provided code, the formula `m // a + m // b + 2` does not correctly implement the inclusion-exclusion principle and thus will produce incorrect results for most cases.

Therefore, the provided program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
