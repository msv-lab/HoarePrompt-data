You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
n = int(input())
for i in range(n):
    print(func_1())

def func_1():
    ma = mi = 0
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    c = d = 0
    l = []
    for j in s:
        c += 1
        if j == 'B':
            mi = c
            break
    for j in s[::-1]:
        d += 1
        if j == 'B':
            ma = len(s) - d
            break
    return ma - mi + 2



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a string `s` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where at least one character is 'B'. It calculates the distance from the end of the string to the last occurrence of 'B' and returns this distance plus 2. The function does not accept any parameters and reads `m` and `s` from input.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it calls `func_1()`.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` is supposed to calculate the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white.
   - It reads an integer `m` which is the length of the strip.
   - It reads a string `s` representing the initial state of the strip where 'W' is white and 'B' is black.
   - It initializes `c` and `d` to count the positions of the first and last black cells, respectively.
   - It uses two loops:
     - The first loop (`for j in s:`) counts the position of the first black cell and breaks the loop.
     - The second loop (`for j in s[::-1]:`) counts the position of the last black cell from the end and breaks the loop.
   - It calculates `ma` as the distance from the end of the strip to the last black cell (`len(s) - d`).
   - It calculates `mi` as the distance from the start of the strip to the first black cell (`c`).
   - Finally, it returns `ma - mi + 2`.

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation:**
   - The calculation `ma - mi + 2` is incorrect because it does not account for the actual span of the segment needed to cover all black cells.
   - For example, if the strip is "WBBWBW" and the first black cell is at position 2 and the last black cell is at position 5, the correct answer should be 4 (span from 2 to 5), but the program incorrectly computes `len(s) - 2 - 2 + 2 = 4 - 2 + 2 = 4`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there is only one black cell, the program correctly identifies the position of this cell, but it still adds 2, which is unnecessary.
   - If there are no black cells, the program should return 1, but it will return 2 due to the `+2` in the formula.

### Correct Approach:

To find the minimum length of the segment, we need to identify the first and last black cells and calculate the distance between them. If there are no black cells, the entire strip is already white, so the answer is 1.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1():
    m = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    
    if first_black == -1:  # No black cells
        return 1
    else:
        return last_black - first_black + 1
```

### Conclusion:

Given the issues with the original program, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the final answer is:

Correctness: **False**
