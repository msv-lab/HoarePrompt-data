Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment that needs to be painted white so that all cells become white.
2. The annotated program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically:
   - The function `func_1()` does not account for the presence of multiple 'B's (black cells) in the string `s`.
   - The logic for determining the minimum segment length is flawed. The current implementation only considers the distance from the start and end of the string to the first 'B' it encounters, but it does not consider the possibility of multiple 'B's within the string.
   - The formula `return ma - mi + 2` does not correctly calculate the minimum segment length needed to turn all cells white.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
