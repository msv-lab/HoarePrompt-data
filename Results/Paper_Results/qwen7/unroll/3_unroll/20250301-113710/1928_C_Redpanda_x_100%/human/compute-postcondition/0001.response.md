Output State: **`factors` is an empty dictionary, `nn` is equal to `n`.**

Explanation: The code `nn = n` assigns the value of `n` to the variable `nn`. The initial state of `factors` as an empty dictionary remains unchanged. Therefore, `factors` is still an empty dictionary, and `nn` now holds the value of `n`.
