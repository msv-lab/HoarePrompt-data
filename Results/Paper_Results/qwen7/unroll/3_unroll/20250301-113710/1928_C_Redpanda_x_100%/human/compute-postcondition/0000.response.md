Output State: **`factors` is an empty dictionary.**

The code initializes an empty dictionary named `factors`. No other variables are affected, and the precondition that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\) remains unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the creation and initialization of the `factors` dictionary.
