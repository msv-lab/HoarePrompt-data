Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the following variables:
   - `_`: This is a placeholder variable used in the `for` loop to iterate over the range specified by `int(input())`.

2. **Understand the Loop Execution Condition**: The loop will execute as long as there are values generated by `int(input())`. Each call to `input()` returns an integer, and the loop continues until this input is exhausted.

3. **Determine the Initial State**: Since the problem involves an interactive problem where the number of iterations is determined by user input, the initial state before the loop starts should reflect that the loop will continue based on the input provided.

Given these points, the only relevant state to adjust is the input itself, as it determines how many times the loop will execute. The other variables (`_`) are just placeholders and do not affect the loop's execution condition.

**State:**
- The number of iterations is determined by the input, so we need to ensure that the input mechanism is in place and ready to provide the number of iterations.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be:

**State: **The input mechanism is ready to provide the number of iterations, and the loop will execute for each integer value returned by `int(input())`.**
