Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the indices \(i\) and \(j\) such that \(p_i \oplus p_j\) is maximized using at most \(3n\) queries. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Query Strategy**: The program only compares pairs of the form \((\text{maxi}, i)\) and \((\text{maxi}, i)\), which does not guarantee finding the maximum XOR. It should compare different pairs to explore the entire permutation space.

2. **Missing Exploration**: The program does not explore all possible pairs effectively. For instance, it only considers comparisons involving the current `maxi` value and does not systematically explore other pairs to ensure the maximum XOR is found.

3. **Potential Case Not Handled**: Consider a permutation like \([0, 1, 2, 3]\). The program might incorrectly identify the maximum XOR as being between 0 and 1 (resulting in 1), but the actual maximum XOR is between 0 and 3 (resulting in 3). The program's strategy does not guarantee finding this maximum XOR value.

Given these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
