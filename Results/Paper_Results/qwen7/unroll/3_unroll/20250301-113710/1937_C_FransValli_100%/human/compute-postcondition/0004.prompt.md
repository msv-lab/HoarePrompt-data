You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: This is an interactive problem with no explicit input variables defined in the function signature. The problem involves finding two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The permutation p is a sequence of unique integers from 0 to n-1, and n is an integer such that 2 \leq n \leq 10^4.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state is the result of finding two indices \( i \) and \( j \) in a secret permutation \( p \) such that \( p_i \oplus p_j \) is maximized using at most 3n queries. After executing the loop, the values of \( maxi \) and \( mini \) are printed as the result, where \( maxi \) is the index of the maximum value in the permutation and \( mini \) is the index of the minimum value in the permutation found through the comparison process described in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters. It aims to find two indices i and j in a secret permutation p such that p_i \oplus p_j is maximized using at most 3n queries. The permutation p is a sequence of unique integers from 0 to n-1, where n is an integer within the range 2 to 10^4. The function returns the indices i and j that achieve the maximum XOR value.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
