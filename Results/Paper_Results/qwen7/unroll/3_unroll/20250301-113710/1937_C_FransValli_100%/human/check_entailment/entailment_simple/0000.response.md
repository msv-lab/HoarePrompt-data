### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step to determine its correctness.

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the size of the permutation `n`.

2. **Finding the Maximum Value:**
   - The program initializes `maxi` to 0.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1` and compares `(p[maxi] | p[i])` with itself. Since both sides are the same, the result will always be `=`. This step doesn't serve any purpose and can be removed.

3. **Finding the Minimum Value:**
   - The program initializes `arr` with `[0]`.
   - It iterates from 1 to `n-1` and compares `(p[maxi] | p[i])` with `(p[maxi] | p[i])`. Again, since both sides are the same, the result will always be `=`. This step also doesn't serve any purpose and can be removed.
   - The program then finds the minimum value in `arr` and prints it along with `maxi`.

4. **Output:**
   - The program prints the indices `maxi` and `mini` as the result.

### Issues Identified:
1. **Useless Comparisons:**
   - The comparisons `(p[maxi] | p[i])` with itself are unnecessary and do not provide any useful information.
   - These comparisons can be removed without affecting the logic.

2. **Incorrect Logic for Finding Maximum XOR:**
   - The program aims to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p[i] ⊕ p[j]` is maximized.
   - The current approach does not correctly identify the indices that maximize the XOR value. Instead, it incorrectly identifies the maximum and minimum values in the permutation.

3. **Query Limit:**
   - The program makes more than 3n queries, which violates the constraint of making at most 3n queries.

### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve the problem, we need to use the comparison queries to deduce the indices that maximize the XOR value. Here’s a corrected version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        # Initialize variables to store the indices that maximize XOR
        max_xor = 0
        i_max = 0
        j_max = 0
        
        # Use binary search to find the indices that maximize XOR
        low, high = 0, n-1
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            print(f"? {low} {mid} {high} {mid}", flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        
        # Now low and high should point to the indices that maximize XOR
        i_max = low
        j_max = high
        
        # Verify the result
        print(f"! {i_max} {j_max}", flush=True)

# Example usage
func()
```

### Conclusion:
The given program is incorrect due to the unnecessary comparisons and the incorrect logic for finding the maximum XOR. Therefore, the answer is:

**Correctness: **False**
