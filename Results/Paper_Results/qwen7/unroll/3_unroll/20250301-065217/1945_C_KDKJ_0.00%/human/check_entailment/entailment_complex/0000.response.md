Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function processes a string `a` of length `n` consisting of '0's and '1's.
   - It calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string and stores these counts in a list `S`.
   - It then iterates through the list `S` to find the optimal position `i` where the road should be placed, ensuring that at least half of the residents on each side are satisfied.
   - The condition checked in the loop ensures that the number of residents on each side who are satisfied is at least the ceiling of half the number of residents on that side.
   - If such a position `i` is found, it updates `ans` to this position. If multiple positions have the same minimum distance to the center, the smallest index is chosen.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function handles multiple test cases.
   - It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
   - The function does not modify the input string `a` but uses it in each call to `func_1()`.

3. **Overall Program Correctness**:
   - The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.
   - It processes each test case independently and finds the optimal position for the road placement.
   - The logic for checking the conditions and updating the result is correct.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the required functionality.

Correctness: **True**
