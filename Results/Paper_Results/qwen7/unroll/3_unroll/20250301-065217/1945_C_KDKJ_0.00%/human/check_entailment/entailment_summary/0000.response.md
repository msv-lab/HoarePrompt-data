Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining the optimal position `i` for a road such that at least half of the residents on each side of the village are satisfied with the road's position. This involves checking the balance of '0's (left side) and '1's (right side) around each potential position `i`.
2. `func_1()` calculates the cumulative counts of '0's and '1's up to each position in the string `a`. It then iterates through these counts to find the position `i` that minimizes the absolute difference from the center while satisfying the satisfaction condition.
3. `func_2()` calls `func_1()` for each test case, ensuring that the logic of `func_1()` is applied correctly across multiple test cases.

Given the problem description and the execution summaries, the implementation in `func_1()` appears to correctly calculate the necessary cumulative counts and check the conditions for each position `i`. The logic seems to handle the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
