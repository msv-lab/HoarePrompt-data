Output State: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and the second line contains n non-negative integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n such that 0 ≤ a_i < n; a is a string containing 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. After all iterations, r is a string constructed by mapping each integer in the input list s to its corresponding character in the string a based on the index found in the list b, with b updated by incrementing the count of each index used in the mapping.
