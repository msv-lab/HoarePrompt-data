Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly simulate the game for all possible cases. Specifically, the program incorrectly updates the scores and positions for both players. Let's consider a counterexample to demonstrate this:

### Counterexample:
- **Input:**
  ```
  1
  3 3 1 2
  3 1 2
  5 2 3
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  - Bodya starts at position 1, and Sasha starts at position 2.
  - In the first turn:
    - Bodya's score: `a[1] = 5`.
    - Bodya moves to position `p[1] = 3`, so his new score is `5 + a[3] = 5 + 3 = 8`.
    - Sasha's score: `a[2] = 2`.
    - Sasha moves to position `p[2] = 1`, so her new score is `2 + a[1] = 2 + 5 = 7`.
  - In the second turn:
    - Bodya's score: `8 + a[3] = 8 + 3 = 11`.
    - Bodya moves to position `p[3] = 2`, so his new score is `11 + a[2] = 11 + 2 = 13`.
    - Sasha's score: `7 + a[1] = 7 + 5 = 12`.
    - Sasha moves to position `p[1] = 3`, so her new score is `12 + a[3] = 12 + 3 = 15`.
  - In the third turn:
    - Bodya's score: `13 + a[2] = 13 + 2 = 15`.
    - Bodya moves to position `p[2] = 1`, so his new score is `15 + a[1] = 15 + 5 = 20`.
    - Sasha's score: `15 + a[3] = 15 + 3 = 18`.
    - Sasha moves to position `p[3] = 2`, so her new score is `18 + a[2] = 18 + 2 = 20`.

- **Actual Output:**
  - The program will output "Draw" because it does not correctly simulate the game. The program incorrectly calculates the maximum possible scores without properly updating the positions and scores for each turn.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the logic for the game, and there are cases where it produces incorrect results. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
