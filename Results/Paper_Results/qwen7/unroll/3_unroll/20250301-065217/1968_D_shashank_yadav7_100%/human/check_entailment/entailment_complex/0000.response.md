Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the necessary parameters (`n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`), the permutation `p`, and the array `a`. This part is handled correctly.

2. **Index Adjustment**: The program adjusts the starting positions `b` and `s` to be zero-indexed by subtracting 1, which is necessary because array indices in Python start at 0.

3. **Initial Scores Calculation**: The initial scores for Bodya and Sasha are calculated correctly using the starting positions and the corresponding values in the array `a`.

4. **Game Loop**: The program simulates the game for `k` turns, updating the positions and scores for both players. The logic for moving to the next position based on the permutation `p` and calculating the maximum possible scores is implemented correctly.

5. **Score Comparison**: After the game loop, the program compares the maximum possible scores for Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ('Bodya', 'Sasha', or 'Draw').

6. **Output**: The program handles multiple test cases and outputs the results for each case as required.

Given the above points, the program appears to follow the problem statement accurately and handles all the necessary steps correctly.

Correctness: **True**
