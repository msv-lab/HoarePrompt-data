Reasoning:
1. The goal is to maximize the profit by choosing an optimal \( k \) such that the total revenue from selling the buns is maximized.
2. The binary search approach is used to find the optimal \( k \). The `func_1` function is designed to check if a given \( k \) results in a feasible profit.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the total profit as \( ans = k \times b + (n - k) \times a \).
4. The function then checks if this profit is less than or equal to \( n \times \max(a, b) \). If it is, it means the current \( k \) is feasible; otherwise, it is not.
5. The binary search correctly narrows down the optimal \( k \) by adjusting the `low` and `high` bounds based on the feasibility check returned by `func_1`.
6. The final `ans` after the loop should be the optimal \( k \) that maximizes the profit.

Given the logic and the steps involved, the program appears to be correctly implementing the solution to the problem. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
