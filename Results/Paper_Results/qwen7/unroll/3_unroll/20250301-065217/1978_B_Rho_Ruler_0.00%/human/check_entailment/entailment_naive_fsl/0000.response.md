Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the profit. The given solution uses binary search to find the value of `k`, but the logic inside the `func_1` function is flawed. Specifically, the condition `ans <= n * max(a, b)` is incorrect because it does not ensure that the profit is maximized.

To illustrate, consider the following test case:

- Input: `n = 4`, `a = 4`, `b = 5`
- Expected Output: `17`
- Program Output: The program incorrectly outputs `1`, which is not the maximum profit.

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        max_profit = 0
        for k in range(n + 1):
            profit = k * b + (n - k) * a
            max_profit = max(max_profit, profit)
        print(max_profit)
```

This corrected version iterates over all possible values of `k` from `0` to `n` and calculates the profit for each value, ensuring that the maximum profit is found.
