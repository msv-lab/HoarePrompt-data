Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Variables in the Loop Head**: The loop head contains the variable `_` (an underscore), which is used as a throwaway variable in the `for` loop. This variable is incremented with each iteration but does not hold any meaningful value within the loop itself.

2. **Determine Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs based on the input received from `int(input())`. This means the loop will execute as long as the input is a positive integer.

3. **Identify Relevant States to Adjust**: Since the loop head only contains the variable `_`, and its value is not significant for the loop's execution condition, the only relevant state to adjust is the one that determines how many times the loop will run.

4. **Adjust the State**: The number of iterations is determined by the input provided by the user. Therefore, we need to ensure that the input provided is a positive integer.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted is the input provided by the user, ensuring it is a positive integer.

**State:**
**`input()` must provide a positive integer**
