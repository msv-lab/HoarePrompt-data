Output State: The output state consists of two integers, `maxi` and `mini`, which are determined by the comparisons made within the loop. Specifically, `maxi` is the index that maximizes the bitwise OR operation with itself and another index, while `mini` is the index that minimizes the bitwise XOR operation among the indices that have the same bitwise OR result as `maxi`.
