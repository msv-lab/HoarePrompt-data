You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: None of the input variables are explicitly defined in the function signature. However, the problem description implies that the function should interact with an external entity to perform queries and receive responses. The interaction involves querying indices a, b, c, and d to compare bitwise OR results and finding indices i and j with maximum bitwise XOR.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        
        maxi = 0
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, maxi, i, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                maxi = i
        
        arr = [0]
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            print('?', maxi, arr[0], maxi, i, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '<':
                arr = [i]
            elif res == '=':
                arr.append(i)
        
        mini = arr[0]
        
        for item in arr[1:]:
            print('?', mini, mini, item, item, flush=True)
            res = input()
            if res == '>':
                mini = item
        
        print('!', maxi, mini, flush=True)
        
    #State: Output State: The output state will consist of two integers, `maxi` and `mini`, which are determined by the comparisons made within the loop. Specifically, `maxi` is the index with the maximum result from bitwise XOR comparisons, and `mini` is the index among those with the minimum result from bitwise OR comparisons relative to `maxi`. The exact values of `maxi` and `mini` depend on the input provided during the execution of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function interacts with an external entity to perform queries on indices a, b, c, and d. It compares the bitwise OR results of these indices and finds two indices i and j with the maximum bitwise XOR. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the indices i and j with the maximum bitwise XOR.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
