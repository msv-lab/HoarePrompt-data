Output State: The output state will consist of two integers, `maxi` and `mini`, which are determined by the comparisons made within the loop. Specifically, `maxi` is the index with the maximum result from bitwise XOR comparisons, and `mini` is the index among those with the minimum result from bitwise OR comparisons relative to `maxi`. The exact values of `maxi` and `mini` depend on the input provided during the execution of the loop.
