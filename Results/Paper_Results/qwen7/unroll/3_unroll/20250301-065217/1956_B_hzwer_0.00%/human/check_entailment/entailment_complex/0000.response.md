### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem involves two players, you and Nene, playing a game where they take turns placing cards on a table. Nene always plays optimally to maximize her score while minimizing your score. The goal is to determine the maximum number of points you can get.

2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads `n` and the list of integers `cards` representing the cards in your hand.
   - The function `func_1()` uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It initializes a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points you can get if you start with the `i-th` card and have `j` points already.

3. **DP Table Initialization**:
   - The base cases `dp[n-1][0]` and `dp[n-2][0]` are set to 0 because if you have only one or two cards left, you can't gain any more points.

4. **DP Table Filling**:
   - The outer loop iterates from `n-3` to `0` (inclusive).
   - The inner loop iterates from `n-1` to `0` (inclusive).
   - For each cell `dp[i][j]`, it checks the count of the current card (`j+1`) in the list `cards`.
     - If the card is not present, the value remains the same as the next cell `dp[i+1][j]`.
     - If the card is present once, it considers two scenarios: either you use the card now or skip it.
     - If the card is present twice, it considers three scenarios: using the card now, skipping the card, or using the card after the next one.

5. **Final Result**:
   - The final result is stored in `dp[0][0]`, which gives the maximum number of points you can get starting from the first card.

6. **Optimality**:
   - The approach ensures that you consider all possible moves and choose the one that maximizes your score while minimizing Nene's score, aligning with the problem statement.

### Conclusion:
The given code correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to find the maximum number of points you can get by playing optimally. The logic and the implementation match the problem requirements.

### Correctness:
**True**
