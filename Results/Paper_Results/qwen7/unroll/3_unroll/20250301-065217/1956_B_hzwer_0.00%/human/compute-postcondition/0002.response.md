Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; `n` is an input integer; the list `a` is updated to contain integers read from input, and `cards` is a list of these integers; `dp` is a 2D list with dimensions (n+1) x (n+1), where each element is initialized to 0.**

Explanation: The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(n+1) x (n+1)` where each element is set to 0. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `cards` remain unchanged from their initial state.
