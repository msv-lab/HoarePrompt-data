Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires determining the number of possible values of \( k \) based on the position \( n \) and the number \( x \) received by Vasya during the "first-k-th" settling process.

2. **Key Points**:
   - The settling process repeats every \( 2k-2 \) positions.
   - The formula to find \( k \) involves checking the range within which \( n \) falls and the value of \( x \).
   - The provided code attempts to solve this by calculating the number of valid \( k \) values using a helper function `func_1`.

3. **Code Analysis**:
   - The main loop correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case.
   - The calculation of `y = n + x` and the check for evenness is correct.
   - The call to `func_1` with `(y - 2) // 2` and `(n - x) // 2` seems intended to calculate the range of \( k \) values.
   - However, the function `func_1` does not actually implement the logic required to determine the valid \( k \) values based on the problem statement.

4. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of valid \( k \) values, but it instead returns an empty list in all cases.
   - The logic inside `func_1` checks for divisors of `q` and adds them to the list `M`, but this does not align with the problem requirements.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine the valid \( k \) values, the overall program will not produce the correct results.

Correctness: **False**
