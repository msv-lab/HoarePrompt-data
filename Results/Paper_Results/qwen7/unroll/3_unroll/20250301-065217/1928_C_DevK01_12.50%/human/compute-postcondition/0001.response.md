Output State: **`q` is an integer representing the number of test cases where 1 ≤ `q` ≤ 100, `M` is an empty list, and `w` is the square root of `q`.**

Explanation: The variable `w` is assigned the value of the square root of `q`. Since `q` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `w` will be the square root of that integer. The values of `q` and `M` remain unchanged from their initial states.
