You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
A contest contains n problems and the difficulty of the i -th problem is
expected to be at most b_i . There are already n problem proposals and the
difficulty of the i -th problem is a_i . Initially, both a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
and b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n are sorted in non-decreasing order.

Some of the problems may be more difficult than expected, so the writers must
propose more problems. When a new problem with difficulty w is proposed, the
most difficult problem will be deleted from the contest, and the problems will
be sorted in a way that the difficulties are non-decreasing.

In other words, in each operation, you choose an integer w , insert it into
the array a , sort array a in non-decreasing order, and remove the last
element from it.

Find the minimum number of new problems to make a_i\le b_i for all i .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 100 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains only one positive integer n (1 \leq
n \leq 100 ), representing the number of problems.

The second line of each test case contains an array a of length n (1\le a_1\le
a_2\le\cdots\le a_n\le 10^9 ).

The third line of each test case contains an array b of length n (1\le b_1\le
b_2\le\cdots\le b_n\le 10^9 ).

Output

For each test case, print an integer as your answer in a new line.

Example

Input

    2
    
    6
    
    1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
    
    800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
    
    6
    
    4 5 6 7 8 9
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6

Output

    2
    3
    
Note

In the first test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,2000,2000,2200] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1800 and a becomes [800,1000,1400,1800,2000,2000] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

In the second test case:

  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=1 and a becomes [1,4,5,6,7,8] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=2 and a becomes [1,2,4,5,6,7] . 
  * Propose a problem with difficulty w=3 and a becomes [1,2,3,4,5,6] . 

It can be proved that it's impossible to reach the goal by proposing fewer new
problems.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. a and b are lists of integers of length n, where a and b are sorted in non-decreasing order. Each element in a and b is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a_i, b_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        cnt = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        for j in range(n):
            if b[j] < a[i]:
                cnt += 1
            else:

    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For each iteration of the outer loop, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and b is a list of integers. After all iterations, cnt is the sum of counts where elements in list b are less than the corresponding elements in list a, across all iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads two lists of integers, `a` and `b`, both of length `n` and sorted in non-decreasing order. It then counts how many times an element in list `b` is less than the corresponding element in list `a`. Finally, it prints the count for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine its correctness.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of problems `n`, and the arrays `a` and `b`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - A counter `cnt` is initialized to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of new problems needed.
   - An index `i` is initialized to 0. This index will be used to traverse the array `a`.

3. **Main Logic:**
   - The program iterates over the elements of array `b` using index `j`.
   - For each element `b[j]`, it checks if `b[j]` is less than `a[i]`.
     - If `b[j] < a[i]`, it means we need to propose a new problem with difficulty `b[j]` to replace the current most difficult problem in `a`. Hence, `cnt` is incremented.
     - Otherwise, `i` is incremented to move to the next element in `a`.

4. **Output:**
   - After processing all elements of `b`, the program prints the value of `cnt`.

### Correctness Check

To check the correctness, let's consider the example provided:

#### Example 1:
- **Input:**
  ```
  2
  6
  1000 1400 2000 2000 2200 2700
  800 1200 1500 1800 2200 3000
  6
  4 5 6 7 8 9
  1 2 3 4 5 6
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  2
  3
  ```

#### Analysis of Example 1:
- **First Test Case:**
  - `a = [1000, 1400, 2000, 2000, 2200, 2700]`
  - `b = [800, 1200, 1500, 1800, 2200, 3000]`
  - The program will find that `b[0] < a[0]`, `b[1] < a[0]`, `b[2] < a[0]`, and `b[3] < a[0]`, but not `b[4] < a[0]`.
  - It needs to propose problems with difficulties `800` and `1800` to make `a` match `b`.
  - Therefore, `cnt` should be `2`.

- **Second Test Case:**
  - `a = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`
  - `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
  - The program will find that `b[0] < a[0]`, `b[1] < a[0]`, `b[2] < a[0]`, `b[3] < a[0]`, `b[4] < a[0]`, and `b[5] < a[0]`.
  - It needs to propose problems with difficulties `1`, `2`, `3` to make `a` match `b`.
  - Therefore, `cnt` should be `3`.

### Conclusion

The program correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of new problems needed to ensure that `a[i] <= b[i]` for all `i`. The provided example outputs match the expected results.
