Output State: The value of `t` remains unchanged, and for each `i` from `0` to `n_cases-1`, the program processes an input `n` and prints either `1`, `2 ** power`, or `2 ** (power - 1)` based on the conditions provided in the loop. Here, `power` is incremented until it is no longer less than the base-2 logarithm of `n`, and then adjusted if necessary before printing the result.
