Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n_cases` is an input integer**.

Explanation: The code reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `n_cases`. The initial value of `t` remains unchanged, and now `n_cases` holds the value of the integer input. The precondition that `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 10^4 is preserved.
