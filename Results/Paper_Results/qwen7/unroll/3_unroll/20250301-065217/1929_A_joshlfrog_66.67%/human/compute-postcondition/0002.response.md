Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the value it was initially. The variable `l` is an integer representing the length of the list `nums` for each iteration of the outer loop. The variable `nums` is a list of integers for each iteration of the outer loop. The variables `x` and `y` are reset to 100000000 at the start of each inner loop and are updated based on the values in `nums`. After all iterations, the difference `x - y` is printed for each input case.
