### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not solve the problem as described. Let's break down the issue and verify the solution step-by-step using the function summary and the problem description.

1. **Problem Description and Expected Solution:**
   - The goal is to maximize the beauty of the array, defined as the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - To maximize this sum, we need to sort the array and then compute the sum of differences between consecutive elements.

2. **Function Summary Analysis:**
   - The function processes multiple test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array itself.
   - It then finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and prints their difference.
   - This approach does not guarantee the maximum beauty because it does not sort the array before calculating the differences.

3. **Example Verification:**
   - Consider the input:
     ```
     3
     4
     3 4 3 3
     ```
   - The expected output should be `1` because we can rearrange the array to `[3, 3, 3, 4]`, and the beauty would be `(3-3) + (3-3) + (4-3) = 1`.
   - However, the provided program would output `0` because it simply finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array without sorting it.

4. **Correct Approach:**
   - To achieve the maximum beauty, we need to sort the array and then calculate the sum of differences between consecutive elements.
   - Sorting ensures that the largest differences are between the smallest and largest values, maximizing the overall sum.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as described in the problem statement.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
