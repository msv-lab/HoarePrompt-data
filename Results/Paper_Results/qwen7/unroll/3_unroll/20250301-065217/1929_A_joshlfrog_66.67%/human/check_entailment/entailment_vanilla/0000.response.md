Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes two variables `x` and `y` to store the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
   - By setting `y` to a very large value (`100000000`), it ensures that any element in the array will be smaller than `y` initially.

3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values.
   - This step is crucial because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

4. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After finding the maximum and minimum values, the program calculates the beauty as `x - y`.
   - However, this calculation does not account for the actual beauty as defined in the problem statement. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `x - y`, which is not the correct beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem. It only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

### Correctness:
**False**

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to rearrange the array to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which is a more complex task involving sorting and specific rearrangements.
