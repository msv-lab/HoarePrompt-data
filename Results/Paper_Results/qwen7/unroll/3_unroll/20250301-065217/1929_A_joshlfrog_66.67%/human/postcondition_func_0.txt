The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads another integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list for each sub-case. After processing all sub-cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value but outputs the differences for each sub-case.
