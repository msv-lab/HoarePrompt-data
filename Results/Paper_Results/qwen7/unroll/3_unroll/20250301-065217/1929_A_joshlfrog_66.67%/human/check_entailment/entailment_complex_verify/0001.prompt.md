You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Sasha decided to give his girlfriend an array a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n . He found
out that his girlfriend evaluates the beauty of the array as the sum of the
values (a_i - a_{i - 1}) for all integers i from 2 to n .

Help Sasha and tell him the maximum beauty of the array a that he can obtain,
if he can rearrange its elements in any way.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the length of the array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\leq a_i \leq 10^9 ) — the elements of the array a .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum beauty of the array
a that can be obtained.

Example

Input

    5
    
    3
    
    2 1 3
    
    3
    
    69 69 69
    
    5
    
    100 54 80 43 90
    
    4
    
    3 4 3 3
    
    2
    
    2 1

Output

    2
    0
    57
    1
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, the elements of the array a can be rearranged to make
a = [1, 2, 3] . Then its beauty will be equal to (a_2 - a_1) + (a_3 - a_2) =
(2 - 1) + (3 - 2) = 2 .

In the second test case, there is no need to rearrange the elements of the
array a . Then its beauty will be equal to 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        x = 0
        y = 100000000
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        print(x - y)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 500. For each test case, n is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for e in range(t):
        l = int(input())
        
        nums = [int(x) for x in input().split()]
        
        x = 0
        
        y = 100000000
        
        for i in range(l):
            if nums[i] > x:
                x = nums[i]
            if nums[i] < y:
                y = nums[i]
        
        print(x - y)
        
    #State: Output State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and it is now set to the value it was initially. The variable `l` is an integer, which changes with each iteration but is reset to the value of `l` for each new input. The variable `nums` is a list of integers, which changes with each iteration but is reset to the new list of integers for each new input. The variables `x` and `y` are integers that are updated during the inner loop for each input list but are reset to their initial values (0 for `x` and 100000000 for `y`) for each new input. After all iterations, the final value of `x - y` is printed, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the last input list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a positive integer \( t \) indicating the number of sub-cases. For each sub-case, it reads another integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers. It then calculates and prints the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list for each sub-case. After processing all sub-cases, the function concludes with no explicit return value but outputs the differences for each sub-case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given program step by step to determine if it correctly solves the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the length of the array `l` and the array itself.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - It initializes two variables `x` and `y` to store the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively.
   - By setting `y` to a very large value (`100000000`), it ensures that any element in the array will be smaller than `y` initially.

3. **Finding Maximum and Minimum Values:**
   - It iterates through the array to find the maximum (`x`) and minimum (`y`) values.
   - This step is crucial because the beauty of the array is defined as the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all `i` from 2 to `n`.

4. **Calculating Beauty:**
   - After finding the maximum and minimum values, the program calculates the beauty as `x - y`.
   - However, this calculation does not account for the actual beauty as defined in the problem statement. The beauty should be calculated as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

5. **Output:**
   - The program prints the result of `x - y`, which is not the correct beauty of the array.

### Conclusion:
The given program does not correctly calculate the maximum beauty of the array as defined in the problem. It only finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not the same as the sum of differences between consecutive elements after rearranging the array.

### Correctness:
**False**

To solve the problem correctly, the program needs to rearrange the array to maximize the sum of differences between consecutive elements, which is a more complex task involving sorting and specific rearrangements.
