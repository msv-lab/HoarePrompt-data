Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including \( n \), \( k \), \( P_B \), \( P_S \), the permutation \( p \), and the array \( a \).
2. It initializes the paths for Bodya and Sasha using the given starting positions and the permutation.
3. The program calculates the maximum possible scores for both players by considering all possible moves up to \( k \) turns.
4. It uses a loop to compute the cumulative scores for each path, ensuring that the scores are updated only when the current turn index is less than or equal to \( k \).
5. Finally, it compares the total scores of Bodya and Sasha and prints the appropriate result ("Bodya", "Sasha", or "Draw").

Given the above points, the program logic appears to be consistent with the problem statement and the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
