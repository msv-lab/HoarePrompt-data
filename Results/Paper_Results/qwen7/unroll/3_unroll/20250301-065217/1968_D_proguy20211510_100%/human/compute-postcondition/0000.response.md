Output State: **t is a positive integer, n, k, P_B, P_S are positive integers, p is a permutation of length n, a is an array of positive integers of length n, YES is 'YES', NO is 'NO'**.

Explanation: The code defines two string constants `YES` and `NO`. These assignments do not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `P_B`, `P_S`, `p`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial states. The only changes are the definitions of `YES` and `NO` as specified.
