Reasoning:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Here's why:

1. **Incorrect Substring Selection**: The program attempts to find the substring `z` between the first and last occurrences of '1' when reading from both directions. However, this approach does not guarantee that the selected substring will contain all chips and no free cells between them. The goal is to move all chips into a contiguous block, which may not be achieved by simply selecting the substring between the first and last '1'.

2. **Counting Zeros**: The program counts the number of zeros in the selected substring `z`. This count does not necessarily represent the minimum number of operations required to move all chips into a single block. For instance, consider the input "0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0". The substring `z` would be "110101", and the count of zeros is 3, but the correct answer should be 4 because we need to move the chips to form a single block.

3. **No Consideration of Chip Movements**: The program does not simulate the process of moving chips to the closest free cell to the left, which is necessary to determine the minimum number of operations.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
