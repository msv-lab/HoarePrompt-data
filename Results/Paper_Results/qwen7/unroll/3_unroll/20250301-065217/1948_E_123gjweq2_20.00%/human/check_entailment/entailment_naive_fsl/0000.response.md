Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to ensure that the graph can be partitioned into the minimum possible number of cliques. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly handle the assignment of integers to vertices and the creation of cliques based on the given conditions.

To illustrate this, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  2 3
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  2 1
  1
  1 1
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
2 1
1
1 1
```

This suggests that the program is not correctly assigning the integers to vertices or creating the necessary cliques. For instance, with `n=2` and `k=3`, the only valid assignment would be `a_1 = 1` and `a_2 = 2` (or vice versa), resulting in a single clique since the condition `|i - j| + |a_i - a_j| <= k` is always satisfied. However, the program incorrectly prints `1 1` for the partition, indicating that both vertices are in the same clique, which is correct but does not demonstrate the full capability of the program to handle more complex cases.

To further validate the correctness, consider another test case:

- Input:
  ```
  5 4
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  3 1 5 2 4
  2
  1 1 2 1 2
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
3 1 5 2 4
2
1 1 2 1 2
```

This output is correct, but it does not cover all potential edge cases. For example, consider the case where `n=8` and `k=16`:

- Input:
  ```
  8 16
  ```

- Expected output:
  ```
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
  1
  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
  ```

However, the provided program outputs:
```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
1
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
```

This output is correct, but it does not demonstrate the program's ability to handle cases where `k` is large relative to `n`, and the vertices can be partitioned into fewer cliques. The program does not show any logic to minimize the number of cliques, which is a critical requirement.

Given these observations, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
