Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, `not_mid` is `right - left + 1 - mid`.**

Explanation: The variable `not_mid` is assigned the value `right - left + 1 - mid`. Given that `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`, and knowing `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, we can substitute these into the equation for `mid`:

\[ \text{mid} = ((right + 1) - (left + 1)) // 2 = (right - left) // 2 \]

Therefore, the value of `not_mid` is:

\[ \text{not_mid} = right - left + 1 - ((right - left) // 2) \]

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
