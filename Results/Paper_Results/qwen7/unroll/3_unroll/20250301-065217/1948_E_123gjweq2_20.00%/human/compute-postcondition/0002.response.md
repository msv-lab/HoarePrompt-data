Output State: **`left` is an integer such that `left` < `right`, `right` is an integer, `clique` is an integer representing the clique identifier, `small_element` is `left + 1`, `big_element` is `right + 1`, `mid` is `(big_element - small_element) // 2`.**

Explanation: The code calculates the midpoint between `small_element` and `big_element`. Since `small_element` is `left + 1` and `big_element` is `right + 1`, the expression for `mid` simplifies to `(right + 1 - (left + 1)) // 2`, which further simplifies to `(right - left) // 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
