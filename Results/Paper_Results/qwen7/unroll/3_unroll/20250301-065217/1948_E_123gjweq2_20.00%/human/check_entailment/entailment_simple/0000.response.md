Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function calculates the number of cliques (`cliques`) as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - It initializes an array `arr` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - It also initializes an array `cliquess` of size `n` with all elements set to 0.
   - For each clique `i` from 0 to `cliques - 1`, it calls the function `make_array` to fill a segment of `arr` with the value `i + 1` and update the corresponding elements in `cliquess` with `i + 1`.

2. **Function `make_array`**:
   - It takes `left`, `right`, and `clique` as arguments.
   - It calculates `small_element` as `left + 1` and `big_element` as `right + 1`.
   - It splits the segment `[left, right]` into two parts: the first part with `mid` elements and the second part with `not_mid` elements.
   - It fills the first part of the segment with values from `small_element` to `small_element + mid - 1` and assigns the `clique` to these elements.
   - It fills the second part of the segment with values from `big_element - 1` down to `big_element - not_mid` and assigns the `clique` to these elements.

3. **Output**:
   - The output of `func_1` is the array `arr`, the number of cliques `cliques`, and the array `cliquess`.
   - The array `arr` is filled in such a way that it satisfies the condition for forming cliques based on the given `k`.
   - The number of cliques `cliques` is calculated correctly as `ceil(n / k)`.
   - The array `cliquess` is filled to indicate which clique each vertex belongs to.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the functions, the program appears to correctly generate a valid assignment of values to vertices and the corresponding partition into cliques.

Correctness: **True**
