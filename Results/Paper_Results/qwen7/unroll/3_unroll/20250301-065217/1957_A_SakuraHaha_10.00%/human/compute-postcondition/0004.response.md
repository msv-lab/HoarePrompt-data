Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in the given code is `for x in a:`. This means the variables involved in the loop head are `x` and `a`.

2. **Understand the loop behavior**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `a`, assigning each element to the variable `x` in each iteration.

3. **Determine initial conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The list `a` must contain at least one element for the loop to execute at least once.
   - The variable `x` will take the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.

4. **Adjust the states**:
   - Since `a` is a list of integers obtained from splitting an input string, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element.
   - The variable `x` will be set to each element in `a` during the loop, but since we are only concerned with the initial state before the loop starts, we don't need to specify its exact value yet.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `a` must have at least one element.
- `t` and `n` are not directly related to the loop execution and can remain as they are.
- `ans` and `cnt` are not directly related to the loop execution and can remain as they are.

Therefore, the state after adjusting for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`a` must have at least one element**
