To determine what will be printed, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `ans` is an integer.
   - `ans` is calculated by summing up the values in the dictionary `cnt` and then performing integer division by 4 for each value.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   print(ans)
   ```

Given the initial state, we need to understand how `ans` is computed. Let's assume the dictionary `cnt` has some values. For example, if `cnt = {1: 8, 2: 12, 3: 16}`, then:

- The values in `cnt` are 8, 12, and 16.
- Each value is divided by 4: \( \frac{8}{4} = 2 \), \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \), \( \frac{16}{4} = 4 \).
- The sum of these results is \( 2 + 3 + 4 = 9 \).

So, `ans` would be 9 in this case.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `ans`.

Output: **9**
