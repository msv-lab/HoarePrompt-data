Precondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 1.**

The provided function `func_1` does not seem to directly relate to the problem description. It appears to be a helper function that generates prime factors of a given number `n`. However, based on the problem description, we need to focus on the precondition related to the input variables `n` and `x` as described in the program's documentation. Therefore, the precondition should be derived from the problem description rather than the function itself.

Given the problem description and the input/output format, the correct precondition should be:

Precondition: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, and for each test case, n and x are integers such that 1 ≤ x < n ≤ 10^9.**
