Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`n`) and iterates through each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.
3. The logic inside the loop checks if it's possible to accommodate all participants based on the given constraints:
   - If the number of extroverts (`b`) is not divisible by 3 and there are fewer than 3 universals (`c`), it prints `-1` because it's impossible to find a suitable tent for the remaining extroverts.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the minimum number of tents required:
     - Each introvert (`a`) needs a separate tent, contributing `a` to the total count.
     - Each group of 3 people (either 2 extroverts and 1 universal or 3 universals) requires 1 tent, contributing `(b + c) // 3` to the total count.
     - If there are leftover people (i.e., `(b + c) % 3 != 0`), an additional tent is needed, contributing `1` to the total count.
4. The program correctly outputs the result for each test case and ensures that the logic adheres to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
