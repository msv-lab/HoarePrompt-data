The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of three non-negative integers a, b, and c. For each test case, it calculates a value k based on specific conditions involving a, b, and c. If the conditions are met, k is updated accordingly; otherwise, -1 is printed. After processing all test cases, the final value of k is the sum of all valid updates across the iterations. The function prints the value of k for each test case and returns no explicit value.
