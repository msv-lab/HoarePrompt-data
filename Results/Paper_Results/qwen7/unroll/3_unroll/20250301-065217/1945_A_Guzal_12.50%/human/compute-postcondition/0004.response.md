Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but processes a list of test cases, where each test case consists of three non-negative integers a, b, and c. The function returns the result based on the conditions specified for these integers.**

Given the constraints and relationships:
- `t` (the number of test cases) is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- Each test case consists of three non-negative integers `a`, `b`, and `c` such that \(0 \leq a, b, c \leq 10^9\), representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals, respectively.

The function processes each test case and returns results based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. However, since the specific logic for processing and returning the results is not provided, the focus here is on the parameters and the nature of the input and output.
