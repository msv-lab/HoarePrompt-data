Let's break down the task step by step:

1. Identify the objects involved in the loop head:
   - The loop variable `i`
   - The loop control variable `n`

2. Determine the initial state of these objects:
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `n` is an input integer

3. Understand the condition for the loop to execute:
   - The loop `for i in range(n)` will execute as long as `n` is a non-negative integer.

4. Adjust the state of the objects involved in the loop head:
   - Since `i` is initialized within the loop (`i` starts from 0), no adjustment is needed for `i`.
   - For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer. Given that `n` is an input integer, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 0.

5. Combine the necessary adjustments into the final state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be a non-negative integer**
