Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an input integer.**

Explanation: The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer input from the user and assigns it to the variable `n`. The variable `t` remains unchanged and still holds the value it had in the initial state, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^4.
