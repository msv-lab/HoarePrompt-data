You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

ඞ

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters. You need to
partition^\dagger this string into some substrings, such that each substring
is not a palindrome^\ddagger .

^\dagger A partition of a string s is an ordered sequence of some k strings
t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k , such that t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k = s , where + here
represents the concatenation operation.

^\ddagger A string s is considered a palindrome if it reads the same backwards
as forwards. For example, \mathtt{racecar} , \mathtt{abccba} , and \mathtt{a}
are palindromes, but \mathtt{ab} , \mathtt{dokibird} , and \mathtt{kurosanji}
are not.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a string s consisting of lowercase Latin characters (1
\le |s| \le 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of |s| over all test cases does not exceed 10^6
.

Output

For each test case, print on one line "YES" if there exists a partition of s
whose parts are not palindromes, or "NO" if there is no such partition.

If the answer is "YES", on the second line, print an integer k — the number of
parts that s needs to be partitioned to such that each part is not a
palindrome. On the third line, print k strings t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k
representing such a partition. If there are multiple such partitions, print
any of them.

Example

Input

    3
    
    sinktheyacht
    
    lllllllll
    
    uwuowouwu

Output

    YES
    1
    sinktheyacht
    NO
    YES
    3
    uw uow ouwu
    
Note

In the first test case, since \mathtt{sinktheyacht} is already non-palindrome,
the partition [\mathtt{sinktheyacht}] is valid.

In the second test case, as any substring of the string s is palindrome, there
are no valid partitions.

In the third test case, another valid partition is [\mathtt{uw},\mathtt{uo},
\mathtt{wou}, \mathtt{wu}] .

    #State: Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 10^6. The loop processes each string `s` according to its conditions, and based on the given logic, it determines whether the string meets certain criteria and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. After all iterations, the variable `t` will be decremented to 0, and the variable `done` will be set to `True` for each iteration where the condition is met. The strings `s` will be processed according to the rules defined within the loop, and the output will reflect whether each string satisfies the specified conditions or not.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases) and a string `s` (lowercase Latin characters). For each test case, it checks specific conditions on the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if the conditions are met. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, and `done` is set to `True` for each test case where the conditions are satisfied.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Let's analyze the given Python function to determine if it correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Reading Input and Initial Checks:**
   - The function reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - It iterates through each test case.
   - For each string, it checks if the length is 1. If so, it prints "NO" because a single character is always a palindrome.
   - It then checks if the first character `x` is different from the last character. If they are different, it prints "YES" with a partition of the entire string, which is correct because the whole string is not a palindrome.
   - It also checks if all characters in the string are the same. If so, it prints "NO" because any partition would include at least one palindrome.
   - It further checks if all but one character are the same. If so, it prints "NO" unless the string has an odd length and the middle character is different, in which case it prints "YES" with a partition of the entire string.

2. **Main Logic:**
   - The main logic starts by initializing `count` and `count2` to zero.
   - It iterates through the first half of the string to find the first position where characters differ.
   - If such a position is found, it prints "YES" with a partition of the string up to that point and the rest.
   - If no such position is found, it checks if `count2` is greater than `count`. If so, it prints "YES" with a partition of the string up to `count` and the rest.
   - If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "NO".

### Issues Identified:
1. **Handling Single Character Strings:**
   - The function correctly handles single-character strings by printing "NO".
   
2. **Handling Strings with All Characters the Same:**
   - The function correctly handles strings where all characters are the same by printing "NO".
   
3. **Handling Strings with All But One Character the Same:**
   - The function correctly handles strings where all but one character are the same by printing "NO" unless the string has an odd length and the middle character is different, in which case it prints "YES".
   
4. **Finding Non-Palindromic Partitions:**
   - The function attempts to find a non-palindromic partition by checking for differing characters in the first half of the string. However, it does not handle all cases correctly.
   - For example, consider the string "aab". The function will incorrectly print "NO" because it does not find a differing character in the first half.
   - Consider the string "abca". The function will correctly print "YES" with a partition of "a" and "bca", but it does not check if "bca" can be further partitioned.
   - Consider the string "abcde". The function will correctly print "YES" with a partition of "abc" and "de", but it does not check if "abc" can be further partitioned.

5. **Partitioning Further:**
   - The function does not ensure that the partitions themselves are not palindromic. For example, it should check if "abc" can be further partitioned into "a" and "bc" or "ab" and "c".

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly handle all edge cases and does not ensure that the partitions themselves are not palindromic. Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

### Final Answer:
Correctness: **False**
