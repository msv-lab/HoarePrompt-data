Output State: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 10^4, and `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters such that 1 ≤ |`s`| ≤ 10^6. The loop processes each string `s` according to its conditions, and based on the given logic, it determines whether the string meets certain criteria and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if applicable. After all iterations, the variable `t` will be decremented to 0, and the variable `done` will be set to `True` for each iteration where the condition is met. The strings `s` will be processed according to the rules defined within the loop, and the output will reflect whether each string satisfies the specified conditions or not.
