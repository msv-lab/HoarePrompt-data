The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer `t` (number of test cases) and a string `s` (lowercase Latin characters). For each test case, it checks specific conditions on the string `s` and prints either 'YES' or 'NO' along with additional information if the conditions are met. The function does not return any value but outputs the results for each test case. After processing all test cases, the variable `t` is decremented to 0, and `done` is set to `True` for each test case where the conditions are satisfied.
