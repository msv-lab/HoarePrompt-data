Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, it fails to correctly partition the string into non-palindromic substrings when the string length is odd and contains more than one unique character in the middle. 

Consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3
aba
abc
abba
```

Expected Output:
```
NO
YES
2
ab ba
YES
2
ab ba
```

However, the program will output:
```
NO
YES
2
aba c
NO
```

The issue arises because the program checks for the first non-palindromic pair and then stops, which may not always result in the optimal partition. For example, in the string "aba", the program incorrectly outputs "NO" instead of recognizing that it cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. Similarly, for "abba", the program outputs "NO" instead of "YES" with the partition "ab ba".
