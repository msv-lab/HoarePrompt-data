Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires setting up stalls and pricing them such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels using her `n` coins.
2. **Key Points from the Execution Summary**:
   - The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it processes `n` and `k` to determine if Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels.
   - It uses a loop to simulate Alice buying jewels from stalls, adjusting `n` and `k` accordingly.
   - If `k` reaches zero, it prints 'YES' and the details of the stalls setup.
   - If `k` does not reach zero after 60 iterations, it prints 'NO'.

3. **Analysis of the Code**:
   - The code correctly initializes variables and reads input.
   - The loop structure ensures that the process stops after 60 iterations or when `n` is exhausted.
   - The logic inside the loop seems to handle the division of `n` by `k` and adjusts the values appropriately.
   - The conditions for printing 'YES' and 'NO' are correctly implemented.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code handles the case where `n` is less than `k` by adjusting the division logic.
   - It ensures that the number of stalls does not exceed 60.

Given the above points, the provided code appears to correctly implement the solution according to the problem statement and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
