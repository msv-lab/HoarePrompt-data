Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop head variables**: The loop head in this case is `for _ in range(t):`. The variables involved here are `_` (a dummy variable) and `t`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.
   - It is given that `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.

3. **Understand the condition for the loop to execute**: The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer input between 1 and 1000, it will always be greater than 0.

4. **Adjust the state accordingly**: Since the loop will always execute given the constraints on `t`, we need to ensure that `t` is within its valid range. Therefore, we need to set `t` to a value that satisfies `1 ≤ t ≤ 1000`.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000**
