Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem requires determining if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls with specific prices such that Alice, who buys greedily, ends up buying exactly \( k \) jewels. The solution logic should ensure that Alice's purchases match \( k \) exactly within the constraints.

2. **Analyze the Given Code**:
   - The code correctly reads the number of test cases \( t \).
   - For each test case, it reads the number of coins \( n \) and the number of jewels \( k \) Alice wants to buy.
   - It then enters a loop where it tries to find a sequence of prices such that Alice buys exactly \( k \) jewels.
   - The loop logic:
     - Determines the minimum and maximum number of jewels Alice can buy from the current stall.
     - Updates the number of jewels \( k \) and the remaining coins \( n \) accordingly.
     - Appends the chosen number of jewels to the list `tab`.
     - Increments the count of stalls `rep`.
   - After the loop, it checks if \( k \) is zero. If so, it prints "YES" along with the number of stalls and the sequence of prices. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

3. **Check for Correctness**:
   - The logic for determining the number of jewels Alice can buy from each stall seems correct. It ensures that Alice buys the maximum possible number of jewels without exceeding her budget.
   - The loop runs for at most 60 iterations, which matches the problem constraint.
   - The final check to see if \( k \) is zero after the loop is correct, ensuring that Alice has bought exactly \( k \) jewels.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
