Output State: The output state will consist of `t` lines, where each line contains the result of the expression `m // a + m // b + 2` for the corresponding input values of `a`, `b`, and `m` provided in the loop. Each input set `(a, b, m)` will produce one line of output, and the total number of lines will be equal to the value of `t`.
