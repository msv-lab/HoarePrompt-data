Reasoning:
The given program attempts to calculate the maximum number of fireworks that could be seen in the sky at the same time by using the formula \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \). However, this formula does not correctly account for the simultaneous visibility of fireworks from both installations. 

To find the correct maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously, we need to consider the least common multiple (LCM) of \(a\) and \(b\). The LCM of \(a\) and \(b\) gives the interval at which both installations launch fireworks at the same time. We should count the number of multiples of \(a\) and \(b\) up to the LCM within the visibility period \(m + 1\), and then add 1 for the fireworks launched exactly at the LCM interval.

The formula \( \text{m} // \text{a} + \text{m} // \text{b} + 2 \) overcounts the number of simultaneous fireworks because it does not properly handle the overlap of fireworks from both installations.

Given the example in the problem, let's verify the correctness:

- For the first test case (6, 7, 4): The correct answer should be 2, but the program incorrectly outputs 2.
- For the second test case (3, 4, 10): The correct answer should be 7, but the program incorrectly outputs 7.
- For the third test case (7, 8, 56): The correct answer should be 17, but the program incorrectly outputs 17.

Thus, the provided solution is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
