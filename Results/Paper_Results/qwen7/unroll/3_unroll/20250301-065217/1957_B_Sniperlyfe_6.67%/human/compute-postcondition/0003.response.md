Output State: `t` test cases, `n` and `k` as specified, `nums` is a list of length `n` where each element is `2^k.bit_length() - 1`. After the loop executes, `k` is reduced by the value of `2^k.bit_length() - 1` for each iteration, but since `nums[i]` is assigned the same value in each iteration, `k` will eventually become less than `2^k.bit_length() - 1`, and the loop will stop when `k` is no longer positive. The final state of `nums` will be a list of `n` elements, each being the maximum possible value for the bit length of `k` before it became too small.
