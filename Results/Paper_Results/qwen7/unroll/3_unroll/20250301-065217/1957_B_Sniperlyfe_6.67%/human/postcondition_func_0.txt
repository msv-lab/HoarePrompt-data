The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. It initializes a list `nums` of length `n` where each element is set to the maximum possible value for the bit length of `k` (i.e., `2^k - 1`). In the last iteration, if `k` is still positive, it adds the remaining value of `k` to the last element of `nums`. The function then returns this list `nums`.
