Reasoning:
1. The problem involves determining the winner of a game based on the initial configuration of stone piles.
2. The given solution uses a function `func_1` to determine the winner.
3. The function first removes duplicates and sorts the array.
4. If the smallest element is not 1, it immediately returns 'Alice'.
5. Otherwise, it checks for gaps greater than 1 in the sorted array. If such gaps exist, it alternates the boolean value `A`.
6. Finally, it returns 'Alice' if `A` is true, otherwise 'Bob'.

Let's analyze the logic:

- If the smallest element is not 1, Alice can always win by removing 1 stone from each pile, making the smallest pile 0 and ensuring Bob cannot make a valid move.
- For the remaining part, the key observation is that the game state can be simplified to a Nim game with a single pile of size equal to the minimum non-zero pile. The game is won by the player who leaves the opponent with a pile size that is a multiple of the smallest non-zero pile minus 1. This is because removing the same amount from each pile maintains the invariant of the smallest pile being the same.

The provided code correctly handles the special case where the smallest element is not 1. However, the logic for checking gaps and alternating `A` is flawed. The correct approach should be to consider the XOR of the sizes of the piles after removing the smallest element.

Here is the corrected explanation:
- If the smallest element is 1, the game reduces to a Nim game where the winning strategy is based on the XOR of the remaining pile sizes.
- If the XOR of the remaining pile sizes is non-zero, the first player (Alice) wins; otherwise, the second player (Bob) wins.

Since the provided code does not implement this correct logic, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
