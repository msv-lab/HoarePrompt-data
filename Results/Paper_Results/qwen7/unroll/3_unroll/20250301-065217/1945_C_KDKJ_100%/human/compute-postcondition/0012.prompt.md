You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 3*10^5, and a is a string of length n consisting only of '0' and '1'.
def func_1():
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    S = [[0, 0]]
    for s in a:
        x, y = S[-1]
        
        if s == '0':
            x += 1
        else:
            y += 1
        
        S.append([x, y])
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `n` is the length of this string; `S` is a list containing one sublist where the first element is the count of '0's in `a` and the second element is the count of '1's in `a`.
    ans = -1
    for i in range(n + 1):
        left = S[i][0]
        
        lsum = i
        
        right = S[-1][1] - S[i][1]
        
        rsum = n - i
        
        if left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum:
            continue
        elif abs(n / 2 - i) < abs(n / 2 - ans):
            ans = i
        
    #State: Output State: `a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1', and `n` is the length of this string; `S` is a list containing one sublist where the first element is the count of '0's in `a` and the second element is the count of '1's in `a`; `ans` is the index `i` that minimizes the absolute difference between `i` and `n/2` while satisfying the condition `left * 2 < lsum` or `right * 2 < rsum`.
    print(ans)
    #This is printed: ans (where ans is the index that minimizes the absolute difference between i and n/2 while satisfying the condition left * 2 < lsum or right * 2 < rsum)
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts no parameters and returns a string `a` of length n (where 3 <= n <= 3*10^5) consisting only of '0' and '1'.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
