Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variables `i` and `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of these variables**:
   - `i` is the loop counter, and it starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `n`.
   - `n` is the length of the input string `a`.

3. **Check the conditions for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.
   - Initially, `i` is 0, and `n` is the length of the string `a`.

4. **Adjust the states accordingly**:
   - Since `i` starts at 0 and the loop will run as long as `i <= n`, we need to ensure that `i` is 0 and `n` is the correct length of the string `a`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is an input string consisting only of '0' and '1'.
- `n` is the length of this string.
- `S` is a list containing one sublist where the first element is the count of '0's in `a` and the second element is the count of '1's in `a`.
- `ans` is -1.

We only need to adjust the states of `i` and `n` for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is the length of string `a`**
