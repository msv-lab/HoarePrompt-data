### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases `kreker` and iterates over each test case using a for loop. This part is correct.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1()` is defined to handle each test case. It reads two integers `n` and `m` using `input().split()` and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This part is also correct.

3. **Logic Check**:
   - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0 and n - m >= 0` checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative. However, this condition alone does not fully capture the problem requirements.
     - The problem states that in one move, Nikita can either add 1 cube or remove 1 cube. Therefore, the total number of cubes added and removed must result in `m` cubes.
     - The condition `(n - m) % 2 == 0` ensures that the difference between `n` and `m` is even, which is necessary but not sufficient. We need to ensure that the absolute value of the difference is within the bounds of `n` (i.e., `|n - m| <= n`).

4. **Output**:
   - The program prints "Yes" if the condition is met, and "No" otherwise. However, the condition `n - m >= 0` is not always necessary. The correct condition should be `|n - m| <= n`.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment is partially correct but incomplete. The condition `n - m >= 0` is unnecessary and can lead to incorrect results. The correct condition should be `|n - m| <= n`.

### Corrected Condition:
The correct condition should be:
```python
if abs(n - m) <= n and (n - m) % 2 == 0:
```

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The original assessment was inaccurate because it did not include the necessary condition `|n - m| <= n`, which is crucial for determining whether it is possible to achieve exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
