Reasoning:

Let's analyze the problem and the provided program step-by-step using the function summary and the original assessment.

### Problem Description Analysis
- The problem requires determining if it is possible for Nikita to have exactly `m` cubes after `n` moves.
- Each move can either add or remove exactly one cube.
- Therefore, `n` (total moves) must be at least `m` (final number of cubes).

### Function Summary Analysis
- The function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- This means it checks if the difference between `n` and `m` is even and non-negative.

### Original Assessment Analysis
- The original assessment correctly points out that the current implementation does not check if `n >= m`.
- Without this check, the program would incorrectly output "Yes" for cases like `n = 2` and `m = 4` because `(2 - 4) % 2 == 0` and `2 - 4 >= 0` are both false, but the program does not ensure `n >= m`.

### Corrected Implementation
- The proposed correction in the original assessment adds a check `if n < m:` at the beginning of `func_1()`.
- This ensures that if `n` is less than `m`, the program immediately outputs "No".
- After this check, the program proceeds to check if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.

### Verification Using the Function Summary
- The function summary states that the function checks if `(n - m) % 2 == 0` and `n - m >= 0`.
- With the added check `if n < m:`, the function now ensures that `n >= m` before performing the modulo operation and comparison.

Given the above analysis, the original assessment was accurate in identifying the issue and proposing a solution. The corrected implementation in the original assessment ensures that the program behaves correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
