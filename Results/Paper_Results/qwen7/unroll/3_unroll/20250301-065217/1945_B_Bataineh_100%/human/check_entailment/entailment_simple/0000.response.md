Reasoning:
1. The annotated program correctly reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` for each case.
3. The logic within the loop checks different conditions to determine the maximum number of fireworks visible simultaneously:
   - If `m < a` and `m < b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible is 2.
   - If `m < a` and `m > b`, the maximum number of fireworks visible is `2 + m // b`.
   - If `m < b` and `m > a`, the maximum number of fireworks visible is `2 + m // a`.
   - Otherwise, the maximum number of fireworks visible is `m // a + m // b + 2`.

4. The logic provided in the conditions seems to cover all possible scenarios for the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` within the given constraints.

5. However, there is a potential issue with the logic. The conditions do not account for the case where `a` and `b` are equal and less than `m`. In such a scenario, the current logic might not yield the correct result because it does not handle the overlap of fireworks from both installations properly.

Given the example provided, the logic seems to work for the given test cases. But the provided logic might fail in certain edge cases, especially when `a` and `b` are equal and less than `m`.

Correctness: **False**

To fix the logic, we need to ensure that the conditions cover all possible scenarios, including when `a` and `b` are equal and less than `m`. Here's a revised version of the logic:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a, b, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        # Ensure a <= b without loss of generality
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a
        
        if m < a:
            print(2)
        else:
            # Calculate the number of fireworks from each installation
            fireworks_a = m // a
            fireworks_b = m // b
            
            # Handle the case where a and b are equal
            if a == b:
                print(fireworks_a + 1)
            else:
                print(fireworks_a + fireworks_b + 1)
```

This revised logic ensures that the conditions are handled correctly and covers all possible scenarios.
