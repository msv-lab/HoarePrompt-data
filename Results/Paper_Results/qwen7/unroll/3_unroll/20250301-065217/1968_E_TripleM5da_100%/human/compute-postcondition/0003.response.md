Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but operates within a loop for t test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer n and returns either "valid" if 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3, or "invalid" if n is out of this range.**

This means the function runs t times (where t is between 1 and 50), each time accepting an integer n (where n is between 2 and 1000). It then checks if n falls within the specified range. If it does, the function returns "valid"; otherwise, it returns "invalid".
