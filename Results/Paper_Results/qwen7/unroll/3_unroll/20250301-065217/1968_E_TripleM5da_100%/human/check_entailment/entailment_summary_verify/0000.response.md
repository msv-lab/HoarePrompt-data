### Reasoning:

Let's re-evaluate the program based on the given problem description and the function summary.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- We need to maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\) which contains distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an \(n \times n\) grid.
- The program should output \(n\) points that achieve this maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\).

#### Function Summary Recap:
- The function processes multiple test cases.
- For each test case, it reads an integer \(n\) and outputs a specific sequence of pairs.
- It first prints "1 1" and "1 2", followed by pairs of numbers from 3 to \(n\), each number paired with itself.

#### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Initial Output**: The program starts by printing "1 1" and "1 2".
   - These points ensure that the Manhattan distance 1 is included in \(\mathcal{H}\).
   
2. **Subsequent Output**: The program then prints pairs \((i, i)\) for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\).
   - This ensures that the Manhattan distance \(0\) is included (since \(|i-i| = 0\)).
   - This also ensures that the Manhattan distance \(1\) is included (since \(|1-1| = 0\) and \(|1-2| = 1\)).
   - For \(i \geq 3\), the Manhattan distances \(|i-1|\) and \(|i-2|\) are included.

#### Checking the Size of \(\mathcal{H}\):
- For \(n = 2\):
  - The output is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    ```
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1\}\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 2

- For \(n = 3\):
  - The output is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    3 3
    ```
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2\}\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 3

- For \(n = 4\):
  - The output is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    3 3
    4 4
    ```
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 4

- For \(n = 5\):
  - The output is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    3 3
    4 4
    5 5
    ```
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 5

- For \(n = 6\):
  - The output is:
    ```
    1 1
    1 2
    3 3
    4 4
    5 5
    6 6
    ```
  - Distances: \(\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
  - \(\mathcal{H} = \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\)
  - Size of \(\mathcal{H}\): 6

From the above analysis, we can see that the program consistently outputs a set \(\mathcal{H}\) whose size is equal to \(n\). This means the program correctly maximizes the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n \geq 2\).

#### Conclusion:
The original assessment was incorrect because the program does indeed maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \(n \geq 2\).

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
