Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem for all values of \( n \). Specifically, the program only prints the points \((1, 1)\), \((1, 2)\), and for \(i\) from 3 to \(n\), it prints \((i, i)\). This approach does not always maximize the size of the set \(\mathcal{H}\).

For example, for \( n = 3 \), the program would output:
```
1 1
1 2
3 3
```

However, the optimal solution for \( n = 3 \) should include points such as \((2, 1)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 1)\) to achieve the maximum size of \(\mathcal{H}\), which is \(\{0, 1, 2, 3\}\).

Therefore, the program does not correctly maximize the size of \(\mathcal{H}\) for all \( n \), and hence the correctness is False.
