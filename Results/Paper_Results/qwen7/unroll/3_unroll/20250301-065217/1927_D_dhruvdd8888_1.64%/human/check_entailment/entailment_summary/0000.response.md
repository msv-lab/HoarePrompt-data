Reasoning:
1. The program correctly identifies segments of consecutive identical numbers in the input list and stores their start and end indices along with the number itself.
2. For each query, the program uses binary search (`bisect_left`) to find the relevant segment within the stored segments that overlaps with the query range.
3. The logic for determining the indices `i` and `j` to print is correct:
   - If the start of the segment is greater than `l`, it checks if the segment starts at position 1. If so, it prints `(-1, -1)` since there's no element before the segment. Otherwise, it prints the indices of the last element of the previous segment and the first element of the current segment.
   - If the end of the segment is less than `r`, it prints `(-1, -1)` since the segment does not fully overlap with the query range.
   - If the end of the segment is within the bounds of the array, it prints the start and end indices of the segment.
4. The program handles edge cases and prints the results directly without returning any value, which aligns with the problem statement.

Given the above analysis, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
