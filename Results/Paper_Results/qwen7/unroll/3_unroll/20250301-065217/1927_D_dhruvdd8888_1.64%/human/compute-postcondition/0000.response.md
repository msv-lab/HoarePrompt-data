Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, the array a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^6], and q is an integer such that 1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5. Each query is represented by two integers l and r such that 1 <= l < r <= n. The function `input` is now set to `sys.stdin.readline`.**

The code `input = sys.stdin.readline` simply reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.readline`, which changes how input is read from the standard input. However, it does not affect the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `q`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial states.
