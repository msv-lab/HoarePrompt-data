The function accepts a string `encoded` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and returns a decoded string. It creates a mapping of each letter from 'a' to 'z' to a unique character from the `encoded` string. If a character is repeated in `encoded`, it uses the previously mapped character. If a new character is encountered, it assigns it a unique character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet. The function then constructs and returns the decoded string by replacing each character in `encoded` with its corresponding mapped character.
