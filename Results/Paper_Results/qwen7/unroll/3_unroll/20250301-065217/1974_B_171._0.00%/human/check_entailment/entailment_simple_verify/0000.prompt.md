You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Polycarp has a string s , which consists of lowercase Latin letters. He
encodes this string using the following algorithm:

  * first, he constructs a new auxiliary string r , which consists of all distinct letters of the string s , written in alphabetical order; 
  * then the encoding happens as follows: each character in the string s is replaced by its symmetric character from the string r (the first character of the string r will be replaced by the last, the second by the second from the end, and so on). 

For example, encoding the string s ="codeforces" happens as follows:

  * the string r is obtained as "cdefors"; 
  * the first character s_1 ='c' is replaced by 's'; 
  * the second character s_2 ='o' is replaced by 'e'; 
  * the third character s_3 ='d' is replaced by 'r'; 
  * ... 
  * the last character s_{10} ='s' is replaced by 'c'.

The string r and replacements for s ="codeforces".

Thus, the result of encoding the string s ="codeforces" is the string
"serofedsoc".

Write a program that performs decoding — that is, restores the original string
s from the encoding result.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the string b .

The second line of each test case contains a string b of length n , consisting
of lowercase Latin letters — the result of encoding the original string s .

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n over all test cases in the
test does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output the string s from which the encoding result b was
obtained.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly establish the mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r`. Instead of creating an auxiliary string `r` and then finding the symmetric character for each character in the encoded string, the current implementation tries to manually construct the mapping, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, and the decoding process should map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**: The current implementation attempts to create a mapping by iterating through all lowercase letters (`ord('a')` to `ord('z')`) and assigning them to characters in the encoded string. This approach does not ensure that the characters in the auxiliary string `r` are used in the correct order.

2. **Example Test Case**: For the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`, the correct auxiliary string `r` is `"cdefors"`. The decoding process should map:
   - `'s'` to `'c'`
   - `'e'` to `'f'`
   - `'r'` to `'o'`
   - `'o'` to `'r'`
   - `'f'` to `'e'`
   - `'d'` to `'d'`
   - `'s'` to `'c'`
   - `'o'` to `'r''
   - `'c'` to `'s'`

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this mapping. It assigns characters in a linear fashion without considering the correct order of characters in the auxiliary string `r`.

To fix this, the program should first construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string, then create a reverse mapping to decode the string correctly. Here’s a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Create a reverse mapping
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

This corrected version ensures that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed correctly and the reverse mapping is used to decode the string accurately.
