Reasoning:
1. The function `func_1` aims to decode the `encoded` string back to the original string `s`.
2. The function creates a mapping between each unique character in the `encoded` string and a character from 'a' to 'z'.
3. For each character in the `encoded` string, it checks if the character is already mapped. If not, it finds the next available character from 'a' to 'z' that hasn't been used yet and maps it to the current character.
4. After creating the mapping, it constructs the decoded string by replacing each character in the `encoded` string with its corresponding character from the mapping.
5. The logic for creating the mapping ensures that each character in the `encoded` string is correctly mapped to a unique character from 'a' to 'z', and the reverse mapping is correctly applied during decoding.

Given the problem description and the provided logic, the function `func_1` correctly decodes the `encoded` string to the original string `s`.

Correctness: **True**
