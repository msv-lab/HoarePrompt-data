Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly decode the encoded string according to the problem description. Specifically, the `func_1` function does not properly establish the mapping between characters in the encoded string and their corresponding characters in the auxiliary string `r`. Instead of creating an auxiliary string `r` and then finding the symmetric character for each character in the encoded string, the current implementation tries to manually construct the mapping, which leads to incorrect results.

For example, consider the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`. According to the problem description, the auxiliary string `r` should be `"cdefors"`, and the decoding process should map each character in the encoded string to its symmetric counterpart in `r`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the issue:

1. **Incorrect Mapping Construction**: The current implementation attempts to create a mapping by iterating through all lowercase letters (`ord('a')` to `ord('z')`) and assigning them to characters in the encoded string. This approach does not ensure that the characters in the auxiliary string `r` are used in the correct order.

2. **Example Test Case**: For the encoded string `"serofedsoc"`, the correct auxiliary string `r` is `"cdefors"`. The decoding process should map:
   - `'s'` to `'c'`
   - `'e'` to `'f'`
   - `'r'` to `'o'`
   - `'o'` to `'r'`
   - `'f'` to `'e'`
   - `'d'` to `'d'`
   - `'s'` to `'c'`
   - `'o'` to `'r''
   - `'c'` to `'s'`

However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this mapping. It assigns characters in a linear fashion without considering the correct order of characters in the auxiliary string `r`.

To fix this, the program should first construct the auxiliary string `r` from the encoded string, then create a reverse mapping to decode the string correctly. Hereâ€™s a corrected version of the `func_1` function:

```python
def func_1(encoded: str) -> str:
    # Construct the auxiliary string r
    r = sorted(set(encoded))
    
    # Create a reverse mapping
    mapping = {char: r[-i-1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    
    # Decode the encoded string
    decoded = ''.join(mapping[char] for char in encoded)
    
    return decoded
```

This corrected version ensures that the auxiliary string `r` is constructed correctly and the reverse mapping is used to decode the string accurately.
