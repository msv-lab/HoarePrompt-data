Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and os.system('cls') has been called.**

The code `os.system('cls')` clears the terminal or command prompt window. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `t` and `n`. Therefore, the value range of `t` remains unchanged, and `n` is still an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. The only change is that the terminal or command prompt window has been cleared.
