Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes two integers, `t` and `n`, where `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 50, and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. Based on these values, the function returns a result.**

However, since the function definition itself does not explicitly mention accepting `t` and `n`, the description focuses on the implied parameters and their constraints.
