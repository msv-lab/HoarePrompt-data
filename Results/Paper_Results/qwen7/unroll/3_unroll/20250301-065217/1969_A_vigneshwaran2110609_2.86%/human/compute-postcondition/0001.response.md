Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables in the loop head**: The loop head contains the variable `i` and the value `n`.

2. **Determine the initial state of `i` and `n`**:
   - `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `n` is an input integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where each integer \(p_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\), \(p_i \neq i\), and all \(p_i\) are distinct.

3. **Adjust the state for the loop to execute**:
   - The loop will start with `i` set to 0 and increment `i` until it reaches `n`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `i` must be 0 initially, and `n` must be within the specified range.

Given these points, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `i` should be 0.
- `n` must be within the range \(2 \leq n \leq 50\).

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`i` is 0, `n` must be between 2 and 50 inclusive**.
