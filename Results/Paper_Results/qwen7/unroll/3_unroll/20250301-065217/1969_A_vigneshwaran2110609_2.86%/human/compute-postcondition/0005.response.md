Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 50), followed by a list of `n` integers `p` (1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ `n`, `p_i` ≠ `i`, and all `p_i` are distinct). It then checks for each element `p_i` in the list whether `p[p_i - 1]` equals `p_i - 1`. If this condition is met for any element, it prints "2"; otherwise, it prints "3". The function does not return any value but produces output based on the condition checks. The final state includes the printed outputs for each test case.**
