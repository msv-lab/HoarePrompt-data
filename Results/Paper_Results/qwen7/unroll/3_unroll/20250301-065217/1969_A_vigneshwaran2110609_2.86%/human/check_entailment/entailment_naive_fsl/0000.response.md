Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where no pair of friends can attend the party together. Specifically, the program checks if `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` for each friend, which means it checks if a friend is their own best friend's best friend. However, this condition is not necessary for the friends to attend the party. Instead, the program should check for pairs of friends where both friends receive invitations.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
4
2 3 4 1
```
In this case, if Monocarp sends invitations to friends 1 and 2, both friends will attend because they are each other's best friends. However, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 2.

To fix this, the program needs to find pairs of friends where both friends receive invitations and ensure that at least 2 friends attend the party.
