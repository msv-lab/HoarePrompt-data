Output State: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, n is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 50, p is a list of n integers where each integer p_i satisfies 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, p_i ≠ i, and all p_i are distinct. After executing the loop, the output consists of either "2" or "3" printed for each iteration, depending on whether the condition `l[l[i] - 1] == l[i] - 1` was met for any `i` in the inner loop. The values of `x` and `l` are updated based on user input during each iteration, but the final state of `p` remains unchanged.
